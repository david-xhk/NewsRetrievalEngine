MANILA: Philippine security forces arrested on Wednesday the main financier and logistics supporter of the pro-Islamic State militants who have for weeks been battling government troops for control of a southern town, the army said.  The militants from a faction known as the Maute group, seized the town or Marawi on May 23 and are resisting daily assaults by government forces using aircraft and artillery, and with help from allies the United States and Australia.  The fighting in the largely Muslim town in south of the predominantly Christian Philippines has alarmed neighbours, fearful that Islamic State is bent on gaining a foothold in the region as it loses ground in the Middle East.  Security forces raided a village not far from Marawi and detained three suspects found with ammunition and material for making bombs, an army spokesman, Brigadier-General Gilbert Gapay, said.  One of those detained was an important supporter of the Maute group who Gapay identified as Monaliza Romato, alias Monay.  The woman is a niece of the matriarch of the Maute clan, whose men-folk lead the Marawi attack. Two of seven Maute brothers, Omar and Abdullah, were educated in the Middle East, and were the main planners of the assault on Marawi, the military has said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""Monay has replaced her aunt as the main financier and logistic supporter of the militant group,"" Gapay said in a statement.  ""The arrest will adversely affect the logistics support network of the group,"" he said.  The raid, seizure of weapons and the arrests would also prevent the militants from mounting diversionary attacks, he said.  REPLENISHING WEAPONS  More than 400 people have been killed in the fighting in Marawi. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and about 20 percent of the centre of the town has been destroyed.  On Wednesday, military aircraft dropped bombs on the town while ground forces tried to advance from house to house.  President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law on Mindanao island, where Marawi is located, for 60 days when the fighting erupted and Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said there was pressure on the military to defeat the militants before it expires on July 23.  That is also a day before Duterte is due to deliver his annual state of the nation address in Congress.  Lorenzana said the military last week sent an aircraft to the United States to stock up on various bombs and rockets, supplies of which were running out.  U.S. forces are providing Philippine troops with technical assistance for the battle while Australia has sent two surveillance planes.  In another part of Mindanao, soldiers on Tuesday found the beheaded bodies of two Vietnamese sailors abducted a year ago by militants from the Abu Sayyaf group.  Three Vietnamese sailors are still being held by Abu Sayyaf, who, in all, hold 14 foreigners and eight Philippine citizens.  Vietnam denounced the killing of its citizens.  ""Vietnam strongly condemns all savage and inhumane kidnapping and murderous acts and believes that these acts must be punished properly,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters.  The Abu Sayyaf militants are allied with the Maute group.  The fighting in Marawi erupted on May 23 when security forces tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf leader who the government believes is Islamic State's ""emir"", or leader, in the Philippines, and who was in the town with Maute fighters at the time.  Lorenzana said this week Hapilon is believed to be hiding in a Marawi mosque.  (Reporting by Manuel Mogato and Karen Lema; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel)",en,terrorattack,,

One was jailed for six years, the other for three.  They were suspected of plotting an attack similar to the November 2015 militant rampage in Paris that left 130 people dead.

KABUL (Reuters) - A bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators visiting Afghanistan on Tuesday called for a new strategy from the Trump administration to turn the tide against an increasingly strong Taliban insurgency and end the longest war in U.S. history.  The delegation led by Senator John McCain was in Kabul on a regional trip that included two days in neighbouring Pakistan.  The visit preceded an expected Trump review later in the month of the strategy for the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ longest war, now in its 16th year, a subject that was largely absent from last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presidential campaign.  Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year and has made Afghanistan the second-ranking country in people seeking refugee status abroad last year, behind Syria.  McCain said in a Kabul press briefing on Tuesday at NATO-coalition headquarters that ""none of us would say that we are on a course to success here in Afghanistan"".  ""That needs to change and quickly,"" added McCain, a sharp critic of Trump within their Republican party.  McCain was accompanied by U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse and David Perdue on the regional tour.  Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said she came to get ""the view on the ground about what is happening"" in Afghanistan.  ""We need a strategy in the United States that defines our role in Afghanistan, defines our objective and explains how we can get from here to there,"" Warren said.  U.S. officials have told Reuters that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will present Trump with strategic options for Afghanistan by mid-July.  Last month, Trump gave Mattis the authority to set American troop levels in Afghanistan, but as commander in chief Trump must sign off on an overall strategy for the war.  U.S. security officials have privately said the most likely options will be to increase training and air support by 3,000-5,000 troops for still-inexperienced Afghan security forces, while also tracking down al Qaeda, Islamic State and other global Islamist militants based in Afghanistan.  The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has said ""several thousand"" more foreign troops Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mostly trainers - are needed to break a military stalemate with the Taliban.  In 2001, a U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan toppled the Taliban regime, whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned most women from public life and executed people not seen as sufficiently pious, such as men with beards not considered long enough.  More than 15 years later, about 13,000 U.S. and allied troops remain in Afghanistan as part of a training and advising mission in support of an elected government that has increasingly been losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory.  Several thousand more American troops operate under a counterterrorism mission aimed at groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda.  (Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Mark Heinrich)",en,terrorattack,,

PUTRAJAYA: Health Minister Dr S Subramaniam says the rabies outbreak in Serian may be due to a serious outbreak in Kalimantan, and a wild dog may have crossed the border and brought it into Sarawak.  He said the health ministry was informed that there had been an active outbreak of rabies in Kalimantan. However, no figures were provided on the number of cases reported there.  Subramaniam said it was not an unusual occurrence, adding that it had happened before where a stray dog with the rabies infection had crossed over the Thailand border into Perlis, spreading the infection.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If humans can cross through our forest, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure a dog can too,Ã¢â‚¬Â Subramaniam said at a press conference here today.  He said his ministry is currently helping identify the symptoms of rabies among those who have been bitten by dogs.  Subramaniam said 11 active case detection (ACD) teams are on the ground to provide health education related to rabies as well as information on preventive measures to the residents of villages in the area.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They have visited 19 villages and covered 2,098 doors/houses and checked 6,094 people so far,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  The 68 people reported to have suffered dog bites in the area since April 1 this year will be given the vaccine and monitored as rabies symptoms take some time to surface.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have sufficient amounts of vaccine to manage the outbreak, for both the people and animals.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are giving vaccinations to those bitten in the perimeter of 10 kilometres from where there have been confirmed cases of rabies,Ã¢â‚¬Â Subramaniam said.  He added that the veterinary department has also been conducting checks on dogs in the surrounding areas, both strays and pets.  Subramaniam said pet dogs may be given priority for vaccination as they are in constant contact with humans. He added that the decision on how strays would be vaccinated will be left to the veterinary department.  He advised people to take precautions and get their pets vaccinated with the anti-rabies vaccine.  It was reported today that two of three rabies-infected children in Sarawak had died.

In neighbouring Syria, US-backed forces gained ground after air strikes by the international anti-IS coalition punched holes in the wall of the Old City in Raqa, where they are waging a parallel offensive against the militants.  ""Today, our advance was easier than yesterday,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Haider Hussein, a commander in Iraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service.  ""We took control of more than 200 metres (yards) today and there are less than 200 metres remaining toward the Tigris River,"" Hussein said, referring to the waterway marking the eastern edge of remaining IS-held territory in the city.  More than eight months since the start of the operation, IS has gone from fully controlling Mosul to holding a limited area in the Old City on its western side.  But Iraqi troops in Mosul have faced tough fighting and a spike in suicide bombings in recent days, commanders have said.

Streets were strewn with clothing and other objects left by civilians who were fleeing the fighting. ""The enemy is not a regular army,"" said Brigadier General Nabil al-Fatlawi, a CTS commander.  'MAJOR VICTORY'    ""It's a street to street battle,"" said Fatlawi, who expects the battle to be over in ""a few days"".  Despite the ongoing fighting, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated Iraq's people, security forces and the Shiite religious leadership ""on the achievement of this major victory in Mosul"" in remarks broadcast Tuesday night.  But automatic weapons fire and explosions on Wednesday made clear that the final stage of the battle for the city was not yet over.  Iraqi forces launched the operation to retake Mosul on Oct 17, advancing to the city, recapturing its eastern side and then setting their sights on its smaller but more densely populated west.  The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces - an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters - have been battling IS in Syria, and made gains Wednesday in their drive to retake Raqa from the militants.

""They are now approximately 300 metres (yards) from the Old Mosque - within firing range of it,"" said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.  Syria's civil war provided fertile ground for IS, which seized territory in that country and also overran large areas north and west of Baghdad.  The militants have since lost significant ground, but the recapture of Mosul and Raqa will not mark the end of the war against IS.  IS holds other territory in both countries, and is expected to revert to its insurgent roots in Iraq, carrying out bombings and hit-and-run attacks that were its hallmark in past years.",en,terrorattack,,

It was the latest in a spate of attacks on Kenyan security services since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to join a African Union force charged with neutralising militant and other armed groups and bolstering its U.N.-backed government.  Al Shabaab gunmen attacked the police station in the town of Pandanguo in the coastal district of Lamu around 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), forcing villagers to flee, according to residents. The area is near Kenya's long, porous border with Somalia.  The militants also raided a dispensary for drugs and houses for food items, clothes and other valuables, witnesses said. Smoke could be seen rising from the village later in the day.  By 6 p.m., three policemen had been killed and a gunbattle was continuing, police said.  ""The attackers used RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),"" George Kinoti, Kenya's national police spokesman, said in a text message. ""Reinforcements sent to engage the enemy have killed several terrorists.""

Now, today, there are sporadic exchanges of gunfire between us and the police in the outskirts of the town but we still control the town,"" he said.  The raid follows a series of attacks in Kenya claimed by Somali militants that have killed at least 28 people in the last six weeks. Most have taken place near the Somali border.  The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militia is fighting to overthrow Somalia's weak, U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law in the Horn of Africa state.  They ramped up attacks in neighbouring Kenya after Kenyan troops entered Somalia to join the AU peacekeeping force there.

The pair were brothers of Said Saouti, a member of the Kamikaze Bikers club who was jailed for six years in 2016 for belonging to a terrorist group, according to media reports confirmed by the source, who asked not to be named.  Separately, a joint Franco-Belgian operation picked up a man in northern France on suspicion of having links to the Kamikaze Riders, a notorious bikers club from around Brussels.  The series of raids in Brussels also turned up an arms cache which another source said included two Kalashnikov assault rifles.  Reports said explosives were discovered during the operation in the immigrant-heavy Anderlecht district but this was not confirmed.  Authorities were drawn to the Saouti brothers on suspicion that they had been radicalised and were planning an attack, which appeared to be borne out by the weapons found, according to reports.

Only last month, a soldier shot dead a man who had attempted to set off a bomb in Central Station, right in the heart of the Belgian capital, sparking fears that further incidents might be in the offing.  Investigators said at the time they had evidence that the suspect, a 36-year-old Moroccan national, had IS sympathies.  They also found explosive materials in a raid on his home in Molenbeek, a Brussels district where many of the militants who carried out the deadly Paris attacks in November 2015 and those in the Belgian capital in March 2016, grew up and found shelter.  NO LINK TO PARIS-BRUSSELS PROBE    In an earlier statement on the overnight raids, the Belgian federal prosecutors' office said ""various weapons"" were found and that four people had been ""arrested and taken in for questioning"".  A prosecutors' spokesman said separately the raids were ""directly linked"" to members of the Kamikaze Riders, not to the investigation into the Paris and Brussels attacks.  In France, a source who asked not to be named, said a 42-year-old arrested in a suburb of the northern city of Lille was suspected of plotting a ""violent action"".  Several members of the Kamikaze Riders, formed in 2003 and known for testing the patience of the police, were suspected of links to foiled attacks in Brussels in late 2015.  In October 2016, two members of the group, including Said Saouti, were convicted of belonging to a terrorist group.  They were suspected of plotting an attack similar to the November 2015 carnage in Paris that left 130 people dead.  Four months later, militants also struck in Brussels, hitting the airport and the metro, killing 32 people and leaving hundreds injured.  The killings rocked Belgium and caused consternation when it became clear that many of those involved had been known to the authorities for some time.  Several came from Molenbeek, home to a large Moroccan immigrant community, and had hidden there after the attacks before finally being tracked down by the police.",en,terrorattack,,

It was the latest in a spate of attacks on Kenyan security services since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to join a African Union force charged with neutralising militant and other armed groups and bolstering its U.N.-backed government.  Al Shabaab gunmen attacked the police station in the town of Pandanguo in the coastal district of Lamu around 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), forcing villagers to flee, according to residents. The area is near Kenya's long, porous border with Somalia.  The militants also raided a dispensary for drugs and houses for food items, clothes and other valuables, witnesses said. Smoke could be seen rising from the village later in the day.  By 6 p.m., three policemen had been killed and a gunbattle was continuing, police said.  ""The attackers used RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),"" George Kinoti, Kenya's national police spokesman, said in a text message. ""Reinforcements sent to engage the enemy have killed several terrorists.""  In July 2014, more than 60 militants attacked the same village, torched houses and stole drugs at the same dispensary.  Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, confirmed Wednesday's attack to Reuters by phone.  ""We burned the police station and captured cars. Now, today, there are sporadic exchanges of gunfire between us and the police in the outskirts of the town but we still control the town,"" he said.  The raid follows a series of attacks in Kenya claimed by Somali militants that have killed at least 28 people in the last six weeks. Most have taken place near the Somali border.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Because of the way we live these days, we are all vulnerable,Ã¢â‚¬Â director Su Rynard told Fox News, noting that changes like increased urbanization and travel have contributed to the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.  POWASSAN VIRUS: POTENTIALLY FATAL TICK DISEASE THAT CAN BE TRANSMITTED IN MINUTES REPORTED IN MAINE  In fact, according to the World Health Organization, of the all disease-transmitting insects, the mosquito is the greatest menace, spreading diseases including malaria, dengue, and yellow fever which cause several million deaths each year.  One of the most recent threats? Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause birth defects in children and that has so far been spotted in 70 countries and territories around the world.  Are mosquitos a serious threat  While mosquitos are not necessarily more of a threat now than they have been in the past, John Beier, an entomologist at the University of Miami's Department of Public Health Sciences, told Fox News that they carry with them significant risks, including transmission of diseases.  And Beier agrees that increased travel is a concern.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we saw last year with Zika,Ã¢â‚¬Â Beier said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A lot of travelers were coming in and bringing it. And about 80 percent of the people infected with Zika donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show any symptomsÃ¢â‚¬â€they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily know they are carrying the virus.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In Miami especially, Beier said, a large number of tourists and visitors come in from other countries, potentially bringing such diseases with them.  What you can do to protect yourself  When it comes to combatting mosquito-borne diseases, there are a few precautions you can take: pregnant women especially should avoid mosquitos by staying inside, using repellents, and wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts, Beier said. He noted that people in areas that are most at riskÃ¢â‚¬â€including South Florida, Texas, and parts of the southeastern United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â€have to be most careful.  TICK THAT CAUSES MEAT ALLERGY IN HUMANS HEADS NORTH  And, since mosquitos breed in tiny amounts of water, you can also protect yourself by making sure to remove any standing waterÃ¢â‚¬â€such as in flower pots or kiddie poolsÃ¢â‚¬â€around your home, Rynard said.  Ultimately, awareness is key, Rynard said. She added that it's important to understand that such diseases are not distant problems in faraway countries.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Disease donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop at borders,"" she said. ""We all have to be vigilant in a new way. We have to think globally about these problems and recognize that if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll really be in trouble.Ã¢â‚¬Â  ""MOSQUITO"" airs July 6 at 9 p.m., ET.",en,diseas,,

The four were detained in a sweeping security raid last week in refugee settlements in and around the border town of Arsal that netted 355 Syrians. The town and the surrounding area was the scene of a major cross-border attack in 2014, when a number of Lebanese soldiers were abducted.  None of the detained Syrians have been charged so far. During the raids, at least four Syrians detonated explosives vests, killing a Syrian girl and wounding seven Lebanese soldiers.  In Arsal on Wednesday, Syrian refugees blocked a road to prevent the return of the bodies of the four for burial, demanding that autopsies take place first.  But the town mayor ordered they be taken to the local cemetery, a refugee from the Syrian town of Qusayr told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of his precarious legal status in Lebanon.  According to photos seen by the AP, two of the bodies showed heavy bruising on the face and abdomen Ã¢â‚¬â€ which human rights lawyer Nabil Halabi said was consistent with beatings. A third body was missing the head, another photo showed.  Mayor Bassil Hujeiri denied interfering with the ambulances, insisting the army controls traffic in and out of Arsal.  Initially, the military was praised in the media for the raids but Syrian activists raised allegations of abuse after photographs surfaced showing the detainees with their faces to the ground, many bare-chested and handcuffed. The army over the weekend dismissed allegations of abuse, saying mass detentions were necessary to combat terrorism.  A military statement on Tuesday said the four Syrians who died had chronic conditions that deteriorated because of soaring summer temperatures. They were transferred to a hospital for medical treatment immediately after their arrest on Friday but died before they could be interrogated, the army said.  Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said that ""in light of the army's own admission that the health condition of the detainees deteriorated while in custody, a formal, transparent and independent investigation must be launched.""  ""In case of wrongdoing, those responsible for the deaths should be held accountable,"" she added.  The Syrian National Coalition, a Turkey-based opposition group, also called for an investigation, claiming that at least 10 detained Syrians had died in Lebanese custody following last week's raid and alleged that Lebanese authorities were rushing the funerals without carrying out autopsies to determine the cause of death.  There was no immediate response from the military to the latest accusations.",en,terrorattack,,

Tens of thousands of people have joined the opposition CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu on his 425-km (265-mile) march from the capital Ankara to Istanbul, a protest launched after a deputy from the secularist CHP was jailed on spying charges.  Kilicdaroglu, 68, said there had been rumours his ""justice march"", which has grown into a wider anti-government protest, could be targeted by ""provocations"" as it approached Istanbul, where it is set to end with a mass rally on Sunday.  ""Following a nice tip-off, our police detained a group of six Islamic State militants. They were planning to attack the convoy with a minibus,"" Kayseri Governor Suleyman Kamci told the website of Hurriyet newspaper.  Kamci did not specify what sort of assault was allegedly planned. Islamic State (IS) has carried out both bomb and gun attacks in Turkey in the past.  Police and officials declined to comment but state-run Anadolu news agency carried a similar report.  Kamci said the suspects rented a black minibus in Kayseri on Tuesday, and that four of them were subsequently detained in Kayseri and two in Kocaeli province, through which the protesters were marching on Wednesday.  A video purporting to show part of the police operation and published on Turkish news websites showed officers, some with assault rifles, storming a black minibus waiting in traffic on a main highway and then leading away at least one man.  Flags of the ruling AK Party were found in the minibus, Kamci said.  ""PROVOCATION ATTEMPTS""  Turkish media said earlier that police had detained 37 IS suspects in anti-terrorism operations in provinces across the country, while officials said another suspect was arrested at the border with Syria while carrying more than 5 kg (11 lb) of explosives.  CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said he had been told the police operation was routine and not related to the march itself.  ""We want to complete the march and hold our rally against all provocation attempts in a safe manner,"" he told reporters.  President Tayyip Erdogan has accused the protesters of ""acting together with terrorist groups"", referring to Kurdish militants and followers of the U.S.-based Islamic cleric accused of orchestrating the attempted coup in July 2016.  The protesters deny the accusations, with Kilicdaroglu saying they are marching for ""justice"" and accusing the government of creating a one-party state in the wake of the failed military coup a year ago.  In a security crackdown since then, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial, and 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs. Ankara has also closed 130 media outlets and jailed around 160 journalists, union data show.  Stepping up his challenge to the government, Kilicdaroglu on Tuesday appealed to the European Court of Human Rights over the April referendum that granted Erdogan sweeping new powers.

It was the latest eruption of political violence in three months of chaos in the oil-rich, poverty-stricken South American country.  The attackers were supporting President Nicolas Maduro against opposition demands for elections to remove him from office.  Military police guarding the site stood by as about 100 intruders brandishing sticks and pipes broke through the front gate of the National Assembly and into the interior gardens.  The mob reached as far as the corridors of the congressional building, striking and injuring lawmakers. The attackers, one of them holding a gun, ordered journalists to leave the premises.  The speaker of the assembly, Julio Borges, in a Twitter message named five lawmakers who were hurt in the violence. Some were taken away for medical treatment.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""This does not hurt as much as seeing every day how we are losing our country,"" one of them, Armando Armas, told reporters as he got into an ambulance with his head wrapped in bloody bandages.  Deputies also said that two employees of the assembly were hurt.  'SAVAGES'  Tension is high in Venezuela after three months of anti-government protests that have seen 91 people killed in clashes with police.  Protesters blame President Nicolas Maduro for a desperate economic crisis. He says the chaos is the result of a US-backed capitalist conspiracy by the opposition.  ""The government always resorts to violence,"" said opposition lawmaker Stalin Gonzalez after Wednesday's attack.  Another deputy, Simon Calzadilla, vowed: ""We will continue to face up to these savages.""  The opposition-controlled legislature was holding a special session to mark independence day when the government supporters burst in.  Earlier Maduro's vice-president Tareck El Aissami had made an impromptu appearance in the congress along with the head of the armed forces, Vladimir Padrino Lopez and ministers.  El Aissami made an address in which he called on supporters of Maduro to come to the legislature to show support for the president.  A crowd of Maduro supporters held a rally outside the building for several hours before breaking into the grounds during a recess.  'TROJAN HORSE'  Government and opposition have accused each other of using armed groups to sow violence.  The opposition has accused plainclothes armed pro-government groups of attacking protesters.  While the chaos erupted in the grounds of the assembly, Maduro was watching a military parade in another part of Caracas, with troops marching and armored vehicles rumbling by.  In a speech at the parade, he demanded that the military be ""ever loyal, never traitors."" ""Let no one become a Trojan horse,"" he said. ""Let no one become a servant of the oligarchy.""  Maduro retains the public backing of the military high command - a key factor in keeping him in power, according to analysts.  But the president last month said he was replacing four other senior commanders of the armed forces.  Maduro has infuriated his opponents by launching a plan to form an assembly to rewrite the constitution.  Opponents say he will pack the ""constituent assembly"" with allies to cling to power.  Voting for members of the assembly is scheduled for Jul 30.  ""However, the political crisis is so fluid that the country could reach a tipping point before then,"" wrote analysts from the Eurasia Group consultancy last week in a note.

The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near Kurdish-held areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ""declaration of war"" which could trigger clashes within days.  QAMISHLI, Syria/ANKARA: The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near Kurdish-held areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ""declaration of war"" which could trigger clashes within days.  Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus retorted that his country was not declaring war but that its forces would respond to any hostile move by the YPG, which he described as a small-scale army formed by the United States.  The mounting tensions between two U.S. allies in northwestern Syria risk opening yet another front in the multi-sided conflict, in which outside powers are playing ever greater roles.  They could also distract the YPG from the U.S.-backed campaign it is spearheading to capture Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa, some 200 km (125 miles) away.  Asked by Reuters whether he expected a conflict with Turkey in northern Syria, where the two sides have exchanged artillery fire in recent days, YPG Commander Sipan Hemo accused Turkey of preparing for a major military campaign in the Aleppo and Afrin area.  ""These (Turkish) preparations have reached level of a declaration of war and could lead to the outbreak of actual clashes in the coming days,"" he said in emailed comments. ""We will not stand idly by against this potential aggression.""  Advertisement  Advertisement  Turkey's policy in northern Syria has been focussed on containing the growing sway of Kurdish groups that have established autonomous regions since Syria's war began in 2011.  Ankara says the YPG represents a security threat, seeing it as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been fighting an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.  ""This is not a declaration of war. We are making preparations against potential threats,"" Kurtulmus told Reuters in an interview. ""Their (YPG) primary goal is a threat to Turkey, and if Turkey sees a YPG movement in northern Syria that is a threat to it, it will retaliate in kind.""  President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ready to carry out ground operations against Kurdish forces in northern Syria along with the rebel forces it backs there if necessary.  ""If there is a threat against us, our troops will conduct any operations with the Free Syrian Army (FSA) on the ground,"" he told France 24 television in an interview shown later on Wednesday.  Turkish forces deployed in northern Syria last year in support of FSA groups in an operation that forced Islamic State away from the border and also drove a wedge between YPG-held areas.  In recent weeks, Turkey has sent reinforcements into the area north of Aleppo, according to Turkey-backed rebel groups who have established control over a section of the Turkish-Syrian frontier with Ankara's support.  Hemo was last week cited as saying the YPG had a plan to capture that area between the towns of Azaz and Jarablus. Asked about that remark, he described the Turkish intervention as ""occupation"" of Syrian land, and said the YPG had never ""threatened Turkey or its security"".  LONG-TERM PLANS  Turkey, a NATO member, has been incensed by the U.S. decision to ally with the YPG. Washington took the decision to arm the group before the final assault on Raqqa began in June.  The YPG is fighting under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Arab fighters.  In separate comments to the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper published on Wednesday, Hemo said the United States had established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria controlled by the YPG or SDF, including a major airbase near Kobani, a town at the border with Turkey.  Citing operational security, the coalition said it did not confirm or deny information about ""specific capabilities, force numbers, locations or movement of forces in Iraq and Syria"".  Hemo indicated the YPG would keep fighting Islamic State even after its defeat in Raqqa, saying it was committed with ""the international coalition to cleansing Syria of terrorism and establishing a political system capable of achieving real democratic transformation"".  Turkish defence ministry sources said last month the United States had pledged that weapons provided to the YPG would be taken back once Islamic State was defeated. Turkey says that is not credible.  ""There has never been an incident where a group in the Middle East has been armed, and they returned the weapons,"" Kurtulmus said. The United States ""have formed more than a terrorist organisation there, they formed a small-scale army.""  He also warned the YPG not to try to drive out Arab or Turkmen residents from the town of Tel Rifaat, which is close to Afrin and controlled by YPG and Arab allies in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has left open the possibility of longer-term assistance to the YPG, saying the U.S. may need to supply them with weapons and equipment even after the capture of Raqqa.  Hemo said U.S. officials had denied any intention to take away the YPG's weapons and that the YPG would be needing more support due to its longer-term plans to tackle the remnants of Islamic State.

Four lawmakers were injured. One of them, Americo de Grazia, had to be taken in a stretcher to an ambulance suffering from convulsions, said a fellow congressman.  VENEZUELA: THE INCREDIBLE LEGACY OF AN EXPERIMENT WITH SOCIALISM  ""This doesn't hurt as much as watching how every day how we lose a little bit more of our country,"" Armando Arias said from inside an ambulance as he was being treated for head wounds that spilled blood across his clothes.  The attack, in plain view of national guardsmen assigned to protect the legislature, comes amid three months of often-violent confrontations between security forces and protesters who accuse the government of trying to establish a dictatorship by jailing foes, pushing aside the opposition-controlled legislature and rewriting the constitution to avoid fair elections.  Tensions were already high after Vice President Tareck El Aissami made an unannounced morning visit to the neoclassical legislature, accompanied by top government and military officials, for an event celebrating independence day.  Standing next to a display case holding Venezuela's declaration of independence from Spain, he said global powers are once again trying to subjugate Venezuela.  ""We still haven't finished definitively breaking the chains of the empire,"" El Aissami said, adding that President Nicolas Maduro's plans to rewrite the constitution Ã¢â‚¬â€ a move the opposition sees as a power-grab Ã¢â‚¬â€ offers Venezuela the best chance to be truly independent.  After he left, dozens of government supporters set up a picket outside the building, heckling lawmakers with menacing chants and eventually invading the legislature themselves.  Despite the violence, lawmakers approved a plan by the opposition to hold a symbolic referendum on July 16 that would give voters the chance to reject Maduro's plans to draft a new political charter.  Related Image Expand / Collapse  Later Maduro condemned the violence, calling for a full investigation during a speech while attending a military parade.  IN VENEZUELA, BECAUSE SOME BELIEVE SOCIALISM IS THE ANSWER TO INEQUALITY, PEOPLE STARVE  The clash followed Tuesday's appearance of a 5-minute video posted by a former police inspector who allegedly stole a helicopter and fired on two government buildings last week.  Oscar Perez, repeating a call for rebellion among the security forces, said that he was in Caracas after abandoning the helicopter along the Caribbean coast and was ready for the ""second phase"" of his campaign to free his homeland from what he called the corrupt rule of President Nicolas Maduro and his ""assassin"" allies.  Perez gave no other details but pledged to join youth who have been protesting on the streets the past three months against Maduro.  ""Stop talking. Get on the streets. Take action. Fight,"" he said in the video, sitting before a Venezuelan flag and with what looks like an assault rifle by his side. He also denounced Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution.  Related Image Expand / Collapse  ""If this constitutional assembly goes through, Venezuela will cease to exist because we'll have given away the country to the Cubans,"" he said.  The bold though largely harmless June 27 attack shocked Venezuelans who had grown accustomed to almost-daily clashes since April between often-violent youth protesters and security forces that have left more than 90 people dead and hundreds injured.  Perez apparently piloted the stolen police helicopter that sprayed 15 bullets toward the Interior Ministry and dropped at least two grenades over the supreme court building.  While Maduro claimed Perez had stolen the helicopter on a U.S.-backed mission to oust him from power, many in the opposition questioned whether the incident was a staged by the government to distract attention from the president's increasingly authoritarian rule.  Adding to the intrigue is Perez's colorful past.  In 2015, he produced and starred in a film called ""Suspended Death,"" and several photos show him in fatigues, scuba diving while toting an assault rifle, skydiving and standing in action poses with a German shepherd by his side. In his political debut, he read a manifesto in which he claimed to be part of a group of disgruntled members of Venezuela's security forces determined to save the country's democracy.  Maduro said a massive loss of life was avoided because Venezuela's air defense system was quickly activated. But Perez said in the video that the strike produced no casualties because he had taken care to avoid them.  Neither of the buildings he attacked suffered damage. The helicopter he stole was found 24 hours later, abandoned in a verdant valley near the Caribbean coastline outside Caracas.

Security forces raided a village not far from the besieged city and detained three suspects found with ammunition and material for making bombs, said an army spokesman, Brigadier-General Gilbert Gapay.  One of those detained was an important supporter of the Maute group who Brig-Gen Gapay identified as Monaliza Romato, alias Monay.  The woman is a niece of the matriarch of the Maute clan, whose men-folk led the Marawi attack.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monay has replaced her aunt as the main financier and logistic supporter of the militant group,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Brig-Gen Gapay in a statement.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The arrest will adversely affect the logistics support network of the group.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The raid, seizure of weapons and arrests would also prevent the militants from mounting diversionary attacks, he added.  The militants seized the town of Marawi on May 23 and are resisting daily assaults by government forces using aircraft and artillery, and with help from allies: The United States and Australia. Two of seven Maute brothers, Omar and Abdullah, were educated in the Middle East, and were the main planners of the assault on Marawi, the military has said.  The fighting in the largely Muslim town in the south of the predominantly Christian Philippines has alarmed regional neighbours, fearful that the IS is bent on gaining a foothold in the region as it loses ground in the Middle East.  More than 400 people have been killed in the fighting in Marawi. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and about 20 per cent of the centre of the town has been destroyed.  Military aircraft yesterday dropped bombs on the town while ground forces tried to advance from house to house.  President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law on Mindanao island, where Marawi is located, for 60 days when the fighting erupted and Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said there was pressure on the military to defeat the militants before it expires on July 23.  That is also a day before Mr Duterte is due to deliver his annual state of the nation address in Congress.  Mr Lorenzana said the military last week sent an aircraft to the US to stock up on various bombs and rockets, supplies of which were running out.  US forces are providing Philippine troops with technical assistance for the battle, while Australia has sent two surveillance planes.  In another part of Mindanao, soldiers on Tuesday found the beheaded bodies of two Vietnamese sailors abducted a year ago by militants from the Abu Sayyaf group.  Three Vietnamese sailors are still being held by Abu Sayyaf, which is holding 14 foreigners and eight Philippine citizens.  The Abu Sayyaf militants are allied with the Maute group.  The fighting in Marawi erupted when security forces tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf leader who the government believes is ISÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“emirÃ¢â‚¬Â, or leader, in the Philippines, and who was in the town with Maute fighters at the time.  Mr Lorenzana said this week that Hapilon is believed to be hiding in a Marawi mosque. REUTERS",en,terrorattack,,
27,320235,todayonline,None,Venezuelan copter attacker vows to fight on; lawmakers beaten,http://www.todayonline.com/world/venezuelan-helicopter-pilot-appears-video-vows-keep-fighting,,2017-07-06 04:50:35.056,"CARACAS - The Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in Caracas last week appeared in an internet video on Wednesday vowing to continue fighting for the ""liberation"" of his country.  And in another chaotic day for Venezuela, convulsed by protests since April, pro-government groups burst into the opposition-controlled National Assembly, witnesses said, beating up several lawmakers and journalists.  Opponents of President Nicolas Maduro are demanding general elections to end socialist rule and solutions to the OPEC nation's brutal economic crisis. The government says the opposition is seeking a violent coup with U.S. support.  ""Once again we are in Caracas, ready and willing to continue our struggle for the liberation of our country,"" police pilot Oscar Perez said in a video, wearing a military uniform and wool cap, with a Venezuelan flag and a rifle behind him.  He had not been seen since he hijacked a helicopter last week and flew through Caracas pulling a ""Freedom"" banner. He opened fire and dropped grenades on the Interior Ministry and Supreme Court, but nobody was injured.  Maduro, the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez, called that attack a terrorist assault to overthrow him.  But many government critics doubt the official version, and some even suggested it may have been staged to divert attention from the country's economic and political crises.  In the video, Perez said the attack was ""perfectly achieved"" with no collateral damage ""because it was planned, because we are not murderers like you, Mr. Nicolas Maduro.""  Perez said he had staged an emergency landing on the Caribbean coast following the attack, and returned to the capital after hiking through mountains. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Perez, who has portrayed himself as a James Bond-cum-Rambo figure on social media, is also an actor who starred in a 2015 movie about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman.  Though he has claimed wider support within the security forces, Perez's actions so far appear to be a rogue stunt organized by a small group of disaffected policemen.  PIPES, STICKS AND STONES  Venezuela's opposition has been staging demonstrations against Maduro for three months, saying he has created a dictatorship and destroyed the country's economy.  At least 90 people have been killed in the protests.  They say Maduro is seeking to consolidate control through a Constituent Assembly, a superbody that will be elected at the end of July. The opposition has promised to boycott the vote, which it says is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party.  ""We are fully sure of what we are doing and if we must give up our lives, we will hand them over to the people,"" Perez said in the video. ""If this constituent assembly takes place, there will be no Venezuela.""  While Maduro was leading a military parade for Independence Day on Wednesday, the opposition-led National Assembly held a session. They denounced the president as a ""dictator"" and approved a plebiscite that the opposition is organizing for July 16, asking Venezuelans what they think of Maduro's plans.  During the session, pro-government groups gathered outside the legislature in downtown Caracas, and several dozen people burst into the compound armed with metal pipes, sticks and stones, attacking lawmakers and journalists, witnesses said.  At least three opposition lawmakers were beaten and several journalists were robbed, witnesses said. Two lawmakers staggered around the corridors with bloodied faces.  Explosions were heard around the building, probably from fireworks, witnesses said. One lawmaker, Americo De Grazia, was wheeled out on a stretcher to be taken away by an ambulance.  ""This is Venezuela today,"" said the assembly vice president, Freddy Guevara. ""Criminals attack the National Assembly, the armed forces are complicit in this madness, but the people and the lawmakers resist and advance.""  In his Independence Day speech, Maduro condemned the violence in the assembly and asked for an investigation, but he also challenged the opposition to speak out about violence from within its ranks.  Young opposition protesters have frequently attacked security forces with stones, homemade mortars and Molotov cocktails, burned property. Protesters killed a man by dousing him in gasoline and setting him on fire.  ""I want peace for Venezuela, I don't accept violence from anyone,"" Maduro said. REUTERS",en,terrorattack,,

REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic/File Photo  BEIRUT When Abu Ahmad stepped out of his house in Raqqa after a night of heavy air strikes, he found several of his neighbours lying dead in the street.  ""I went out the next morning just to inspect,"" he said. ""I swear to God, cats were eating the corpses.""  ""We couldn't do anything with the dead bodies,"" he told Reuters in a series of voice messages from the city, the global headquarters of Islamic State. ""They were just abandoned. We informed the hospital.""  The U.S.-led coalition battling to defeat the ultra-hardline militants in Raqqa says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.  Abu Ahmad said air and artillery attacks were relentless, leaving most people holed up inside, unable to bury the dead and paralysed by fear of the warplanes and shelling by U.S.-backed forces fighting on the ground.  ""We don't dare come out of our houses,"" he said. ""There is death everywhere, the stench of death, of destruction. It's terrifying.""  He declined to give his full name out of fear for his life and his account could not be independently verified: Islamic State has imposed tight controls on communications in Raqqa, and routinely executes people accused of spying or treachery.  He said he had encountered few Islamic State militants or armoured vehicles recently in his district, which lies close to a front line in the west of the city. Many of those he did see were teenage boys with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenades.  Under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Kurdish and Arab militias are now fighting inside the historic Old City, after pushing into Raqqa last month.  SCREAMED FOR HELP  On one particularly bad day last month, Abu Ahmad had just returned from getting water at a nearby well when he said intense air strikes battered his district around Raqqa's al-Nour mosque.  Jets pounded buildings and cars near the neighbourhood bakery, killing more than 30 people, he said. The U.S.-led coalition said it was investigating the allegation.  People screamed for help in the dark and houses crumbled as the bombs fell, Abu Ahmad recalled. ""Imagine...we couldn't even do anything. The rocket launchers, the warplanes. We left them to die under the rubble,"" he said.  A few men went out to search for and rescue the injured, but they could not get any of the dead bodies out.  The Kurdish-led SDF has said it is careful to safeguard civilians in Raqqa, which Islamic State has used as a hub to plot attacks abroad.  The U.S.-led coalition also says it takes ""all reasonable precautions"" to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq.  Ahead of the final assault on Raqqa city, the U.N. human rights office raised concerns about increasing reports of civilian deaths in the area. In a May report, it said there had been ""massive civilian casualties"" already.  The United Nations estimates that 50,000 to 100,000 people are trapped in Raqqa. Witnesses said the militants have shot at those trying to escape, and people who have left in recent months reported paying large sums to smugglers to get them out.  Abu Ahmad said his parents and children had been smuggled out of the city. ""We had stocked food a while ago in anticipation of the siege,"" he added. ""But this fierce attack, we hadn't expected even one percent of this, we would have left Raqqa immediately (if we'd known).""  The U.S.-led coalition said before the assault on Raqqa that 3,000 to 4,000 IS militants were still there, even after leaders abandoned the city for territory further south.  The SDF says that Islamic State has heavily mined the old quarters of Raqqa and that the militants are doing most of their fighting at night without moving much in the daytime.  Reuters lost contact this week with Abu Ahmad. In his final message, he said he planned to get smuggled out of Raqqa and escape to the countryside.  ""That's it. It's unbearable,"" he said.  ""We are living in a horror movie.""  (Editing by Philippa Fletcher)",en,terrorattack,,

The armed group broke through the gates of the only state institution still nominally controlled by the opposition, in another episode of political violence following three months of chaos in the oil-rich but now poverty-stricken country.  The attackers were supporting President Nicolas Maduro, who faces opposition demands for elections to remove him from office - though he promptly denounced the violence.  Military police guarding the site stood by as about 100 intruders brandishing sticks and pipes broke through the front gate of the National Assembly and into the interior gardens, AFP reporters observed.  The mob reached as far as the corridors of the congressional building, striking and injuring lawmakers. The attackers, one of them holding a gun, ordered journalists to leave the premises.  The speaker of the assembly, Julio Borges, in a Twitter message named five lawmakers who were hurt in the violence. Some were taken away for medical treatment.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""This does not hurt as much as seeing every day how we are losing our country,"" one of them, Armando Armas, told reporters as he got into an ambulance with his head wrapped in bloodied bandages.  Deputies also said that two employees of the assembly were hurt.  ""I absolutely condemn these deeds. I will never be complicit in any act of violence,"" Maduro said in a speech at a military parade in Caracas. He did not acknowledge that those who stormed congress were supporters of his side.  ""I have ordered an investigation, and may justice be done.""  'DICTATORSHIP'  Three months of anti-government protests have seen 91 people killed in clashes with police.  Protesters blame Maduro for a desperate economic crisis that has caused shortages of food, medicine and such basics as soap. He says the chaos is the result of a US-backed capitalist conspiracy by the opposition.  The opposition-controlled legislature was holding a special session to mark independence day when the government supporters burst in.  ""We will not be intimidated by these acts of violence. No one here will surrender to this dictatorship,"" said senior opposition lawmaker Freddy Guevara.  Earlier Maduro's vice-president Tareck El Aissami had made an impromptu appearance in the congress along with the head of the armed forces, Vladimir Padrino Lopez and ministers.  El Aissami made an address in which he called on supporters of Maduro to come to the legislature to show support for the president.  A crowd of Maduro supporters held a rally outside the building for several hours before breaking into the grounds during a recess.  'TROJAN HORSE'  Government and opposition have accused each other of using armed groups to sow violence.  The opposition has accused plainclothes armed pro-government groups of attacking protesters.  In a speech at the military parade, Maduro demanded that the military be ""ever loyal, never traitors."" ""Let no one become a Trojan horse,"" he said. ""Let no one become a servant of the oligarchy.""  Maduro retains the public backing of the military high command - a key factor in keeping him in power, according to analysts.  But the president last month said he was replacing four other senior commanders of the armed forces.  Maduro has infuriated his opponents by launching a plan to form an assembly to rewrite the constitution.  Opponents say he will pack the ""constituent assembly"" with allies to cling to power.  Voting for members of the assembly is scheduled for Jul 30.

The pair, named as Akim and Khalid Saouti, were among four people detained overnight in the Brussels suburb of Anderlecht, according to a statement from Belgium's federal prosecutor.  A source close to the probe said the two ""radicalised"" men are brothers of Said Saouti, a member of the Kamikaze Bikers club who was jailed for six years in 2016 for recruiting people to militant organisations and supporting the Islamic State (IS) group on social media.  Separately, a joint Franco-Belgian operation picked up a man in the northern French city of Lille on suspicion of having links to the Kamikaze Riders, a notorious bikers' club from around Brussels.  A source with knowledge of the operation said that man was suspected of planning a ""violent attack"".  The prosecutor's office said police had found automatic rifles, handguns, ammunition and bulletproof vests as well as police and security guards' uniforms and ""four detonators"" in a lock-up in Anderlecht.  Advertisement  Advertisement  It said the two brothers were suspected of ""participating in the activities of a terrorist group"" and placed in custody. The two other arrested individuals were later released.  Authorities were drawn to the Saouti brothers on suspicion that they had been radicalised and were planning an attack, which appeared to be borne out by the weapons found, according to reports.  There was no information on a possible target but the police decided not to wait any longer.  The raids come with Belgium and France still on high alert after several deadly attacks claimed by IS, with troops on patrol in Brussels and Paris to guard key buildings and infrastructure.  Last month a soldier shot dead a man who had attempted to set off a bomb in Brussels' Central Station, sparking fears that further attacks could happen.  Investigators said at the time they had evidence that the suspect, a 36-year-old Moroccan national, had IS sympathies.  They also found explosive materials in a raid on his home in Molenbeek, a Brussels district where many of the militants who carried out the deadly Paris attacks in November 2015, and those in the Belgian capital in March 2016, grew up and found shelter.  NO LINK TO PARIS-BRUSSELS PROBE  A spokesman for prosecutors had said earlier that the raids were ""directly linked"" to members of the Kamikaze Riders, not to the investigation into the Paris and Brussels attacks.  In France, a source close to the probe said a 42-year-old arrested in a suburb of the northern city of Lille was suspected of plotting ""violent action"".  Several members of the Kamikaze Riders, formed in 2003 and known for testing the patience of the police, were suspected of links to foiled attacks in Brussels in late 2015.  In October 2016 two members of the gang, including Said Saouti, were convicted of belonging to a terrorist group.  They were suspected of plotting an attack similar to the November 2015 carnage in Paris that left 130 people dead.  Four months later, militants also struck in Brussels, hitting the airport and the metro, killing 32 people and leaving hundreds injured.  The killings rocked Belgium and caused consternation when it became clear that many of those involved had been known to the authorities for some time.  Several came from Molenbeek, home to a large Moroccan immigrant community, and had hidden there after the attacks before finally being tracked down by the police.",en,terrorattack,,

A six-year-old girl and her four-year-old brother died on Tuesday after becoming infected with the disease in a rural area on the Malaysian part of Borneo island.  They were among three people confirmed to have been infected with rabies, which in most cases is transmitted via dog bites, according to Sarawak's local government and housing minister Sim Kui Hian.  He said: ""Two of the three confirmed cases... were pronounced dead. They were diagnosed to be brain dead and the parents have agreed for life support to be withdrawn.""  Mr Sim added that the other patient was still ""critically ill"".  Malaysian director-general of health Noor Hisham Abdullah said the cases were the first rabies-related deaths in the country in almost 20 years.  Five villages in the Serian district of Sarawak state, which borders the Indonesian part of Borneo, were confirmed as having been affected by the outbreak.  Borneo is a big jungle-clad island that is shared between Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.  Mr Sim said health teams in Serian had visited 19 villages as of Tuesday and carried out checks on more than 6,000 people. Only three cases of humans contracting rabies have been confirmed.  Officials have ordered all dogs in the area to be vaccinated against rabies, reported state news agency Bernama.  Rabies causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, and is almost always fatal once contracted, according to the World Health Organisation. It said the disease affects mainly poor and vulnerable populations in rural areas.  AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE",en,diseas,,

Police yesterday raided a house in Cagayan de Oro city, two hours away from Marawi, and arrested three suspects found with ammunition and material for making bombs.  Among those detained was Monaliza Romato, who reportedly replaced her aunt, Ominta Maute, as ""matriarch"" of the group that attacked Marawi.  Maute's sons, Abdullah and Omarkhayam, formed that group. They led about 500 militants, including dozens from abroad, who stormed Marawi on May 23 in a bid to turn the city into a ""province"" of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group.  The militants have since held off an entire army brigade, keeping their hold on a small part of Marawi's commercial district.  ""(Monaliza) is providing financial and logistical support to the Maute terrorist group, and her house in Cagayan de Oro served as a sanctuary and transit point for Maute terrorist members,"" said Brigadier-General Restituto Padilla, the military spokesman.  A fourth suspect, Irene Idris, also a Maute relative, eluded arrest. She is said to be also a financier of the terrorist group.  Chief Inspector Mardy Hortillosa, a police spokesman, said the terrorist cell was planning to bomb targets in Cagayan de Oro to divert the military's attention away from Marawi.  Security officials said yesterday that they recovered the bodies of two ""foreign-looking"" militants in Marawi, including one suspected to be a Singaporean. They did not speculate on the nationality of the other gunman.  ""Initially they said... this could be the remains of a foreign fighter and allegedly a Singaporean,"" Brig-Gen Padilla said at a news briefing. ""But we don't yet have enough proof to validate this information, and we are working to do that along with the police.""  A senior officer with a joint task force supervising military operations in Marawi said: ""We will defer further details on that pending acquisition of more data.""  Two Vietnamese held hostage since last year by another ISIS-linked group, meanwhile, were found beheaded early yesterday in a remote village in Sumisip town in Basilan province.  Colonel Juvymax Uy, commander of Joint Task Force Basilan, said the bodies of Mr Hoang Trung Thong and Mr Hoang Va Hai were found at 5.40am in Tumahubong village. The two were among six crew members of the MV Royal 16, a Vietnamese cargo vessel, who were seized by the Abu Sayyaf group off Sibago Island in Basilan on Nov 11 last year.  Security forces rescued Mr Huang Vo, one of the MV Royal 16 hostages, last month.  Brig-Gen Padilla said the beheadings were an attempt by the Abu Sayyaf, which is allied with the ultra-radical ISIS, ""to cover up the fact that they are a spent force"".  The military last week reported that 258 Abu Sayyaf fighters had been ""subdued"" since January this year. Out of the total, 94 were killed, 66 were arrested and 98 surrendered, it said.",en,terrorattack,,

As they have after past retreats in the battle for the city, rival armed groups may fall back on using guerrilla tactics against Haftar's forces.  Haftar launched his ""Operation Dignity"" in Benghazi in May 2014, promising to crush Islamists blamed for a wave of assassinations and bombings.  Over three years his forces have clashed with militants as well as with former anti-Gaddafi rebels resisting what they saw as an attempt to reimpose autocratic rule. The LNA suffered heavy losses, which its own officials put at more than 5,000 men.  Haftar's critics accuse him of dragging Benghazi into a war that he has used to establish military control over much of eastern Libya.

Some buildings have been destroyed and others peppered with holes from bullets and shrapnel.  Having seized a string of key oil ports and southern air bases since last year, Haftar has made little secret of ambitions to enter Tripoli, where he portrays his rivals as beholden to Islamists and militia rule.  He has backing from foreign powers including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and has cultivated closer ties with Moscow.

REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares  CARACAS Pipe-wielding government supporters burst into Venezuela's opposition-controlled congress on Wednesday, witnesses said, attacking and besieging lawmakers in the latest flare-up of violence during a political crisis.  The melee, which injured seven opposition politicians, was another worrying flashpoint in a traumatic last three months for the South American OPEC nation, shaken by opposition protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  At least 90 people have died in the unrest, with fighting and barricades frequently blocking cities across Venezuela.  National Assembly president Julio Borges said more than 350 politicians, journalists and guests to the Independence Day session were trapped in the siege that lasted until dusk.  ""There are bullets, cars destroyed including mine, blood stains around the (congress) palace,"" he told reporters. ""The violence in Venezuela has a name and surname: Nicolas Maduro.""  The crowd had gathered just after dawn outside the building in downtown Caracas, chanting in favour of Maduro, witnesses said. In the late morning, several dozen people ran past the gates with pipes, sticks and stones and went on the attack.  Several injured lawmakers stumbled bloodied and dazed around the assembly's corridors. Some journalists were robbed.  After the morning attack, a crowd of roughly 100 people, many dressed in red and shouting ""Long Live The Revolution!"", trapped people inside for hours, witnesses said.  Some in the crowd outside the legislature brandished pistols, threatened to cut water and power supplies, and played an audio of former socialist president Hugo Chavez saying ""Tremble, oligarchy!"" Fireworks were thrown inside.  The worst-hurt lawmaker, Americo De Grazia, was hit on the head, fell unconscious, and was eventually taken by stretcher to an ambulance. His family later said he was out of critical condition and being stitched up.  Downtown Caracas is a traditional stronghold neighbourhood for the government and there has been a string of clashes there since the opposition thrashed the ruling Socialist Party in December 2015 parliamentary elections.  In a speech during a military parade for Independence Day, Maduro condemned the ""strange"" violence in the assembly and asked for an investigation. But he also challenged the opposition to speak out about violence from within its ranks.  In daily protests since April, young demonstrators have frequently attacked security forces with stones, homemade mortars and Molotov cocktails, and burned property. They killed one man by dousing him in gasoline and setting him on fire.  ""I want peace for Venezuela,"" Maduro said. ""I don't accept violence from anyone.""  FOREIGN CONDEMNATION  Numerous foreign nations repudiated Wednesday's events.  ""I condemn the grotesque attack on the Venezuelan assembly,"" tweeted UK ambassador John Saville.  ""This violence, perpetrated during the celebration of Venezuela's independence, is an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela's independence 206 years ago today,"" the U.S. State Department said.  Venezuela's opposition is demanding general elections to end socialist rule and solutions to the OPEC nation's brutal economic crisis. The government says its foes are seeking a violent coup with U.S. support.  Earlier, a Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in Caracas last week appeared in an internet video vowing to continue fighting.  ""Once again we are in Caracas, ready and willing to continue our struggle for the liberation of our country,"" police pilot Oscar Perez said in the video, wearing a military uniform and wool cap, with a Venezuelan flag and rifle behind him.  Perez had not been seen since he hijacked a helicopter last week and flew through Caracas pulling a ""Freedom"" banner. He opened fire and dropped grenades on the Interior Ministry and Supreme Court but nobody was injured.  Maduro, 54, the successor to Hugo Chavez, called that attack a terrorist assault to overthrow him and lambasted Western nations for not condemning it.  But many government critics doubt the official version, and some even suggested it may have been staged to divert attention from the country's economic and political crises.  In the video, Perez said the attack was ""perfectly achieved"" with no collateral damage ""because it was planned, because we are not murderers like you, Mr. Nicolas Maduro.""  Perez said he had staged an emergency landing on the Caribbean coast following the attack, and returned to the capital after hiking through mountains. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Perez, who has portrayed himself as a James Bond-cum-Rambo figure on social media, also is an actor who starred in a 2015 movie about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman.  Although he has claimed wider support within the security forces, Perez's actions so far appear to be a rogue stunt organised by a small group of disaffected policemen.  Venezuela's opposition says Maduro is seeking to consolidate control through a Constituent Assembly, a superbody that will be elected at the end of July. The opposition has promised to boycott the vote, which it says is rigged in favour of the ruling Socialist Party.  Before the attack on them, opposition lawmakers held a session denouncing the president as a ""dictator"" and approving a plebiscite that the opposition is organising for July 16, asking Venezuelans what they think of Maduro's plans.

Private First Class Hansen Kirkpatrick of Wasilla, Alaska, died on Monday when he was struck by Ã¢â‚¬Å“indirect fire,Ã¢â‚¬Â a military term that usually encompasses rockets, mortars, or artillery, the US military command in Kabul said in a statement. Kirkpatrick was assigned to the US ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1st Armored Division, which is based in Fort Bliss, Texas.

US and NATO coalition troops are deployed in Helmand to train and advise Afghan security forces struggling against Taliban insurgents. Some American units also conduct partnered operations, special operations raids, and provide air support. Overall, around 13,000 US and allied troops are deployed in Afghanistan.  Several thousand additional American forces operate as part of a separate counterterrorism mission in the country.  The Trump administration is considering adding several thousand troops, largely in a training and support capacity.

There have been 275,987 suspected cholera cases and 1,634 deaths from the illness between April 27 and July 5, the WHO said in a statement Wednesday. Children under the age of 15 make up 41% of these cases, and people older than 60 account for 33% of the deaths.  ""If you get caught early in the morning with this and you don't get treated by the end of the day, then you really have a problem,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said. ""A weak elderly person could really be dead by the end of the day.""  The WHO said in a statement last week, ""we are now facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world.""  Cholera is caused by ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria, which are spread through water or food that is contaminated with feces. Eighty percent of people with cholera don't have symptoms, but they are still capable of spreading it. Those who do show symptoms have a sudden onset of watery diarrhea, which can lead to death by severe dehydration. About 14.5 million people in Yemen don't have access to clean water and sanitation, according to the WHO.  All but two of the nation's governorates have been hit by the outbreak.  The WHO has partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund and local health authorities to deliver medication and aid to combat the ongoing outbreak, including the establishment of 45 diarrhea treatment centers and 236 oral rehydration therapy corners. Lindmeier said it is essential for people who are infected to rehydrate immediately.  ""The biggest challenge is reaching people,"" he said. ""This is great. This is a major effort and a huge logistical effort, but people need to know that they can get there. People need to know that they can find these places.""  Efforts have been complicated by Yemen's civil war, which has left more than 18.8 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the WHO. Many of the country's trained medical personnel have fled or been killed as the conflict intensified over the past two years, said Juliette Touma, UNICEF's regional chief of communications for the Middle East and North Africa.  Touma traveled to Yemen in early June to see what work was being done and said she was impressed by the dedication of health workers however, she couldn't help but think about all the people who still needed relief.  ""What I kept thinking about was all of these children who couldn't actually make it to medical care because they live in the remote parts of Yemen and the rural areas where there are no facilities, or those who couldn't afford to pay,"" Touma said.  Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.  Since the outbreak began, campaigns and community volunteers across the country have been trying to spread the message of how to prevent cholera, she said, including how to clean water, to wash food before eating it and to take general hygienic measures.  But Touma said there is a lot more to be done.  ""As long as we have more reports and suspected cases of cholera, and as long as the number of suspected cases increases -- and it has been increasing by the day -- we can't unfortunately say there has been progress,"" Touma said. ""There is a cure for cholera, we can cure it, and that is very much dependent on getting in essential supplies, but we need to get more. We need to get more dedicated personnel.""",en,diseas,,

Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar said the city now enters a new era of ""security, peace and reconciliation"".  If confirmed, victory would mark a major advance for the one-time commander in the army of late strongman Muammar Gaddafi.  The LNA is not recognised by Libya's UN-backed government in Tripoli.  Libya's unrest since the 2011 ousting of Gaddafi saw extremist organisations, including so-called Islamic State, gain a foothold in the country.  In a televised speech on Wednesday, Field Marshal Haftar said that ""after a continuous struggle against terrorism and its agents that lasted more than three years... we announce to you the liberation of Benghazi"".  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Khalifa Haftar has backing from some foreign powers  His announcement comes after bloody battles this week in Benghazi's Sabri district in which dozens of LNA fighters and various local Islamist militants died.  Pictures posted on social media sites showed some civilians in Benghazi and other parts of the country celebrating the end of a bitter conflict that left large parts of the country's second city in ruins and displaced thousands of people in recent years.  But Field Marshal Haftar also has many political and armed opponents in Libya.  He does not recognise the government in Tripoli, and instead backs the authorities in the east.  Opponents accuse the commander, who has backing from some foreign powers, of trying to impose autocratic rule in Libya.  Divided opinion - analysis by Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent  Benghazi's conflict over the last three years at times appeared to have no end in sight, and - as it grew - so too did the Field Marshal Haftar's political and military ambitions.  This is a significant gain for him, and a city that has been aching for respite from the war.  Opinions over the conflict in Benghazi are largely divided; many will be celebrating what they see as a war brought to their doorstep by Islamist militias at a time when political actors in Libya barely acknowledged there was a problem there, despite the near daily bombings and killings in the city.  Others view it as a product of a man who was power-hungry and lumped up all of his enemies under the banner of ""Islamist terrorists"" to pave the way for a future political role through the might of the gun.  His short address dedicated to the people of Libya had an unusually reconciliatory tone, but it is not one that will ease worries over what his, or his opponents' next move might be.  In Libya today, a military victory in one battlefield often opens the door to conflict in others.",en,terrorattack,,

If confirmed, Friday's killings in the northern city of Linz -- in which an 85-year-old woman's throat was slit and her 87-year-old husband was stabbed and beaten to death -- would be the first Islamist attack in Austria, which had so far avoided the jihadist assaults seen elsewhere in Europe.  The killings ""clearly had an Islamist background"", Sobotka told a press conference in Vienna, adding that the 54-year-old suspect, who handed himself in to police, ""is clearly a radicalised Muslim"".  The brutal nature of the killings had shocked Austrian media.  Police had said Tuesday that the murders did not initially appear to be an Islamist attack, with investigators focusing on the theory that the suspect harboured resentment against society as well as Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPOe).  He knew the victims, having regularly delivered their shopping from a shop run by his wife, and allegedly believed the elderly couple had links to the far-right.  But Sobotka told a press conference that the investigation had taken a turn after searches of the suspect's home and examination of his electronic data.  He declined to give further details on the evidence against the Tunisian, who has lived in Austria since 1989, or what he had said to investigators.  The Tunisian set fire to the couple's house before handing himself in to police, and remains in detention.  Chancellor Christian Kern urged an investigation ""without delay"" into the extremist threat to determine ""where similar risks exist and how to combat them efficiently"".  While Austria has until now been spared the major attacks that have hit other European countries including France, Britain and Germany, a relatively high number of Austrians have left to wage jihad abroad.  The interior ministry estimates that 300 have quit Austria or tried to leave in order to fight in Syria or Iraq -- a figure that is proportionately high in a population of 8.7 million.  There is no indication that the man suspected of murdering the elderly couple had travelled abroad to fight alongside extremist groups.  Most of those accused of jihadist links in Austria have been of Chechen or Bosnian origin.  Last year Austrian courts convicted 36 people of ""belonging to a terrorist group"", including Mirsad Omerovic, a jihadist of Bosnian origin considered the central figure in Austria's extremist scene.  Austrian authorities have poured more resources into anti-terror operations since 2014, with 14 people arrested in January raids in Vienna and second city Graz, accused of links to the Islamic State group.  The same month, authorities announced they had foiled an imminent attack, arresting an 18-year-old Austrian.  Austria is gearing up for legislative elections in October, which are being closely fought between the social democrats, conservatives and the far-right.",en,terrorattack,,

Pipe-wielding government supporters burst into Venezuela's opposition-controlled congress on Wednesday, witnesses said, attacking and besieging lawmakers in the latest flare-up of violence during a political crisis.  The melee, which injured seven opposition politicians, was another worrying flashpoint in a traumatic last three months for the South American OPEC nation, shaken by opposition protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  At least 90 people have died in the unrest, with fighting and barricades frequently blocking cities across Venezuela.  National Assembly president Julio Borges said more than 350 politicians, journalists and guests to the Independence Day session were trapped in the siege that lasted until dusk.  ""There are bullets, cars destroyed including mine, blood stains around the (congress) palace,"" he told reporters. ""The violence in Venezuela has a name and surname: Nicolas Maduro.""  The crowd had gathered just after dawn outside the building in downtown Caracas, chanting in favour of Maduro, witnesses said. In the late morning, several dozen people ran past the gates with pipes, sticks and stones and went on the attack.  Several injured lawmakers stumbled bloodied and dazed around the assembly's corridors. Some journalists were robbed.  After the morning attack, a crowd of roughly 100 people, many dressed in red and shouting ""Long Live The Revolution!"", trapped people inside for hours, witnesses said.  Some in the crowd outside the legislature brandished pistols, threatened to cut water and power supplies, and played an audio of former socialist president Hugo Chavez saying ""Tremble, oligarchy!""

Government supporters break a car outside the National Assembly, in Caracas, Venezuela July 5, 2017.  In a speech during a military parade for Independence Day, Maduro condemned the ""strange"" violence in the assembly and asked for an investigation. But he also challenged the opposition to speak out about violence from within its ranks.  In daily protests since April, young demonstrators have frequently attacked security forces with stones, homemade mortars and Molotov cocktails, and burned property. They killed one man by dousing him in gasoline and setting him on fire.  ""I want peace for Venezuela,"" Maduro said. ""I don't accept violence from anyone.""  FOREIGN CONDEMNATION  Numerous foreign nations repudiated Wednesday's events.  ""I condemn the grotesque attack on the Venezuelan assembly,"" tweeted UK ambassador John Saville.  ""This violence, perpetrated during the celebration of Venezuela's independence, is an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela's independence 206 years ago today,"" the US State Department said.  Venezuela's opposition is demanding general elections to end socialist rule and solutions to the OPEC nation's brutal economic crisis. The government says its foes are seeking a violent coup with US support.  Earlier, a Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in Caracas last week appeared in an internet video vowing to continue fighting.  ""Once again we are in Caracas, ready and willing to continue our struggle for the liberation of our country,"" police pilot Oscar Perez said in the video, wearing a military uniform and wool cap, with a Venezuelan flag and rifle behind him.  Perez had not been seen since he hijacked a helicopter last week and flew through Caracas pulling a ""Freedom"" banner. He opened fire and dropped grenades on the Interior Ministry and Supreme Court but nobody was injured.  Maduro, 54, the successor to Hugo Chavez, called that attack a terrorist assault to overthrow him and lambasted Western nations for not condemning it.  But many government critics doubt the official version, and some even suggested it may have been staged to divert attention from the country's economic and political crises.  In the video, Perez said the attack was ""perfectly achieved"" with no collateral damage ""because it was planned, because we are not murderers like you, Mr. Nicolas Maduro.""  Perez said he had staged an emergency landing on the Caribbean coast following the attack, and returned to the capital after hiking through mountains. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Perez, who has portrayed himself as a James Bond-cum-Rambo figure on social media, also is an actor who starred in a 2015 movie about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman.  Although he has claimed wider support within the security forces, Perez's actions so far appear to be a rogue stunt organised by a small group of disaffected policemen.  Venezuela's opposition says Maduro is seeking to consolidate control through a Constituent Assembly, a superbody that will be elected at the end of July. The opposition has promised to boycott the vote, which it says is rigged in favour of the ruling Socialist Party.

The images from Stratfor, a geopolitical intelligence platform, show a crater as well as flattened areas, the result of artillery and airstrikes carried by Philippine forces in an urban warfare that has so far killed more than 80 soldiers and police officers, as well as at least 40 civilians.

Jeknal AdilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death was only confirmed recently although it is understood that the 33-year-old was reportedly killed during a battle with Philippine military in Basilan, last July.  Jeknal assumed the nom de guerre Abu Shabah Al Muhajir when he joined the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), now an affiliation of IS, and was the first of two Malaysians to head to the terror groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stronghold in Basilan.  He and another wanted Malaysian, Amin Baco, from Sabah, who has since gone off radar, had left the country to join ASG in 2010.  Jeknal and Amin joined three other Malaysians, who fled the country in 2014, as soon as they came under the radars of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s counter-terrorism operatives.  They formed part of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Khatiba MuhajrinÃ¢â‚¬Â, which comprises fighters from Indonesia led by a former lecturer at the Universiti Malaya, Dr Mahmud Ahmad.  Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Division principal assistant director Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said intelligence gathered indicated that Jeknal was killed during an ambush by Philippine armed forces.  Jeknal, who was involved in terrorism at 18, had undergone at least five physical training sessions in Tawau, Sabah, where he embraced the ideology of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jihad QitalÃ¢â‚¬Â (Jihad through war).  He also received military training at an Abu Sayyaf camp on Jolo island between September 2005 and March 2006.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He was arrested on March 16, 2006, with another Indonesian militant, and was held under the now-defunct Internal Security Act at the Kamunting detention centre. He completed his restriction order on May 10, 2010, and made his way to southern Philippines about six months later,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mr Ayob said.  The New Straits Times was told that Jeknal escaped the police dragnet when he returned to Sabah to facilitate the relocation of AminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife and children to Mindanao.  Sources said Jeknal chose to leave his life in Sabah as he failed to obtain a Malaysian identification card.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Technically, although he is regarded as a Malaysian, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have citizenship. He was born in Sabah, but his father was a Filipino and his parents did not register his birth. Without an identification card, it will be difficult for him to get a job or get married, so he decided to leave.Ã¢â‚¬Â  It was understood that Jeknal was part of an insurgent group that took part in several clashes with Philippine military in Jolo, Basilan and Mindanao in periods preceding his death.  His death was narrated in detail by IS propaganda magazine Rumiyah, released last month.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Abu ShabahÃ¢â‚¬Â was preparing breakfast for members of his camp when he heard the sound of heavy artillery headed their way, the report read.  He was hit by shelling from the military assault.  The fate of Mahmud, who is believed to be part of the IS-linked Maute group battling the Philippine military in Marawi City, is still unknown.  While some reports said he was killed in the earlier days of the siege, which began on May 23, Malaysian authorities believe he is alive.  MahmudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right-hand man, Malaysian bomb expert Mohd Najib Husen died in 2015 during a shoot-out with the military.

The ongoing search follows the discovery of a stash of weapons in a Brussels suburb, including Kalashnikov assault rifles, smaller firearms, ammunition, bullet proof vests, detonators, a blue police beacon and security and police uniforms.  The items found in a lock-up garage sparked concern that potential attackers could have been plotting to pose as police and other officials.  It is also feared the discovery of the store, which followed the search of six properties, could provoke an attack similar to the bombings in the Belgian capital last year.  The attack on an airport and a metro station on 22 March, 2016, which killed 32 and injured more than 300, occurred after police uncovered a weapons cache as they hunted an Islamic State cell linked to attacks in Paris the year before.

Last year, Said was jailed for recruiting people to jihadist organisations and supporting IS on social media.

A fifth man, reportedly suspected of planning a ""violent attack"", was arrested across the border in northern France, close to the city of Lille.  Belgian and French police co-operated on the joint investigation, with prosecutors saying the raids were ""directly linked"" to members of the Kamikaze Riders and not part of the investigation into the Brussels and Paris attacks.  France remains in a state of emergency following the November 2015 attack in the French capital, which killed 130.
