MANILA: Philippine security forces arrested on Wednesday the main financier and logistics supporter of the pro-Islamic State militants who have for weeks been battling government troops for control of a southern town, the army said.  The militants from a faction known as the Maute group, seized the town or Marawi on May 23 and are resisting daily assaults by government forces using aircraft and artillery, and with help from allies the United States and Australia.  The fighting in the largely Muslim town in south of the predominantly Christian Philippines has alarmed neighbours, fearful that Islamic State is bent on gaining a foothold in the region as it loses ground in the Middle East.  Security forces raided a village not far from Marawi and detained three suspects found with ammunition and material for making bombs, an army spokesman, Brigadier-General Gilbert Gapay, said.  One of those detained was an important supporter of the Maute group who Gapay identified as Monaliza Romato, alias Monay.  The woman is a niece of the matriarch of the Maute clan, whose men-folk lead the Marawi attack. Two of seven Maute brothers, Omar and Abdullah, were educated in the Middle East, and were the main planners of the assault on Marawi, the military has said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""Monay has replaced her aunt as the main financier and logistic supporter of the militant group,"" Gapay said in a statement.  ""The arrest will adversely affect the logistics support network of the group,"" he said.  The raid, seizure of weapons and the arrests would also prevent the militants from mounting diversionary attacks, he said.  REPLENISHING WEAPONS  More than 400 people have been killed in the fighting in Marawi. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and about 20 percent of the centre of the town has been destroyed.  On Wednesday, military aircraft dropped bombs on the town while ground forces tried to advance from house to house.  President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law on Mindanao island, where Marawi is located, for 60 days when the fighting erupted and Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said there was pressure on the military to defeat the militants before it expires on July 23.  That is also a day before Duterte is due to deliver his annual state of the nation address in Congress.  Lorenzana said the military last week sent an aircraft to the United States to stock up on various bombs and rockets, supplies of which were running out.  U.S. forces are providing Philippine troops with technical assistance for the battle while Australia has sent two surveillance planes.  In another part of Mindanao, soldiers on Tuesday found the beheaded bodies of two Vietnamese sailors abducted a year ago by militants from the Abu Sayyaf group.  Three Vietnamese sailors are still being held by Abu Sayyaf, who, in all, hold 14 foreigners and eight Philippine citizens.  Vietnam denounced the killing of its citizens.  ""Vietnam strongly condemns all savage and inhumane kidnapping and murderous acts and believes that these acts must be punished properly,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters.  The Abu Sayyaf militants are allied with the Maute group.  The fighting in Marawi erupted on May 23 when security forces tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf leader who the government believes is Islamic State's ""emir"", or leader, in the Philippines, and who was in the town with Maute fighters at the time.  Lorenzana said this week Hapilon is believed to be hiding in a Marawi mosque.  (Reporting by Manuel Mogato and Karen Lema; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel)",en,terrorattack,,
318000,thestar,None,Somali militants kill three police in raid on Kenyan border town - World,http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2017/07/05/somali-militants-kill-two-police-during-extended-raid-on-kenyan-town/,5/7/2017 0:00,6/7/2017 0:32,"MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Somali al Shabaab militants killed three police officers on Wednesday during a raid on a northeastern Kenyan town that sparked a day-long gunbattle, a senior police official said.  It was the latest in a spate of attacks on Kenyan security services since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to join a African Union force charged with neutralising militant and other armed groups and bolstering its U.N.-backed government.  Al Shabaab gunmen attacked the police station in the town of Pandanguo in the coastal district of Lamu around 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), forcing villagers to flee, according to residents. The area is near Kenya's long, porous border with Somalia.  The militants also raided a dispensary for drugs and houses for food items, clothes and other valuables, witnesses said. Smoke could be seen rising from the village later in the day.  By 6 p.m., three policemen had been killed and a gunbattle was continuing, police said.  ""The attackers used RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),"" George Kinoti, Kenya's national police spokesman, said in a text message. ""Reinforcements sent to engage the enemy have killed several terrorists.""  In July 2014, more than 60 militants attacked the same village, torched houses and stole drugs at the same dispensary.  Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, confirmed Wednesday's attack to Reuters by phone.  ""We burned the police station and captured cars. Now, today, there are sporadic exchanges of gunfire between us and the police in the outskirts of the town but we still control the town,"" he said.  The raid follows a series of attacks in Kenya claimed by Somali militants that have killed at least 28 people in the last six weeks. Most have taken place near the Somali border.  The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militia is fighting to overthrow Somalia's weak, U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law in the Horn of Africa state.  They ramped up attacks in neighbouring Kenya after Kenyan troops entered Somalia to join the AU peacekeeping force there.  In a separate incident in Somalia, an air strike killed 10 al Shabaab militants near the southern port city of Kismayo, the Mogadishu government said. It was not immediately clear who carried out the air strike.  Somalia's government does not have aircraft but mentioned ""international partners"" in its press statement. Ethiopia, Kenya and the United States have all conducted air raids on Somali territory.

They said on Wednesday two men had been arrested and charged with belonging to a terrorist organisation. ""We are still looking for additional people,"" a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor said.  Belgium, which hosts European Union and NATO headquarters, has been prominent in the fight against radical Islamists since finding that those who killed 130 people in bombing and shooting attacks in Paris in November 2015 had plotted them in Brussels.  The Belgian capital itself was hit by suicide bombings in March 2016 that killed 32 people.  The two men arrested this week had no links with the groups that carried out the previous attacks, however, prosecutors said, suggesting they may be part of a separate militant cell.  Prosecutors also said they had no information to back up reports in Belgian media on Thursday that authorities feared an imminent attack in the country.  ""We can never exclude that one of those guys gets into a car and does something stupid. But do we have any concrete evidence that this is going to happen? No!"" the spokesman said.  Belgian is currently at level three on a four-tier security threat scale.  (Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Alissa de Carbonnel and Mark Heinrich)",en,terrorattack,,
