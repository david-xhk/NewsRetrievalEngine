MANILA: Philippine security forces arrested on Wednesday the main financier and logistics supporter of the pro-Islamic State militants who have for weeks been battling government troops for control of a southern town, the army said.  The militants from a faction known as the Maute group, seized the town or Marawi on May 23 and are resisting daily assaults by government forces using aircraft and artillery, and with help from allies the United States and Australia.  The fighting in the largely Muslim town in south of the predominantly Christian Philippines has alarmed neighbours, fearful that Islamic State is bent on gaining a foothold in the region as it loses ground in the Middle East.  Security forces raided a village not far from Marawi and detained three suspects found with ammunition and material for making bombs, an army spokesman, Brigadier-General Gilbert Gapay, said.  One of those detained was an important supporter of the Maute group who Gapay identified as Monaliza Romato, alias Monay.  The woman is a niece of the matriarch of the Maute clan, whose men-folk lead the Marawi attack. Two of seven Maute brothers, Omar and Abdullah, were educated in the Middle East, and were the main planners of the assault on Marawi, the military has said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""Monay has replaced her aunt as the main financier and logistic supporter of the militant group,"" Gapay said in a statement.  ""The arrest will adversely affect the logistics support network of the group,"" he said.  The raid, seizure of weapons and the arrests would also prevent the militants from mounting diversionary attacks, he said.  REPLENISHING WEAPONS  More than 400 people have been killed in the fighting in Marawi. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and about 20 percent of the centre of the town has been destroyed.  On Wednesday, military aircraft dropped bombs on the town while ground forces tried to advance from house to house.  President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law on Mindanao island, where Marawi is located, for 60 days when the fighting erupted and Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said there was pressure on the military to defeat the militants before it expires on July 23.  That is also a day before Duterte is due to deliver his annual state of the nation address in Congress.  Lorenzana said the military last week sent an aircraft to the United States to stock up on various bombs and rockets, supplies of which were running out.  U.S. forces are providing Philippine troops with technical assistance for the battle while Australia has sent two surveillance planes.  In another part of Mindanao, soldiers on Tuesday found the beheaded bodies of two Vietnamese sailors abducted a year ago by militants from the Abu Sayyaf group.  Three Vietnamese sailors are still being held by Abu Sayyaf, who, in all, hold 14 foreigners and eight Philippine citizens.  Vietnam denounced the killing of its citizens.  ""Vietnam strongly condemns all savage and inhumane kidnapping and murderous acts and believes that these acts must be punished properly,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters.  The Abu Sayyaf militants are allied with the Maute group.  The fighting in Marawi erupted on May 23 when security forces tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf leader who the government believes is Islamic State's ""emir"", or leader, in the Philippines, and who was in the town with Maute fighters at the time.  Lorenzana said this week Hapilon is believed to be hiding in a Marawi mosque.  (Reporting by Manuel Mogato and Karen Lema; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel)",en,terrorattack,,

It was the latest in a spate of attacks on Kenyan security services since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to join a African Union force charged with neutralising militant and other armed groups and bolstering its U.N.-backed government.  Al Shabaab gunmen attacked the police station in the town of Pandanguo in the coastal district of Lamu around 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), forcing villagers to flee, according to residents. The area is near Kenya's long, porous border with Somalia.  The militants also raided a dispensary for drugs and houses for food items, clothes and other valuables, witnesses said. Smoke could be seen rising from the village later in the day.  By 6 p.m., three policemen had been killed and a gunbattle was continuing, police said.  ""The attackers used RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),"" George Kinoti, Kenya's national police spokesman, said in a text message. ""Reinforcements sent to engage the enemy have killed several terrorists.""  In July 2014, more than 60 militants attacked the same village, torched houses and stole drugs at the same dispensary.  Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, confirmed Wednesday's attack to Reuters by phone.  ""We burned the police station and captured cars. Now, today, there are sporadic exchanges of gunfire between us and the police in the outskirts of the town but we still control the town,"" he said.  The raid follows a series of attacks in Kenya claimed by Somali militants that have killed at least 28 people in the last six weeks. Most have taken place near the Somali border.  The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militia is fighting to overthrow Somalia's weak, U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law in the Horn of Africa state.  They ramped up attacks in neighbouring Kenya after Kenyan troops entered Somalia to join the AU peacekeeping force there.  In a separate incident in Somalia, an air strike killed 10 al Shabaab militants near the southern port city of Kismayo, the Mogadishu government said. It was not immediately clear who carried out the air strike.  Somalia's government does not have aircraft but mentioned ""international partners"" in its press statement. Ethiopia, Kenya and the United States have all conducted air raids on Somali territory.

Belgium, which hosts European Union and NATO headquarters, has been prominent in the fight against radical Islamists since finding that those who killed 130 people in bombing and shooting attacks in Paris in November 2015 had plotted them in Brussels.  The Belgian capital itself was hit by suicide bombings in March 2016 that killed 32 people.  The two men arrested this week had no links with the groups that carried out the previous attacks, however, prosecutors said, suggesting they may be part of a separate militant cell.  Prosecutors also said they had no information to back up reports in Belgian media on Thursday that authorities feared an imminent attack in the country.  ""We can never exclude that one of those guys gets into a car and does something stupid. But do we have any concrete evidence that this is going to happen? No!"" the spokesman said.

337680,foxnews,Aya Batrawy,Qatar crisis raises questions about defining terrorism,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/UvrNI2frjm8/qatar-crisis-raises-questions-about-defining-terrorism.html,,7/7/2017 16:33,"A diplomatic standoff between Qatar and four other Arab nations that accuse it of sponsoring terrorism has turned a spotlight on an opaque network of charities and prominent figures freely operating in the tiny Gulf country.  It also raises questions about what constitutes a ""terrorist"" in the Middle East.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain have released a list of two dozen groups and nearly 60 individuals that they allege have been involved in financing terrorism and are linked to Qatar.  Qatar insists it condemns terrorism and that it does not support extremist groups.  The crisis began last month when the four Arab countries cut ties to Qatar. They demanded it end the alleged support of terrorism, and also that it cut its relations with Shiite power Iran and stop meddling in their affairs through support of Islamist opposition groups.  The energy rich nation is an important U.S. ally in a volatile region. It hosts about 10,000 U.S. troops at an air base used to launch coalition airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq.  The list of the groups and individuals released by Qatar's neighbors reflects longstanding concerns raised by U.S. officials. At the same time, it also includes political dissenters and opposition voices.  ""The allegation that Qatar supports terrorism was clearly designed to generate anti-Qatar sentiment in the West,"" Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Wednesday in a speech in London.  As he spoke, foreign ministers from the Arab quartet met in Cairo to review Qatar's response to their demands. At the top of those demands is that Qatar end support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which briefly held power in Egypt and whose offshoots are active across the Middle East.  Though Qatar has cracked down on dissent at home, it views the Brotherhood as a legitimate political force. This has put it at odds with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, which have branded the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and see it as a threat to political stability and security.  In his speech, Al Thani said there is a danger in ""labeling political opponents as terrorists merely to silence them.""  ""Our neighbors see change Ã¢â‚¬â€ those advocating for it and those reporting on it Ã¢â‚¬â€ as a threat, and they are quick to label anyone who opposes their governments as a 'terrorist,'"" he said.  The Brotherhood's spiritual guide, Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi, was among those accused by Qatar's neighbors of having ties with terrorism. The 90-year-old Egyptian cleric, who has lived in Qatar for decades, previously was embraced by Gulf leaders and was seen alongside Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdelaziz Al Sheikh, and the UAE's rulers.  In 2013, he joined a chorus of preachers in the Gulf urging young men to defend Sunni Muslims in Syria, calls that coincided with official backing of rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad.  Al-Qaradawi differed from other Gulf preachers in that he strongly criticized Egypt's government when it ousted the Brotherhood from power. He also was critical of Gulf countries that backed the lethal crackdown.  Qatar's support of the Brotherhood has made it an outlier, as has its unique role as a mediator in hostage negotiations, helping to free Western captives held by al-Qaida in Syria and Yemen.  Christopher Mellon, a researcher with the New America Foundation who co-authored a report about ransom payments, said these negotiations have often involved paying extremist groups. He said European governments have similarly gone to extreme lengths to keep these transactions private.  ""They're very deliberately nontransparent. They don't want anyone to know that they've paid,"" he said.  Reports emerged earlier this year that Qatar paid hundreds of millions of dollars to release members of its ruling family who were kidnapped in Iraq. Allegations were raised that the complex deal included Qatari payments to an al-Qaida-linked group in Syria, as well as to an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq.  Qatar said reports of ransom payments to these groups are false and that it provided Iraq's government with financial aid to support the release of the Qataris.  The Arab quartet's list names a number of Qatari nationals, including Khalifa al-Subaie, Saad bin Saad al-Kabi, Abdelrahman al-Nuaymi, Ibrahim al-Bakr and Abdel-Latif al-Kuwari. All have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department as material supporters of al-Qaida. The five appear to be living in Qatar Ã¢â‚¬â€ their assets are frozen, they are under surveillance and are barred from traveling abroad Ã¢â‚¬â€ but they are not imprisoned.  The U.S. Treasury said al-Bakr was detained in Qatar in the early 2000s for his role in a jihadist network but that he was released from prison after promising not to conduct terrorist activity in Qatar. Treasury alleged that in 2006, he played a key role in a terrorist cell plotting to attack U.S. military bases in Qatar, and as of mid-2012 was serving as a link between Gulf-based al-Qaida financiers and Afghanistan.  While some of those sanctioned by the U.S. have faced trial and may have been detained by Qatar at some point, there does not appear to be a single individual jailed in Qatar for terrorism financing, according to David Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.  Weinberg, who has written extensively about terror financing in the Gulf, said Qatar has been ""inexcusably negligent"" when it comes to cracking down on such financiers.  ""There's been a longstanding debate within the U.S. government about whether Qatar's lax enforcement is related to lack of capability or lack of will. My research leads me to believe it's the latter: lack of will,"" he said.  The Associated Press asked Qatari officials Wednesday for information on the prosecution of individuals suspected of terrorism financing. The officials said they would look into the request but had not provided details by Thursday evening.  Also on the list is Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalid Al Thani, a senior member of Qatar's royal family and a former interior minister. The quartet accused him of giving shelter to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in the 1990s as he actively funded al-Qaida operations abroad, but before he became the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.  The allegations leveled against Qatar cut both ways.  In the U.K. this week, a right wing think tank released a study alleging Saudi Arabia has spent 67 billion pounds (nearly $87 billion) to export its austere Wahhabi interpretation of Islam around the world. The report by the Henry Jackson Foundation has increased pressure on the British government to make public a study on Saudi Arabia's role in inciting extremism in Britain.  The quartet list also names Kuwaiti national Hajjaj al-Ajmi, who is sanctioned by the U.S. for allegedly raising funds that led to the procurement of weapons for al-Qaida-linked fighters in Syria. The UAE and its allies say he raised some of that money through a Qatar-based fundraising campaign, but he appears to be living in Kuwait.  ___  Follow Aya Batrawy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ayaelb",en,terrorattack,,

At least ten Egyptian soldiers including a colonel were killed in a suicide bomb attack on an army checkpoint in northern Sinai, security sources said.  Another 40 fighters were killed in a subsequent gun battle with soldiers at the checkpoint, an army spokesperson said on Friday.  The attack started when a suicide car bomber rammed his vehicle into the checkpoint at a military compound in the southern Rafah village of el-Barth, followed by heavy gunfire from dozens of masked fighters on foot, officials said.  The dead included a high ranking special forces officer, Colonel Ahmed el-Mansi, and at least 20 others were wounded in the attack.  Sirens of ambulances were heard from a distance as they rushed to the site of the attack.  The officials spoke to AP news agency on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorised to speak to the media.  No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.  Speaking to Al Jazeera from Bologna, Spain, Timothy Kaldas, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said there was a high likelihood that the attack would be claimed by Wilayat Sinai, a group affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group.  The group frequently targets military and police personnel, he said, adding that Friday's attack was ""unfortunately a very predictable type of attack and something we've seen regularly"".  Over the past months, ISIL has focused its attacks on Egypt's Christian minority and carried out at least four deadly attacks that killed dozens, prompting army chief-turned-President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi to declare a state of emergency in the country.  The Sinai branch of ISIL appears to be the most resilient outside Syria and Iraq, where the so-called caliphate is witnessing its demise.  The group's offshoot in Libya has been uprooted in months-long battles in the central city of Sirte while its branch in Yemen has failed to seize territories or compete with its al-Qaeda rivals.

Militants are waging an insurgency in the rugged, thinly populated Sinai Peninsula and have killed hundreds of soldiers and police since 2013, when the military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule.  The Sinai militants pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014 and adopted the name Sinai Province.  The two cars blew up as they passed through two checkpoints close to each other on a road outside Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip, the security sources said. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks.  The security sources said another 26 soldiers were injured in Friday's attacks. The military put the casualties lower, and said the attacks had killed and injured a total of 26 soldiers, but did not provide a breakdown of the figure.  Within hours of the bombings security forces carried out a counter-attack and killed 40 militants suspected of involvement in the suicide bombings and destroyed six of their vehicles, according to a military statement.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The military posted photos of five dead militants in blood-soaked fatigues lying in the sand. It did not name the militants' suspected affiliation.  ""Law enforcement forces in North Sinai succeeded in thwarting a terrorist attack on some checkpoints south of Rafah,"" a military statement said.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi describes Islamist militancy as an existential threat to Egypt. Attacks have increasingly shifted beyond the Sinai deep into Egypt's heartland, often targeting minority Coptic Christians.  Separately on Friday, a homeland security officer was shot dead outside his home in Qalubiya, a province just north of Cairo, while on his way to Friday prayers, an Interior Ministry statement said.  Responding to the Sinai attack, Prime Minister Sherif Ismail stressed the need for countries to unite against those who support terrorism and to ""dry up their sources of funding,"" an allusion to Qatar.  Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain broke diplomatic relations with Qatar last month and are now boycotting the Gulf Arab state, which they accuse of supporting terrorism and allying with regional foe Iran.

""They occupy high-rise buildings so we have to be higher. So we use air strikes.""  While hundreds of fighters rampaged through much of Marawi in the early days of the siege, Herrera said there were now around 80 gunmen still active in the ""main battle area"" comprising around 800 buildings.  ""These are the tall buildings. This was the centre of commerce of Marawi City,"" he explained.  However the buildings also needed to be cleared of improvised bombs and other booby-traps as the troops advance, he said.  There are also about 300 civilians trapped in the area, Herrera said, adding that some were being used as hostages, bearers of supplies and even being forced to help in looting the city.  President Rodrigo Duterte last month vowed to ""crush"" the militants, but several deadlines have already been missed to end a conflict that has forced almost 400,000 people from their homes.  The fighting has reduced Marawi, considered the Muslim capital of the largely Catholic Philippines, to a ruined ghost town. It also prompted Duterte to declare martial law over the entire southern Philippines.  Herrera said 366 enemy fighters, 39 civilians and 87 government troops had been killed in the fighting so far.",en,terrorattack,,

The battle has left large parts of Mosul in ruins, killed thousands of civilians and displaced nearly one million people.  ""The commander in chief of the armed forces (Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi arrived in the liberated city of Mosul and congratulated the heroic fighters and Iraqi people for the great victory,"" his office said in a statement.  The decaying corpses of militants lay in the narrow streets of the Old City where Islamic State has staged a last stand against Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition.  The group vowed to ""fight to the death"" in Mosul, but Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told state TV earlier on Sunday that 30 militants had been killed attempting to escape by swimming across the River Tigris that bisects the city.  Cornered in a shrinking area, the militants have resorted to sending women suicide bombers among the thousands of civilians who are emerging from the battlefield wounded, malnourished and fearful.  The battle has also exacted a heavy toll on Iraq's security forces.  The Iraqi government does not reveal casualty figures, but a funding request from the U.S. Department of Defense said the elite Counter Terrorism Service, which has spearheaded the fight in Mosul, had suffered 40 percent losses.  The United States leads an international coalition that is backing the campaign against Islamic State in Mosul by conducting airstrikes against the militants and assisting troops on the ground.  The Department of Defense has requested $1.269 billion in U.S. budget funds for 2018 to continue supporting Iraqi forces.  Without Mosul - by far the largest city to fall under militant control - Islamic State's dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city where tens of thousands of people live.  It is almost exactly three years since the ultra-hardline group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a ""caliphate"" spanning Syria and Iraq from the pulpit of the medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque.  Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's ""state of falsehood"" a week ago, after security forces retook the mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up.  The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said.  The militants are expected to revert to insurgent tactics as they lose territory.  The fall of Mosul also exposes ethnic and sectarian fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories or between Sunnis and the ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite majority that have plagued Iraq for more than a decade.

The group has already shifted back to its roots as an insurgent force, but one that now has an international reach and an ideology that continues to motivate attackers around the world.  Yesterday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi claimed victory over ISIS in Mosul after nearly nine months of fighting. A coalition force is also fighting to drive ISIS out of its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa.  ""These are obviously major blows to ISIS because its state-building project is over, there is no more caliphate, and that will diminish support and recruits,"" said senior fellow Hassan Hassan at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington who has co-authored a book on the terror group.  ""But ISIS today is an international organisation. Its leadership and its ability to grow back are still there.""  ISIS has overshadowed its militant precursors like Al-Qaeda by not just holding territory, but also running cities and their hinterlands for an extended period, winning the group credibility in the militant world and allowing it to build a complex organisation.  So even while its physical hold slips, its surviving cadres - middle managers, weapons technicians, propagandists and other operatives - will invest that experience in the group's future operations.  And even though its hold on crucial urban centres is being shaken, ISIS is in no way homeless yet.  Related Story Iraqi PM hails 'victory' in Mosul as militants flee  Related Story Exhausted and grieving, families emerge from city's ruins  In Iraq, the group still controls Tal Afar, Hawija, other towns and much of Anbar province.  In Syria, most of its top operatives have fled Raqqa in the past six months for other towns still under ISIS control in the Euphrates River valley, said US and Western military and counter-terrorism officials.  Many have moved to Mayadeen, a town 175km south-east of Raqqa near oil facilities and with supply lines through the desert. They have taken with them the group's most important recruiting, financing, propaganda and external operations functions, said US officials.  The caliphate also lives on in the virtual realm, as its operatives and supporters churn out propaganda, bomb manuals, encryption guides and advice on how to kill the largest number of people with trucks.  US officials acknowledged the difficulty of fighting the group online.  ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" said US Homeland Security and counter-terrorism adviser Thomas Bossert on ABC's This Week television programme on July 2.  Still, many Syrians and Iraqis whose lives the militants have ravaged are glad to see them chased out, despite worries over the future.  ""I am happy that Daesh is dying, but the fear of what might come next is killing this happiness,"" said Raqqa native Ahmed Abdul-Qadir, who was running an anti-militant media group in Turkey when gunmen he believes belonged to ISIS shot him in the jaw.  ""It makes me wish that this whole organisation would vanish and that no one who believes in its doctrine would remain alive,"" he said.  NYTIMES",en,terrorattack,1,"['Iraq', 'Mosul']"

There is terrorism that requires more thoughtful action,' says Supreme Court Associate Justice Marvic Leonen  Published 4:00 PM, July 09, 2017  MANILA, Philippines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Supreme Court (SC) Associate Justice Marvic Leonen believes that the violence sowed by the Maute terror group in Marawi City was exaggerated by the government, calling the official narrative ""far-fetched, when it could be nothing but fake news.""  Leonen, before being appointed to the SC, was the chief peace negotiator for the Aquino administration which brokered the peace deal between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), seen then as key to finally end decades of conflict in Mindanao.  According to Leonen, the SC should have given weight to the cultural context in Mindanao which he believes proves that the crisis in Marawi City is not a case of rebellion. He was outvoted 11-3-1 as the SC upheld the constitutionality of martial law in Mindanao, with the 3 justices voting to restrict it to only certain areas in the region.  ""Blindly accepting a possibly far-fetched narrative of what transpired in Marawi leading up to and including the events of May 23, 2017 and ignoring the cultural context will have its own consequences. The public will accept this far-fetched narrative as reasonable or the truth, when it could be nothing but fake news,"" he wrote in his dissenting opinion.  Leonen added: ""The government may be inadvertently doing a service for Maute Group and ISIS projecting them as bigger than what they really are.""  Cultural context  In his dissenting opinion, Leonen explained the historical and ideological contexts of the 4 terror groups which the military said had joined forces to establish an ISIS caliphate in the region. (READ: ISIS to declare a province in Mindanao?)  They are the Maute terror group, Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) Basilan, Ansar Khalifa Philippines (AKP) and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF).  ""Individually, these groups have undergone splits and are fragmented into different factions. Their stability and solidarity is unclear,"" he said.  Leonen added that the government's reliance on the ISIS newsletter, Al Naba, which supposedly indicates the linkages of the 4 group, may be misguided.  ""It is a propaganda material, which provides skewed information designed to influence opinion,"" he said. (READ: Terror in Mindanao: The Mautes of Marawi)  He said there is also a significant ideological conflict which makes it hard to believe that the terrorists' intent in Marawi City is to overthrow the government.  For example, Leonen said, the Radullan Sahiron ASG faction does not trust foreign fighters, while Isnilon Hapilon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ supposed to be ISIS' designated emir in the Philippines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ""liked anything that smelled foreign, especially anything from the Middle East."" Military confirmed that the Maute-ASG forces in Marawi City include foreign fighters.  BIFF, on the other hand, is a group which broke away from the MILF led then by Umbra Kato. The associate justice said that even the BIFF has its own breakaway group, a faction led by Kumander Kagi Karialan who disagreed with the BIFF leadership's decision to align with the Maute group.  As for the AKP, he said ""the stability of the group is presently unclear due to the death of Tokboy on January 5, 2017.""  ""The ideological divergence within the ASG and the BIFF as well as the vacuum in the leadership of the AKP creates serious doubt on the strength of their entire group's allegiance to the ISIS and their alleged ties with each other,"" the dissenting opinion read. (READ: Why solidarity with Mindanao requires opposing martial law)  ISIS ideology  Citing research papers and in-depth reports on ISIS, Leonen called the ISIS ideology ""fundamentally nihilistic and apocalyptic.""  ""ISIS ideology, as salafi-jihadis, is fundamentally nihilistic and apocalyptic, and if properly lived by its alleged adherents, it would naturally alienate the Muslim population in many areas in Mindanao,"" he said.  There is something amiss with this and Hapilon's association with them, according to Leonen.  ""They are therefore relentlessly Koranic. However, Hapilon was not even a fluent speaker of Arabic at the time he was supposedly recognized as emir of ISIS forces in the Philippines. His religious knowledge was likewise reported to be limited. His allegiance to ISIS is conjectured to be motivated by his desire to be part of a Middle Eastern organization, as he 'has always liked anything that smelled foreign, especially anything from the Middle East',"" he said.  In his defense of the government, Solicitor General Jose Calida told the SC Hapilon performed a symbolic hijra or pilgrimage to unite with other ISIS-inspired groups in mainland Mindanao.  For Leonen, Calida was not able to sufficiently explain what a hijra means and whether it proves the government stance that a rebellion is occurring in Marawi City.  ""Rather, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) source states that, in relation to hijrah, ISIS ""calls on Muslims to migrate to Syria,"" which is the opposite of establishing an ISIS-recognized Islamic Province in the Philippines. Indeed, it appears that ISIS expressly focuses on bringing fighters to Syria,"" the opinion read.  ""Using Arabic words like hijra without any attempt to explain it and naming it an overt act of establishing an Islamic province within the Philippines creates unnecessary ambiguity when what is needed is clarity. It is an act of othering and discourages even the attempt to understand,"" he said.  The Associate Justice thus wished these nuances were taken into consideration when the SC made its ruling.  ""Even assuming that the facts alleged to have occurred on May 23, 20I7 are true, these facts may have been linked together, ignoring the cultural context, to create a false narrative by the storyteller,"" Leonen said.  The military earlier said the terror groups in Marawi City are not ISIS, but eventually said they are, which aligned with the statements of President Rodrigo Duterte. Later on, military chief General Eduardo AÃƒÂ±o told the SC denying ISIS links was just part of their psychological operations.  Terrorists of 'low-level' discipline  Leonen made it clear that the terror acts in Marawi City are not to be taken lightly, but for him, martial law is not the answer.  For him, the military has proven it ""can quell violence, disrupt many of the planned atrocities that may yet to come"" even when they did not resort to martial law.  He pointed out that the culprits of Marawi siege are the same people who already have pending warrants of arrest for the commission of common crimes.  Leonen cited the military's own report which said the ASG is ""incapable of sustaining prolonged armed confrontation in view of its limited supply of ammunition and firearms.""  There is also infighting among the terrorists, as they have ""a low level of discipline"" and are prone to ""insubordination and infighting brought about by envy and personal differences within the group.""  ""Clearly, they are capable of isolated atrocities. However, to the extent that they can sustain a rebellion threatening even the existence of any local government is a difficult conclusion to believe,"" Leonen said.  ""In other words, even before the Marawi hostilities, law enforcers, including the armed forces were already degrading their capability,"" the associate justice added.  Don't call them rebels  ""The terrorists responsible for the armed hostilities in Marawi cannot be considered rebels. It is true that they may have discussed the possibility of a caliphate. Yet, from all the evidence presented, they are incapable of actually holding territory long enough to govern,"" Leonen said.  Leonen's dissenting opinion also appears to give a nudge to the Moro liberation fronts, also called as rebel groups, which have opened its doors to the government in peace process attempts over the years.  MILF is now the government's partner in trying to establish a Bangsamoro political entity, while the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) has engaged with the Duterte administration.  ""I honor the sacrifices of many by calling our enemy with their proper names: terrorists capable of committing atrocious acts. They are not rebels desirous of a viable political alternative that can be accepted by any of our societies,"" he said.  Leonen advised the government to act more thoughtfully. (READ: Duterte accepts Misuari's offer of MNLF fighters vs Maute)  ""The extremist views of religious fanatics will never take hold in our communities for so long as they enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by our constitution. There will be no radicals for so long as our government is open and tolerant of the activism of others who demand a more egalitarian, tolerant and socially just society,"" he said.  In his opinion's closing statements, Leonen hits the martial law proclamation as apparent authoritarianism which may just add to the flames of terrorism.  ""The terrorist wins when we suspend all that we believe in. The terrorist wins when we replace social justice with disempowering authoritarianism,"" he said.  Finally, he said terrorists cannot be ""found and kept in check by a false sense of security created by the narrative of martial law."" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,,

Gunfire and explosions could be heard as the U.S.-led coalition pounded the remaining few Islamic State positions.  ""They won't declare victory until the area if fully secured,"" said Iraqi army officer Firas Abdel Qassim. The militants still controlled a small patch, he said.  Abadi has been meeting military and political officials in Mosul in a festive atmosphere which contrasted with the fear that quickly spread when a few hundred Islamic State militants seized the city and the Iraqi army crumbled in July 2014.  Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shocked the Middle East and Western powers shortly afterwards by appearing at the pulpit of Mosul's Grand al-Nuri Mosque in broad daylight and declaring a caliphate and himself the leader of the world's Muslims.  A reign of terror followed which eventually alienated even fellow Sunni Muslims who supported the group, handing an advantage to the security forces.  Baghdadi has fled the city and his exact whereabouts are unknown. Reports have said he is dead but Iraqi and Western officials have not been able to confirm this.  Even if Baghdadi is killed or captured, that is unlikely to cripple Islamic State, which is now expected to take to the desert or mountains of Iraq and wage an insurgency, much like al Qaeda did following the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  ""The recovery of Mosul is a significant step in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism,"" said the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  While defeat in Iraq's second-largest city will deal a heavy blow to Islamic State, the group controls several cities and towns south and west of Mosul.  Islamic State is also under heavy pressure in its operational headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and its self-proclaimed caliphate that once straddled the two countries is crumbling.  The militants, however, are expected to keep plotting attacks on the West and inspiring ""lone wolf"" violence by individuals or small groups, such as recent incidents in Britain, France and elsewhere.  HUMANITARIAN CRISIS  The stench of corpses along Mosul's streets was a reminder of the nearly nine months of grueling urban warfare required to dislodge Islamic State from the city of 1.5 million.  Seven bodies lay in an alley near a riverbank the militants reached on Sunday while attempting to escape.  Much of Mosul has been destroyed in the fighting, with rows of houses flattened by air strikes and centuries-old stone houses gutted by explosions.  Thousands of people have been killed. The United Nations says 920,000 civilians have fled their homes since the military campaign began in October. Close to 700,000 people are still displaced.  Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2u0o515  ""It's a relief to know that the military campaign in Mosul is ending. The fighting may be over, but the humanitarian crisis is not,"" said U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Lise Grande.""Many of the people who have fled have lost everything. They need shelter, food, health care, water, sanitation and emergency kits. The levels of trauma we are seeing are some of the highest anywhere. What people have experienced is nearly unimaginable.""  Iraqi soldiers were relaxed. Some were swimming in the Tigris river. Another wiped the sweat off his face with an Islamic State flag.  Once celebrations end, Iraqi leaders will face the formidable task of managing sectarian tensions in Mosul and elsewhere that enabled Islamic State to initially win support and threaten to create new security challenges.

MANILA: Children and hostages are being forced to fight alongside pro-Islamic State gunmen waging a seven-week battle for a Philippine city, the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military said Monday.  Militants seized Marawi, considered the Muslim capital of the largely Catholic Philippines, on May 23 in a bid to create an IS province, and over 100 remain holed up in the city despite intense military efforts to oust them.

Iraq's leader says national forces backed by a US-led coalition retook the city of Mosul after more than three years of ISIS rule.  Now Iraqis are facing the daunting task of what to do with their historic city, much of it reduced to rubble and still at threat of ISIS attacks.  Iraqi forces planted a national flag on the banks of the Tigris River in Mosul's Old City to declare their victory.  The victory marks an end to a nine-month operation, which began with fighters of different ethnic and religious foundations making a coordinated push toward the city as US-led airstrikes helped pave their way.  Soon, Iraqi officials and the residents of Mosul, as well as their US allies, will need to start looking at a long and challenging to-do list.  Rebuilding a city torn to shreds  Once it is clear Iraqi forces can hold the city, they will have to start thinking about how to rebuild it.  CNN journalists in Mosul's historic Old City saw a place almost entirely reduced to rubble on Monday.  Very few civilians remain in the area -- there is simply nowhere for them to live -- but some were seen trying to return, even visiting the ruins of the Al-Nuri Mosque, which was blown up by ISIS last month  JUST WATCHED Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri blown up Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri blown up 02:22  Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said that there was no time to waste in beginning social and physical reconstruction.  ""The first challenge facing the Iraqi government and international organizations is to provide basic necessities of life for more than 400,000 Iraqis who have been displaced from the western part of Mosul, which mostly lies in ruins,"" Gerges told CNN.  He estimated that rebuilding the Old City alone would cost $1 billion.  In some parts of Mosul, residents have begun to return from displacement camps to think about rebuilding. CNN drove through some of these areas, and saw signs of life returning to normal -- traffic on the roads and chickens being sold in makeshift markets.  Some people have left their villages for safer ones -- like Taysir Mohammed Mahmoud, a former restaurant owner who left the Old City for the safer east with his wife, two children, brother and mother.  He and his family had been used as human shields by militants and were forced to move to another place, where they lived with 10 other families in a basement for five months, he told the UN refugee agency.  ""Thank God we are here. We'll celebrate our new birth,"" says Mahmoud, who lost his home in the fighting.  ""But we will need help ... help to go back, rebuild and get back to work.""  Holding ground and security  In the push toward Mosul, forces liberated dozens of villages in their path from ISIS fighters. In many cases, the militants simply fled and returned when security forces had moved on. In some cases, they came back to carry out mass executions of civilians.  Iraq and its allies will have to work on creating a strong and permanent security presence in Mosul to ensure this does not happen.

MUST WATCH Iraq declares end of ISIS control in Mosul 02:57  ""We all know that ISIS hides among civilian populations and ISIS will be counting on sympathies among certain individuals in the civilian population to operate an insurgency,"" said Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House in London.  ""So it is very important for Iraqi officials to gain the trust of the civilian population to make sure this doesn't happen.""  The US has been heavily criticized for leaving Iraq in a weakened position after its invasion in 2003 and ensuing war. Some critics say that US actions aimed at eradicating al Qaeda in Iraq created the vacuum for ISIS to gain a foothold in the country -- Mosul was the militant group's largest city and its crown jewel.  US officials are aware of the risk of history repeating. They are engaging more with tribal leaders to make sure they have the local buy-in to make sure a new incarnation of ISIS does not find a space in Mosul again.  Iraqi forces celebrate the retaking of Mosul on Sunday.  Gerges warned that the US must learn lessons from the Iraq war.  ""To the Trump administration, one warning is in order: Defeating ISIS militarily is not enough. Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated between 2007 and 2010, yet it made a spectacular return,"" Gerges said to CNN.  The US said last winter that it was helping to train some 15,000 members of a Sunni Iraqi tribal militia to hold the city, but some Iraqi officials have told CNN that they didn't think there had been much progress so far. It's unclear whether that force is ready to be fully deployed.  Liberated parts of eastern Mosul are not exactly peaceful. While ISIS has lost its control there, attacks continue and terror-related arrests are still being made.  It is the same story in other areas liberated from ISIS. The town of Fallujah was liberated in the summer of 2016, but nine months later the mayor had still not returned to live there because of the insecure situation.  Working out who's going to rule  Perhaps one of the biggest challenges on the to-do list is to work out who will be in charge of what.  Talks on who is going to rule Mosul are on the front burner, but a source close to the issue told CNN that essentially nothing had yet been agreed on how the city should be run.  A commission established to discuss these issues has never met, the source said, nor is there an agreement on any form of power sharing among the many groups in Nineveh province on the table.  JUST WATCHED Can ISIS ever be eradicated? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can ISIS ever be eradicated? 01:34  US and Iraqi officials have spoken of creating eight self-governing areas in and around Mosul. Ever since Iraq's new constitution was passed, there's been much talk of local autonomy, but it's rarely been delivered.  Mosul is made up of a diverse group of people with different ethnic and religious backgrounds -- including Sunni and Shia Muslims, Christians, Kurds and Yazidis -- and in the past, the lack of Sunni Muslims in governance has been a source of tension and conflict. ISIS was able to play on this issue and find sympathy among Sunni Muslims in Mosul.  But al-Abadi, the prime minister, has tried hard to brand the fight against ISIS as a national one, involving a range of ethno-religious groups fighting under one national Iraqi flag.  Nonetheless, the extensive role of the Popular Mobilization Units -- which are made up of predominantly Shia groups -- in the ISIS fight hasn't gone unnoticed among Sunnis.",en,terrorattack,1,['Mosul']

The July 2014 appearance was his sole public appearance.  Mosul's population and urban size far exceeded that of Raqqa in Syria, the de facto capital of ISIS.  Mosul is well-equipped, both in agriculture and industry. The high oil production of Iraq's second-biggest city and its tax revenue once provided ISIS with an enormous source of income.  Located near the Syria-Turkey border, Mosul enjoys an exceptional geographical advantage.  Connected with the ISIS-controlled section in northern Syria, its expansive western deserts offered the extremists a wide range of space to operate throughout the two countries.  After two years of war, large stretches of Saladdin and Anbar provinces were successively recaptured by Iraqi forces. After the fight to retake Anbar's heartland Fallujah from ISIS, Iraqi forces spearheaded the next attack on Mosul - the extremists' last base in Iraq.

After four months of fierce battles, in early May, Iraqi forces entered the last stages of defeating the militants in western Mosul.  Iraqi forces launched their final push from multiple directions on June 18.  On June 21, ISIS bombed the city's landmark al-Nuri mosque as Iraqi forces were pushing closer.  On June 29, the capture of the mosque marked the end of the extremist group's stronghold in Iraq.  XINHUA",en,terrorattack,1,['Mosul']

Iraq's prime minister declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city.  In neighboring Syria, U.S.-backed forces have entered Raqqa and are battling Islamic State militants there.  The battlefield advances are a potentially fatal blow to Islamic State's self-proclaimed ""caliphate,"" but also bring fresh challenges and risks, according to Western diplomats and U.S. officials.  The key question, they said, is whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been leery of foreign assistance and ""nation building,"" and allies in Europe and the Middle East lead a long-term campaign of physical and political reconstruction.  ""I think everyone has learnt the hard way that unless you stick around and get the job done, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be back there again in 10 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ time,"" said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  One concern, the officials and diplomats said in interviews, is that Iran could fill the vacuum left by Islamic State to expand its clout in both Iraq and Syria.  Another is that the region's Sunni Muslims, if not given a share of political and economic power, could be vulnerable to Islamic State recruitment as the group reverts from one that holds territory to a shadowy, violent insurgency.  Trump's budget for fiscal year 2018, which begins Oct. 1, would allocate $13 billion for the military fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  ""Are we going to spend even a fraction of the amount on reconstruction?"" asked Jeremy Konyndyk, who oversaw disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development until January.  When the U.S. military withdrew from Iraq in 2011, U.S. aid budgets and personnel were reduced as well, said Konyndyk, now at the Center for Global Development. ""We should not make the same mistake this time (of) taking a really military-centric approach to our engagement and once the military job is done, stripping out most of the other tools.""  TWO-TRACK STRATEGY  The Washington meetings Tuesday through Thursday will focus on ways to intensify a multi-pronged campaign against Islamic State, according to the State Department. That campaign and the overall military strategy were set under Trump's predecessor, U.S. President Barack Obama.  Trump's post-conflict strategy, as described by U.S. officials, follows two tracks.  The United States, they say, will support a robust Iraqi- and United Nations-led effort to stabilize liberated areas in Iraq, where American officials say they have a reliable partner in Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.  But amid Syria's ongoing civil war, Washington is pursuing a more cautious, localized stabilization plan.  Initial stabilization efforts are already underway in eastern Mosul, but officials said the western part of the city, where fighting was more intense, will be the greater challenge.  Nearly 1 million civilians fled the city, according to the United Nations. ""This was beyond our worst-case scenario and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still one step ahead,"" thanks to $1 billion in funding pledged last year, said Lise Grande, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq.  Across Iraq, 1.9 million people have returned home, Grande said, adding ""I'm not sure you would have bet on this.""  Top Trump aides, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, commanded U.S. troops in Iraq and remain committed to the country's security, diplomats and analysts said.  ""The strategy in Iraq will be to prevent an ISIL (Islamic State) recurrence and to prevent an expulsion of the U.S. by Iranian-backed actors. The two issues are viewed as linked,"" said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank.  ""There is a lot of Iraq experience inside this administration and it shows in the long-term commitment to Iraqi security that is being offered,"" Knights said.  Pushing back against Iranian influence won't be easy. Tehran wields clout through some Iraqi politicians and Shiite militias, which have recently deployed towards Iraq's border with Syria.  Syria is even more fraught, officials said, with its multi-sided civil war that has drawn in outside powers including the United States, Russia, Iran and Turkey.  In Syria, ""the campaign against ISIS is moving faster than resolution of the underlying political challenges,"" a State Department official said, using another acronym for Islamic State. ""That has led us to really emphasize the local solutions.""  Washington, he said, is backing local civilian councils to provide basic governance in areas U.S.-backed forces have retaken, such as the city of Tabqa and, ultimately, Raqqa.  The U.S.-led military coalition's focus is on the quick restoration of essential services, ""getting the lights back on. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not reconstructing Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â the official said.  There are also tensions over who should pay for what. U.S. and other Western officials argue that Russia, which intervened to help Syrian President Bashar Assad, should contribute.

A plume of smoke rose into the air from the strike as IS mortar shells landed near Iraqi positions and heavy gunfire could be heard on the western edge of the Old City.  The developments underscored the dangers still posed by the militants after Iraqi forces announced they retook full control of Mosul, the country's second-largest city, three years after it was seized by extremists bent on building a global caliphate.  Amnesty International warned in a report released Tuesday that the conflict in Mosul has created a ""civilian catastrophe,"" with the extremists carrying out forced displacement, summary killings and using civilians as human shields.  The report also detailed violations by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition.  ""The scale and gravity of the loss of civilian lives during the military operation to retake Mosul must immediately be publicly acknowledged at the highest levels of government in Iraq and states that are part of the U.S.-led coalition,"" said Lynn Maalouf, the research director for Mideast at Amnesty.  The report, which covers the first five months of this year, noted how IS fighters moved civilians with them around the city, preventing them from escaping, creating battle spaces with dense civilian populations while ""Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition failed to adapt their tactics.""  The Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition ""continued to use imprecise, explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated urban environments,"" Amnesty stated, adding that some violations may constitute war crimes.  On Monday evening, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi came to Mosul for the second day in a row to declare ""total victory."" Flanked by his senior military leadership at a small base on the edge of the Old City, al-Abadi said ""this great feast day crowned the victories of the fighters and the Iraqis for the past three years.""  But the Iraqi leader also alluded to the brutality of the conflict, saying the triumph had been achieved ""by the blood of our martyrs.""  In Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief urged Iraq's government to ensure that human rights will be respected in Mosul.  Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein described Mosul's fall as the ""turning point"" in the conflict against IS, but warned the group continues to subject people to ""daily horrors"" in its remaining strongholds of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, and Hawijah, north of Baghdad.  ""Horrific though the crimes of ISIL are, there is no place for vengeance,"" said Zeid, who is a Jordanian prince, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group.  He cited allegations of threats of collective punishment and forced evictions in Mosul by Iraqi security forces and their allies. He also cited three years of rights violations during IS' control of Mosul, including abuses like sexual slavery of women and girls that ""have left deep scars on Iraqi society.""  In Baghdad, Shiite politician Karim al-Nouri warned that defeating IS in Mosul doesn't mean that ""terrorism"" is finished and urged the government to review its policies for dealing with Sunni areas of the country to ""avoid previous mistakes that led to the emergence"" of IS.  The government needs to work on ""removing fears of marginalization and terrorism affiliation in Sunni areas,"" said al-Nouri, a senior member of Badr Organization. He said he believes the Iraqi security forces should stay in Mosul until it is fully secure, before handing over to local forces.  While Mosul fell to the Islamic State group in a matter of days in 2014, the campaign to retake the city, which began last October, has lasted nearly nine months.  For more than two years before the operation started, Iraqi forces backed by coalition airstrikes slowly clawed back territory from IS elsewhere in Iraq, and tens of thousands of Iraqi troops went through a massive coalition training program.  The IS defeat in Mosul dealt a huge blow to the group's so-called Islamic ""caliphate"" Ã¢â‚¬â€ territory that the militants seized, spanning large swaths of both Iraq and Syria Ã¢â‚¬â€ but also killed thousands, left entire neighborhoods in ruins and displaced nearly 900,000 from their homes.  Thousands of civilians are estimated to have been killed in the fight for the city, according to the provincial council of Nineveh, where Mosul is the capital Ã¢â‚¬â€ a toll that does not include those still believed buried under collapsed buildings.  Iraq's military does not release official casualty numbers for soldiers killed in combat.  A statement late Monday from IS claimed its fighters were still attacking Iraqi soldiers in the al-Maydan area of Mosul's Old City, purportedly killing and wounding many and seizing weapons and ammunition.  ""The soldiers of the caliphate in Mosul continue to accomplish epics until they achieve either victory or martyrdom,"" it said.  Also Monday, the United Nations said that of the more than 897,000 people displaced from Mosul, thousands will probably not be able to return because of ""extensive damage caused during the conflict.""  ""Make no mistake, this victory alone does not eliminate ISIS, and there's still a tough fight ahead,"" Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top U.S. commander in Iraq said in a recorded video from Baghdad following al-Abadi's statement. ISIS is another acronym for IS, also referred to as Daesh, an Arabic name.  ""The coalition will continue to support our Iraqi partners until ISIS is defeated in Iraq,"" Townsend added, calling on Iraqis to unite and prevent a return of the conditions that allowed the extremists' rise more than three years ago.  ___  Associated Press writers Susannah George in Irbil, Iraq; Maamoun Youssef in Cairo, Jamey Keaten in Geneva, Switzerland, and Sinan Salaheddin in Baghdad contributed to this report.",en,terrorattack,1,['Mosul']

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over ISIS in Mosul on Monday (July 10), marking the biggest defeat for the hardline Sunni group since its lightning sweep through northern Iraq three years ago.  But the militants, armed with machine guns and mortars, have now seized more than 75 per cent of Imam Gharbi, a village on the western bank of the Tigris river some 70km south of Mosul, and reinforcements are expected, the Iraqi army officer said.  ISIS launched its attack on Imam Gharbi last week, in the kind of strike it is expected to deploy now as US-backed Iraqi forces regain control over cities the group captured during its shock 2014 offensive.  Stripped of Mosul, ISIS' dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city.  ISIS also faces pressure in its operational base in the Syrian city of Raqqa, where US-backed Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces have seized territory on three sides of the city.  The campaign to retake Mosul from the militants was launched last October by a 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias, with a US-led coalition providing key air and ground support.  Abadi's government in Iraq now faces a difficult task managing the sectarian tensions which enabled ISIS to gain supporters in the country among fellow Sunnis who say they were marginalised by the Shi'ite-led government.  The US-led coalition warned that victory in Mosul did not mark the end of the group's global threat. ""Now it is time for all Iraqis to unite to ensure ISIS (Islamic State) is defeated across the rest of Iraq and that the conditions that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq are not allowed to return again,"" Lieutenant General Stephen J.

The pilgrims were on their way back from the Amarnath shrine deep in the Himalayas when their bus got caught up in the crossfire near the town of Anantnag, police said.  Twelve pilgrims were wounded in the fighting triggered after the militants attacked a police bunker and another police party at a checkpoint.  The attack has stirred the ire of hardline Hindu groups tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party who have long sought tough action against militants fighting Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir.  In the Hindu-dominated Jammu region of the Indian state, saffron-clad members of the right-wing Bajrang Dal group stopped cars to enforce a strike in memory of the pilgrims.  Protests also took place in the country's financial capital of Mumbai and the industrial city of Ahmedabad in the west. ""Pained beyond words on the dastardly attack on peaceful Amarnath pilgrims in Jammu and Kashmir,"" Modi said on social network Twitter.  ""The attack deserves strongest condemnation from everyone,""he added, saying he had spoken to the state's governor and chief minister to assure them of all possible help.  Hundreds of thousands of Hindus visit the Amarnath cave, 12,000 feet (3,658m) above sea level in the picturesque Lidder Valley, in the months of July and August every year.  Pilgrims trek through treacherous mountain passes to the shrine, where devotees worship a phallus-shaped ice stalagmite seen as a symbol of Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.  Police superintendent Altaf Khan said the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba was behind the attack aimed at sowing sectarian discord.  But the militant group rejected the allegation, calling the attack ""reprehensible"", and accusing India of trying to sabotage the freedom struggle of the Kashmiris.  Separatist leaders also condemned the attack. ""This incident goes against the very grain of Kashmiri ethos,"" separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Farooq and Yasin Malik said in a joint statement.  ""The annual Amarnath yatra has been going on peacefully for centuries and is part of our yearly rhythm and will remain so.""  Militants battling Indian rule in Kashmir have largely spared the pilgrimage, even during the most violent phases of their 28-year armed revolt.  About 150,000 pilgrims have already completed the journey to Amarnath and tens of thousands more are expected to do so by the time it ends in late August.  India has been struggling to restore normality in Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim in full but rule in part.

The nine-month offensive to recapture the northern city began in October, with thousands killed or displaced before Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city.  Reuters has re-released a selection of pictures from the offensive along with our photographers' accounts of the events behind them.  They can be seen by clicking: http://reut.rs/2sMj8og  As U.S.-led coalition air strikes hit the Tahrir district of eastern Mosul in November, Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic was on the streets and captured the panic from one strike that sent civilians fleeing for safety.  ""It was close and total panic ensued. People were screaming, ducking and running away,"" he said.  The air strikes aided the 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias who made ground against the militants, some of whom were manhandled when found hiding among civilians.  Reuters photographer Alaa Al-Marjani captured the moment one suspect was ""tossed into the bed of the pickup truck"" in February during patrols in the west of the city.  Other militants were shot on site. Tomasevic photographed over the shoulder of one Iraqi special forces soldier as he fired on an Islamic State suicide bomber in March.  ""I took the picture seconds later standing just behind the shooter in silhouette, with the suicide bomber visible through a shell hole in the house wall, dead on the ground in a spreading pool of blood,"" he said.

""I felt bad because I could not do anything else for her apart from photographing her to show the world what physical and mental state the people who flee Mosul are in, Bensemra said.

While ISIS has almost entirely been decimated in the Iraqi city of Mosul, the Islamic group still controls other pockets of the country and swaths of neighboring Syria Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including its self-styled capital of Raqqa in northern Syria. The terrorist group has increasingly resorted to using civilians as human shields Ã¢â‚¬â€œ making the battles all the more challenging and frustrating and ultimately leading to more deaths within the ranks of Iraqi troops.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suicide belts are strapped on to helpless civilians Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including women and children Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by ISIS,Ã¢â‚¬Â Karim Aljobory of the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Forces told Fox News. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This was a big dilemma. We didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know who was a bomber and who was not. Many of our men died from these people forced to be bombers.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Related Image Expand / Collapse  A high-ranking Iraqi military official confirmed numerous incidents of ISIS Ã¢â‚¬Å“using human shields and fighting from civilian homes, mosques, hospitals and schools.Ã¢â‚¬Â However, launching attacks from civilian-centric locations is hardly the only way in which the jihadist army uses human shields.  Sometimes, the gambit is as blatant as tying up locals and placing them in front of the ISIS fighter who is then able to attack from behind the civilian. Fox News also witnessed incidences of ISIS filling its cars with children to flee from city to city, knowing the coalition warplanes would thus not bomb them. ISIS also kidnapped and drugged boys as young as 8 and placed them at the very front of their frontlines.  Yazidi sex slaves have been forced into underground ISIS prisons and literally draped over their captors as protection against coalition strikes. Several survivors of such strikes have scars from absorbing the strikes. Entire families have been held hostage by ISIS operatives who take over their homes and shuffle them from place to place. If they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play along, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re slaughtered on the spot. Female ISIS members have reportedly stooped to utilizing their own babies: They have been known to carry their infants to appear to be harmless mothers and thus avoid being attacked. And in remaining strongholds such as Raqqa, ISIS has pushed civilians into the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s center to live in tents on the street and thus act as one giant shield to maintain domination over the heart of its Ã¢â‚¬Å“caliphate capital.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Related Image Expand / Collapse  According to Mubin Shaikh, a counterterrorism expert on ISIS for the U.S. military and nonmilitary agencies, ISIS, especially in urban combat zones such as Mosul and Raqqa, also hijacks homes of civilians and booby traps the structure, then secretly herds civilians inside Ã¢â‚¬â€œ well aware that it will soon become a target for an airstrike.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes, (they) will even trigger a secondary explosion so the military is left dealing with an investigation of women and kids killed,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  ISIS has, moreover, come to use human shields as a financing apparatus, extorting money from civilians by threatening to use them as shields if they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pay up.  Related Image Expand / Collapse  While the tactic of using people as shields is hardly new in war, ISISÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rampant use of it has been unprecedented. As a result, it took Iraqi and partner forces nine months to liberate Mosul, despite initial hopes it would take only a few months. And in the waning weeks of the battle for the city, human shields became even more commonplace as a weapon of war. Now with the Raqqa fight heating up, shield deployment is also on the rise.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“An enemy is most dangerous when on the defensive, or when they are fighting for survival,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Matt Degn, a professor in counterterrorism at the American Military University. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is not an easy fight, ISIS is not the Ã¢â‚¬ËœJV team.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ISIS does whatever it takes regardless of consequences to accomplish their tactical operations and strategic goals.Ã¢â‚¬Â  MORE THAN 180,000 IRAQI CIVILIANS KILLED SINCE 2003, REPORT  GRIEVING IRAQIS CALL ON US TO INVESTIGATE MASSACRE OF 1,600 MILITARY CADETS  One high-level Iraqi official, who requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media, told Fox News that the use of human shields has been at the forefront of military planning, and in the quest to prevent collateral damage, a larger than anticipated number of Iraqi soldiers have lost their lives.  Related Image Expand / Collapse  While officials have not released exact figures to eschew a loss in morale, it is estimated that hundreds of losses have been incurred monthly in the ISIS war.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Using human shields has made things very difficult for the liberating forces, as it forced them to expose themselves to the enemy, especially in close quarters combat in MosulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Old City,Ã¢â‚¬Â the official explained. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Iraqi forces, particularly the counterterrorism forces, have been under strict instructions from the commander-in-chief, Prime Minister Haidar Alabadi, to do their utmost to protect civilians, and as a result they have sustained high casualty rates. Unfortunately, there have been civilian casualties too.Ã¢â‚¬Â  ISIS uses shields not only to delay strikes on ISIS targets, but also to endanger advancing troops by ensuring that they can only advance to a point that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“manageableÃ¢â‚¬Â to the terrorist group, Shaikh said.  In addition, the Islamic group uses human shields to stir up anti-coalition sentiment for the times when civilians are caught in the crossfire. For example, reports are civilian deaths surged this year Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with one alleged U.S. strike killing as many as 200 people in March and prompting international outcry.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The media will then amplify the detrimental impact of civilian casualties. No one wants to see women and kids killed by our bombs,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  So how do Iraqi forces and their coalition partners purport to avoid killing helpless civilian shields while still defeating the barbaric enemy?  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have limited our use of airstrikes in the Old City of Mosul, because buildings are very old and it could cause them to collapse and kill civilians, also an ISIS tactic. We attacked on foot when we could, accompanied by bomb squads to dismantle IEDs,Ã¢â‚¬Â Aljobory, the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Forces leader, explained. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We use snipers and light, as well as mid-sized rather than large weapons, to avoid hitting civilians.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Aljobory additionally pointed out that when several ISIS fighters are grouped together they use hellfire missiles, which have a Ã¢â‚¬Å“controlled, limited destruction range,Ã¢â‚¬Â generally up to 50 feet, to minimize civilian casualties.  Related Image Expand / Collapse  Ã¢â‚¬Å“When you look at how many civilians were able to escape this cruel occupation, added Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan, deputy commanding general of Operation Inherent Resolve. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It becomes clear how careful Iraqi Forces have been when attacking.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Often, the Iraqi and partner coalition forces simply have to wait until a high-value target leaves the premise, and then a precision capture or kill will be attempted -- or wait until civilians flee before striking.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The U.S.-supported coalition forces in Iraq are adhering to the rules of combat to the best extent possible, including not attacking human shields used by ISIS,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Amit Kumar, president of counterterrorism firm AAA International Security Consultants. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ISIS forces have used the hesitancy on the part of the U.S. as a ploy to save themselves from attacks.

Somali commandos accompanied by U.S. forces in two helicopters raided two locations, the official said. They included a detention center run by al-Shabaab in Kunya-Barrow village in Lower Shabelle region, and an unknown number of detainees were freed.  Troops engaged a small number of extremist fighters, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.  U.S. Africa Command spokesman Mark Cheadle said U.S. forces conducted an ""advise and assist mission"" against al-Shabaab with members of the Somali National Army in Kunya-Barrow. He gave no further details.  There were no U.S. casualties, AFRICOM spokeswoman Jennifer Dyrcz added Friday morning.  The Al Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab said via its Andalus radio arm that its fighters foiled an attempted raid by U.S. and African forces.  Earlier this month, the U.S. military said it carried out an airstrike against al-Shabaab in Somalia and was assessing the results. The airstrike followed another last month that the U.S. said killed eight extremists at a rebel command and logistics camp in the country's south. Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said a training camp near Sakow in the Middle Juba region had been destroyed.  President Donald Trump has approved expanded military operations against al-Shabaab, including more aggressive airstrikes and considering parts of southern Somalia areas of active hostilities. The U.S. in April announced it was sending dozens of regular troops in the largest such deployment to Somalia in roughly two decades, saying it was for logistics training of the country's army.  The Horn of Africa nation is trying to rebuild after more than two decades as a failed state, and its chaos helped in al-Shabaab's rise. Now a new threat has emerged in the country's north with some fighters claiming alliance to the Islamic State group.  Al-Shabaab last year became Africa's deadliest Islamic extremist group, with more than 4,200 people killed in 2016, according to the Pentagon-supported Africa Center for Strategic Studies. The extremist group has vowed to step up attacks against the recently elected government and has carried out numerous deadly attacks in the capital, Mogadishu.  Pressure is growing on Somalia's military to assume full responsibility for the country's security. The 22,000-strong African Union multinational force, AMISOM, which has been supporting the fragile central government, plans to start withdrawing in 2018 and leave by the end of 2020.  The U.S. military has been among those expressing concern that Somalia's forces are not yet ready.",en,terrorattack,,
424937,skynews,Political Correspondent Tom Rayner,President Erdogan celebrates failed coup in Turkey on first anniversary,http://news.sky.com/story/president-erdogan-celebrates-failed-coup-in-turkey-on-first-anniversary-10948911,,15/7/2017 8:16,"One year on, and the history of the failed coup in Turkey is very much being written by the victor.  The anniversary of the bloody but botched attempt to seize power by factions within the military will be led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and marked by official events right across the country.  The commemorations are billed as tributes to the 'epic heroism' of the Turkish people who fought and, in 250 cases, died to protect the country's democracy.  According to President Erdogan and his supporters, the attempted putsch was not an attack on him or his government, but an aggressive assault on the Turkish people - and their act of resistance must now be forged into the national memory.  Ravza Kavakci, deputy chair of President Erdogan's AK Party, said the events would be about more than mourning the dead.  ""There was an attack on our democracy, and everybody took to the streets,"" she said.  ""We have to celebrate this victory of the people, how they overcame the tanks, and how they stood for their democracy.""  Image: President Erdogan says the attempted coup was an assault on the Turkish people  But in the 12 months that have passed since the coup, there has been growing criticism of the wide-ranging programme of retribution that has been meted out.  So far, more than 50,000 people have been detained, not just from the military, but also journalists, lawyers, human-rights workers and opposition MPs.  Up to 150,000 state workers, including teachers, civil servants and members of the judiciary have also been suspended or dismissed from their posts.  With around a quarter of all judges and prosecutors sacked, there is now severe backlog in the court system, with thousands of cases yet to be processed. Lawyers say it could take years to work through.  The Turkish Government says those arrested or suspended are followers of exiled US-based cleric Fetullah Gulen, the one-time ally now foe of Mr Erdogan, who is accused of masterminding the coup.  ""They penetrated everywhere,"" Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told the Reuters news agency.  ""We are talking about a structure (going back) more than 40 years, hence it is not possible to cleanse it in one day.""  But critics claim President Erdogan is using the failed putsch as a pretext to undertake a broader purge of all opposition and suppress freedom of expression.  Professor Utku Balaban was suspended by executive order from his lecturing post at the prestigious Faculty of Political Science at Ankara University in February.  Video: Show trial? Turkey coup suspects marched into court  He and around 40 colleagues were accused of supporting terrorism by signing an academic petition, months before the coup, that criticised Turkish military action impacting Kurdish civilians in the southeast of the country.  ""Right after this failed coup they just brought this issue up once again, and by they, I mean the government,"" Professor Balaban told Sky News.  ""Now we begin to be called terrorists and Mr Gulen's supporters, and so on and so forth.  ""I don't like being stigmatised as a terrorist, I can easily say that. I don't believe I am a terrorist or supporting a terrorist organisation.""  The Turkish government has said an independent commission will review complaints made by those who feel they have been unfairly arrested or suspended, but critics question the independence of the government-appointed body.  Last weekend, hundreds of thousands joined an opposition rally, marking the culmination of a 'march for justice' from Ankara to Istanbul led by the leader of the main opposition party, the CHP.  The rally, protesting the post-coup crackdown, called for an end to the State of Emergency that was declared shortly after the attempted coup, that has allowed the Turkish government to rule by decree, without having to consult parliament.  Speaking to Sky News inside the parliament building in Ankara, Utku Cakirozer from the opposition CH Party, said: ""This place should be the place, but it's being bypassed by the regime and it has turned to be one man rule in this country.  ""So right now there is no use in the parliament and people are looking for justice and looking for democracy and rule of law in the streets.  Image: Protesters outside court shouted 'we want the death penalty' during the procession  ""I really hope that this voice can be heard by those who are governing, but looking at the immediate response coming from the government circles. It's so unfortunate as it seems they see this march as a support for Gullenists or for terror - I mean this could not be more wrong.  On Saturday evening, President Erdogan will lead a 'National Unity March' across the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul - now renamed 'Martyrs Bridge' - which was blockaded by tanks on the evening of 15 June 2016.  At midnight, 'prayers for the martyrs' will then be read aloud in mosques throughout the country.  At 2.32am on Sunday, President Erdogan will go on to deliver a statement in the parliament in Ankara, to mark the precise moment one year ago when military jets bombed the building.  Today, much of the parliament complex has been rebuilt, but a blast hole in one of the central atriums, right next to what was the Prime Minister's office, has been left untouched - an intentional, jagged memorial to the violence of that night.",en,terrorattack,,

He fled to southern France during a court recess and later to Spain, where he joined the Secret Army Organization, an underground band of right-ring military and civilian extremists that used terrorism tactics to fight against Algerian independence.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Raoul Salan, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commander, was a highly decorated French general who had turned against de Gaulle and participated in a failed military coup in Algeria in April 1961. Paul Henissart wrote in his book Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wolves in the City: The Death of French AlgeriaÃ¢â‚¬Â (1970) that Mr. Susini regarded Mr. Salan as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“tactician rather than a strategist,Ã¢â‚¬Â who was better at exploiting circumstances than creating them.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This seemed a welcome state of affairs to Susini, whose limitless ambition was to create, himself, an entirely new set of circumstances, as part of what he believed was a revolution,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mr. Henissart wrote.  When Mr. Salan was captured in Algiers nearly a year later, The New York Times reported that Mr. Susini was believed to control of Ã¢â‚¬Å“a number of terrorist groups operating against Moslems in the streets of the city. He is believed to be the exponent of the most ruthless wing of the organization.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Mr. Susini was a compelling speaker and propagandist for the Secret Army, as well as a staunch advocate of bombings and murders to preserve French control of Algeria.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We sought to mobilize the population and the army for a new coup,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, according to an English translation of an interview he gave in 2008 to the French journalist FranÃƒÂ§ois Malye. Ã¢â‚¬Å“To convince them that his time we can succeed, we must appear in the eyes of all as an army of fighters, a revolutionary party capable Ã¢â‚¬â€ there are precedents Ã¢â‚¬â€ to change the course of history.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Skinny and fair-haired, Mr. Susini was described by a United Press International correspondent as having Ã¢â‚¬Å“little time for things physical,Ã¢â‚¬Â adding, Ã¢â‚¬Å“He has managed to maintain a sickly pallor in a country where everyone has a tan.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Independence finally came to Algeria in 1962, but Mr. Susini was nonetheless involved in plotting to kill de Gaulle later that year and again in 1964. Details of the first attempt Ã¢â‚¬â€ in which de GaulleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Citroen was raked by machine gun fire outside Paris but he was unharmed Ã¢â‚¬â€ were used by the novelist Frederick Forsyth to open his 1971 thriller, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Day of the Jackal.Ã¢â‚¬Â The film adapted from the novel two years later opened the same way, with de Gaulle and his motorcade attacked by gunmen.  Asked by Mr. Malye why he tried to assassinate de Gaulle even after the war in Algeria had ended, Mr. Susini said it was to hold him responsible for the massacre of people Ã¢â‚¬Å“slaughtered like rabbitsÃ¢â‚¬Â and for the exodus of one million European Algerians. Mr. Susini had separately said that the Secret Army first began plotting de GaulleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder in late 1961.  De Gaulle pardoned him in 1968, sparing him the death sentence.  Asked if he had regrets, Mr. Susini cited an attack in 1962 on the townhouse in Paris where the novelist AndrÃƒÂ© Malraux lived. Mr. Malraux, who was FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minister of cultural affairs at the time, was not at home, but the bomb blast maimed a 4-year-old girl who also lived in the building. The Secret Army was believed to have detonated other bombs in Paris that day, injuring several other people.

According to various accounts, his father was a Communist railway worker. Mr. Susini was very close to his maternal grandmother Ã¢â‚¬â€ whose political leanings rested with the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini.  Mr. Susini studied medicine at schools in Lyon and Strasbourg, France, but returned to Algeria to attend the University of Algiers, where he became a student activist.  Well after Algeria became independent, Mr. Susini took up permanent residence in France. He served prison sentences in the 1970s for robbery and kidnapping. He ran unsuccessfully for office in Marseille on the right-wing National Front ticket in 1997. Among those who praised him after his death was Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the National Front.

444483,cnn,Nathan A Thompson Cnn,Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh: From horror to hopelessness,http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/16/asia/bangladesh-myanmar-rohingya-refugees/index.html,16/7/2017 0:00,17/7/2017 10:19,"Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh (CNN) Children with henna-painted hands play outside mud-walled hovels with damaged roofs in one of Bangladesh's biggest refugee camps.  They're among 276,000 Rohingya people living in camps and informal settlements in and around Cox's Bazar, according to estimates by the United Nation Human Rights Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).  The government says around 100 people were killed in the four-month operation, human rights groups say the total is far higher and could amount to genocide.  Of the thousands of people now crammed in camps in Bangladesh, only 12% are registered refugees with access to education, which means most of these children will only play until they are strong enough to be put to work, perhaps breaking bricks or planting rice.  And that's if they are lucky enough to stay in the country.  A girl collects water in an unofficial refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.  ""We are a small country with a huge population,"" said Najnin Sarwar Kaberi, organizing secretary for the ruling Awami League party in Cox's Bazar. If the refugees ""settle here permanently, it will increase unemployment so we can't give them the same opportunities as our citizens.""  Rohingya Muslims are regularly referred to as among the world's most persecuted people.  They're not included on the list of 135 recognized national ethnic groups under Myanmar's 1982 Citizenship Law.  The ruling Myanmar government considers them Bengali, but the Bangladesh government doesn't recognize them as such.  With no country to call home, they are officially stateless.  For decades, outbreaks of violence have forced thousands to flee, many across the border to Bangladesh. From there, some move onto India and Malaysia, with the most recent waves coming in 2012 and again in 2016.  Reluctant help  Bangladesh is not party to the UN convention on refugees and refuses to provide most Rohingya access to education, healthcare and work.  The country hasn't registered any new refugees since 1992, according to the Burma Human Rights Yearbook , hoping the tough line will dissuade new arrivals.  Despite the influx of new refugees, the Bangladesh government's line has remained consistent. ""We hope the Rohingya will be able to return to Myanmar,"" said Kaberi. ""Our population levels are already an unbearable burden.""  But as conditions in Myanmar are worsening, the Rohingya continue to arrive, crowding the already over-populated camps in Cox's Bazar.  In response, Bangladesh has floated the idea of relocating the Rohingya to Thengar Char, an uninhabited -- and some unstable -- newly formed silt island that emerged in 2006 from the Bay of Bengal.  ""The government is making arrangements on the island for the Rohingya to provide them with food and homes,"" said Additional District Controller Md. Saiful Islam Majmuder of the Hatiya local government, which administers the 30,000 hectares island. ""We will provide all the facilities they need,"" he added.  But not everyone agrees. The planned relocation will result in an ""humanitarian disaster"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch.  Sending refugees to an island that ""floods at high tide, has no potable water or potential for agriculture, and is infested with pirates, is the equivalent of a death sentence,"" he added.  Leaving home  Roshon Jaman escaped from her village in Myanmar in November 2016. She is now staying with relatives who have lived in the Kutupalong refugee camp south of Cox's Bazar since the 1990s. She sifted rice while her nephews and nieces gathered as we spoke.  Roshon Jaman describes fleeing violence in Myanmar.  In Rakhine, Jaman said she was often afraid to leave her house at night through fear, she says, that her neighbors, part of Myanmar's majority Buddhist population, would attack her. Even so, she was reluctant to move.  She had papaya and mango trees she planted as a girl and a garden bulging with sweet potato and pumpkin.  But she said when her uncle and cousin, who lived at the other end of the village, were burned alive in their homes by Myanmar military personnel, she left.  The incident occurred during a four-month military-led counter-terrorism operation , initiated in response to a spate of Rohingya militant attacks on border posts on October 9 that left nine police officers dead.  The Myanmar army has repeatedly said its response to the attacks was proportionate and has denied allegations that it targeted civilians.  Authorities have denied claims the military burned down houses as part of the pursuit of the offenders.  JUST WATCHED Inside the Rohingya resistance Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside the Rohingya resistance 03:26  The government-owned New Light of Myanmar newspaper published photos of an area that Human Rights Watch said had suffered arson attacks, that showed only minimal damage. A panel from the Myanmar army attributed the damage to ""Rohingya militants.""  According to an International Crisis Group report, the Rohingya militants were part of the Harakah al-Yaqin (Faith Movement), an emerging Muslim insurgency.  Many of the Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar have denied the claim, insisting the group is non-violent.  ""The group is only to campaign for our rights and citizenship,"" said Jaman.  'Rape the mother and burn the house'  Hasna Akter fled Rakhine State with her family last December.  They said they had to sell their home for half its value to Burmese neighbors and paid smugglers about $620 to get into Bangladesh. Getting to the border was easy. ""You're Bengali, better run home,"" the soldiers mocked, pointing the way with their rifles, she said.  The OHCHR report hints at the horror they left behind.  Hasna Akter prepares fish to feed her family in a rented shack in Cox's Bazar, Bangaldesh.  Researchers interviewed 204 Rohingya people who gave ""consistent testimony indicating that hundreds of Rohingya houses, schools, markets, shops, madrasas and mosques were burned by the army, police and sometimes civilian mobs.""  Worse still, the report detailed widespread torture, gang rape and the butchering of children. When asked about this, Hasna Akter used her headscarf to dry tears.  ""First, they get the men out of the house, then they rape the mother and burn the house down. If they like the women a lot, they take her to the camp, rape her again and then kill and bury her,"" she said.  Deputy Director-General U Zaw Htay of the Myanmar President's Office denied rape charges. ""During the investigation into rape accusations in the conflict areas, local women replied that no rape cases happened,"" he said at a press conference in November.  After crossing the Naf River that divides Myanmar's Rakhine State and Bangladesh, Akter said the smuggler introduced them to a fishing captain who gave her husband a job. Now they live in an informal refugee settlement by the sea while their eight children slowly forget how to read and write.  They have received no aid apart from some rudimentary medicine from the International Organization for Migration. ""Many journalists come to talk to us, but no one ever helps us,"" said Akter.  Mohammed Shafiqul Huq, president of the central mosque in Cox's Bazar, says that all Muslims should be concerned. ""We want to help them but we have to get permission from the government,"" adding that his mosque has not yet sought permission to do so.  Crimes against humanity?  Things have gotten much worse in recent years. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said the group found that ""ethnic cleansing clearly took place during attacks on the Rohingya in June and October 2012.""  Robertson said the watchdog is now collecting evidence to show crimes against humanity took place at the end of 2016. The group's task has been made tougher by strict restrictions by the Myanmar government on the movement of journalists and the UN Rights Council in Rakhine.  On March 24, the Human Rights Council decided to send a team to probe ""alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces.""

Myanmar's leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who this year denied any ethnic cleansing had taken place in Rakhine, has expressed resistance to the UN probe.  ""We do not agree with it ... [because] we do not think that the resolution is in keeping with what is actually happening on the ground,"" she said in May while visiting the EU in Brussels.  Suu Kyi has also pointed out that there is already a domestic commission headed by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan assessing the Rakhine situation.  According to the commission's website they intend to tackle ""complex and delicate issues in Rakhine state in accordance with established international standards."" The problems include poverty, development, reconciliation and ""assurance of basic rights.""  While politicians and civil society clash over definitions of human rights and ethnic cleansing, Rohingya people continue to board night boats to Teknaf in Bangladesh, hidden in tanks used to store the day's catch.  Those who can't afford to pay smugglers grab hold of tanks and try to float across the mile-wide Naf River.  Aktar and her family were lucky they raised enough money to pay a smuggler. Doubly so when the man found them work aboard the fishing boats, but it's still unrelentingly tough to survive.  ""If we don't get any fish we only eat rice and salt,"" said Aktar, squatting outside her home.  Tears in the tarpaulin roof were plugged with plastic and held in place with netting.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said state and territory police forces would remain as the first response to such incidents, but the military would offer support to enhance their capabilities.  Under the proposed law changes, state and territory governments would be able to call for military help at any time after a ""terror incident"" has been declared. Previously, the military could only be called upon once police concluded they could no longer deal with an incident.  Turnbull said future attacks would likely remain the responsibility of the police but the military could also assist in incidents such as a central Sydney cafe siege in December 2014 in which two hostages were killed.  A coronial inquiry found in May that police failed to respond quickly enough to end the 16-hour siege, which has been described as Australia's deadliest incident inspired by Islamic State extremists. The gunman, who was killed by police, had no direct ties to the militant group.  ""In the current threat environment, it is most likely that a terrorist attack will use simple methodologies, a knife, a gun, a vehicle, and the attack itself could be over in minutes,"" Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.  ""In worse case scenarios, the ADF (Australian Defence Force) has a range of specialist capabilities to resolve complex terrorist incidents, especially protracted sieges or hostage situations,"" he said.  The Sydney cafe siege and a series of other ""lone wolf""attacks have thrown police tactics, and Australia's overall response to potential security incidents, into sharp focus.  Australian police have since changed tactics to become ready to end cases of potential hostage-taking more quickly, and to shoot suspects in ""terrorist-related"" incidents.  In June, police also began installing concrete bollards in pedestrian thoroughfares in Australia's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, to guard against possible vehicle attacks such as those seen recently in Europe and the United States.  ""The key thing we need is the most flexible possible arrangements - the threat's changed very significantly,"" Justice Minister Michael Keenan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.  Australia is a staunch US ally and has sent troops to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq. It has also been on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East.",en,terrorattack,,

""Baghdadi is definitely alive. He is not dead. We have information that he is alive. We believe 99 percent he is alive,"" Lahur Talabany told Reuters in an interview.  ""Don't forget his roots go back to al Qaeda days in Iraq. He was hiding from security services. He knows what he is doing.""  The secretive Islamic State leader has frequently been reported killed or wounded since he climbed up to the pulpit of a mosque in Mosul in 2014 and declared a caliphate with himself the leader of all Muslims.  After leading his fighters on a sweep through northern Iraq, Baghdadi attempted to create a self-sustaining modern-day caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.  He is now a man on the run, but still a cunning foe, said Talabany, who as part of the international coalition against Islamic State has been at the forefront of efforts to track Baghdadi down.  ""He is not an easy figure. He has years of experience in hiding and getting away from the security services,"" Talabany said.  ""The territory they control right now, still to this day, is very tough territory. It is still not the end of the game for ISIL. Even though they have lost almost all of Mosul and they are getting ready to lose Raqqa as well.""  Iraqi security forces have ended three years of Islamic State rule in the Iraqi city of Mosul, and the group is under growing pressure in Raqqa - former strongholds in the militants' crumbling caliphate.  Talabany said Islamic State was now shifting tactics despite low morale and it would take three or four years to eliminate the group as it takes to the mountains and deserts to stage hit and run attacks and unleash suicide bombers.  Primed for a New Battle  ""They are getting ready for a different fight I think. We have a lot tougher days ahead of us than people think. ""Al Qaeda on steroids,"" said Talabany.  A top Kurdish counter-terrorism official Lahur Talabany speaks during an interview with Reuters in Sulaimania, Iraq July 17, 2017. Ari Jalal  ""We saw why they were smarter. Al Qaeda never controlled any territory. They will be smarter.""  Numerous reports suggesting that Baghdadi had been killed have raised questions about who might replace him as head of a diverse group comprised of Iraqis and other Arabs as well as hardcore foreign fighters.  Iraqi intelligence officers who served under Saddam Hussein have been described as the military strategists instrumental in creating an Islamic State reign of terror.  Talabany said it was hard to know which top Baghdadi aides were alive or dead, but he believes most of the leadership is in Syria, south of Raqqa.  A top Kurdish counter-terrorism official Lahur Talabany speaks during an interview with Reuters in Sulaimania, Iraq July 17, 2017. Ari Jalal  A younger generation of Saddam's former allies were expected to take key positions.  ""These are the people in line,"" he said. ""The younger generation is always more dangerous.""  Security services face the daunting challenge of breaking up sleeper cells, typically made up of two facilitators and two operators.  ""You don't need a lot of guys to set a bomb off. We continue to bust these sleeper cells,"" said Talabany.  ""Everybody we capture was getting ready to set up to carry out attacks in the region.""  Talabany left Iraq when he was a 12-year-old boy, at a time when Saddam Hussein was oppressing the Kurds. His relatives were waging a guerrilla campaign from mountain hideouts.  Asked to compare the challenges then compared to those now as Islamic State tries to recover and sectarian tensions threaten Iraq's security, he said:  ""We have a lot more freedom now.

Photo: Emil Salman.  JERUSALEM -- Muslim worshippers held protest outside the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem on Monday morning, as Israel reopened the compound to Israelis for the first time since Friday's deadly assault, China's Xinhua news agency reported.  A police statement said the site was opened early in the morning ""without special incident. Hundreds of Muslims have entered the site since the morning.""  Outside the compound, dozens of Muslim worshippers refused to enter the site due to new security measures, including CCTVs covering the entire compound, checkpoints and metal detectors at the entrances that Israel had implanted following the shooting attack, which killed two police officers.  A police spokesperson said that a group of about 20 Israelis entered the site after security checks. One of them said that the compound was relatively empty, with few Muslim visitors.  ""It is the first time we come here without being escorted by the Waqf (the Muslim authority that administrates the site). Usually, the Waqf people are all around us, today we are here alone,"" the visitor said.  It was the second day of Muslim protest against what they call a violation of the status quo in the flashpoint compound. On Monday, clashes errupted between worshippers and police outside the compound.  In a shooting attack on Friday morning, three Palestinian Muslims with Israeli citizenship shot dead two Israel policemen near the gates of the compound. The gunmen, all from the Arab city of Umm al-Fahm in central Israel, were subsequently shot and killed by the police.  Immediately after the incident, Israel shut down the compound, saying that security forces need to check the site for more militants or ammunition.  It was for the first time in the past 50 years that Israel closed the compound, which is Islam's third holiest site.  Israel reopened the holy site on Sunday, requiring all visitors to go through security checks through metal detectors that were placed at two gates.  The Waqf, a Muslim religious authority that administrates the compound, rejected the new measures and refused to hold prayers at the mosque.  ""This is a gross violation of the status quo, a new reality that neither we nor the Arab street is willing to accept,"" the legal advisor of the Waqf, attorney Jamal Abu Toami, was quoted as saying by Army Radio.  Ir Amim, an Israeli human rights group, warned that the new measures, including the two-day closure of the site, have ""disturbing implications for a status quo.""  According to a statement issued by the group, Israeli security forces made ""unilateral decisions"" about access to the compound without the participation of the Waqf, establishing ""a clear change to the status quo.""  The introduction of metal detectors and security checks ""imposes Israeli sovereignty in violation of arrangements established and respected since 1967,"" the organisation said, urging leaders to take steps ""as soon as possible to restore cooperation between Israeli security forces and the Waqf.""  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he had decided to reopen the site with increased security measures but promised to ""maintain the status-quo.""  Israel seized East Jerusalem, where al-Aqsa is located, along with the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip during the 1967 Middle East war. Israel subsequently annexed East Jerusalem, claiming it part of its ""eternal and indivisible"" capital, in a move never recognised internationally.  The compound site is holy to both Muslims and Jews.  Due to the special sensitivity, the Muslim Waqf is responsible for the administration of the site. Israeli Jews are allowed to visit the site but not to pray there.  In recent months, far-right Israeli lawmakers renewed their calls to change the long-held status quo and to lift the restrictions on Jewish prays, escalating the tensions in and around the compound.  -- BERNAMA",en,terrorattack,12,"['As', 'Israel', 'Israel']"

Oversight of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the police force were the responsibility of three government officials. They will now be handled by Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton under the new Home Affairs Ministry, Mr Turnbull said, citing a model similar to that used by the British Home Office.  Mr Turnbull said the centralised model would ensure greater coordination between AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security agencies. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is driven by operational logic. Our security environment is being shaped by changes in our region and beyond,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told reporters in Canberra.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is being shaped by the very real threat of homegrown terrorism that is increased with the spread of global Islamist terrorism.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Mr Turnbull said the United KingdomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Home Office, rather than the United States Department of Homeland Security, provided the template for the ministry, which would be small enough to be nimble and would be consistent with arrangements made by other Ã¢â‚¬Å“Five EyesÃ¢â‚¬Â intelligence partners including New Zealand and Canada.  The new ministry will need legislative changes to be implemented, he added.  The national security overhaul Ã¢â‚¬â€ AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest security shake-up in more than 40 years Ã¢â‚¬â€ came as the country, a staunch ally of the US, reshapes its counter-terrorism response after a series of lone-wolf attacks and heightened fear of attacks by homegrown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East.  The shake-up came a day after Mr Turnbull said AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military would be more readily deployed to respond to Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorist incidentsÃ¢â‚¬Â at home.  Under those proposed law changes, state and territory governments would be able to call for military help at any time after a Ã¢â‚¬Å“terror incidentÃ¢â‚¬Â has been declared.  Previously, the military could only be called upon once police concluded they could no longer deal with an incident.  Canberra raised the terror threat alert level in September 2014 and introduced new national security laws amid concerns of attacks by individuals inspired by organisations such as the Islamic State (IS).  Counter-terrorism police have also made a string of arrests since late 2014 across the nation and say they have prevented 12 terror attacks on home soil in the past few years.  But several attacks have taken place, including a cafe siege in 2014 where two hostages were killed and the murder of a Sydney police employee in 2015 by a 15-year-old boy.  A coronial inquiry found in May that the police failed to respond quickly enough to end the cafe siege, which has been described as AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadliest incident inspired by IS extremists. The gunman, who was killed by the police, had no direct ties to the militant group. AGENCIES",en,terrorattack,20,['Australia']

There have been nightly confrontations between Palestinians hurling rocks and Israeli police using stun grenades in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem since the devices were placed on Sunday at entrances to the Temple Mount-Noble Sanctuary compound.  Tensions remain high ahead of Friday prayers when thousands of Muslims usually flock to al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, in the compound above Judaism's sacred Western Wall.  Muslim religious authorities, who say the metal detectors violate a delicate agreement on worship and security arrangements at the site, have been urging Palestinians not to pass through, and prayers have been held near an entrance to the complex.  Ismail Haniyeh, leader of the Hamas Islamist movement that rules Gaza, called on Palestinian demonstrators to confront Israeli troops along the enclave's border on Friday in protest at the Israeli measure.  Netanyahu was due to hold security consultations over the issue, and likely decide on a course of action, on his return to Israel later in the day from visits to France and Hungary, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said.  Advertisement Advertisement  Far-right members of Netanyahu's government have publicly urged him to keep the devices in place at the flashpoint site, but Israeli media reports said security chiefs were divided over the issue amid concerns of wider protests in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  ""The prime minister is considering whether to change this decision, and that's his prerogative,"" Erdan said on Army Radio. He described the equipment as a legitimate security measure.  Last Friday, three Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli policemen outside the Temple Mount-Noble Sanctuary complex in one of the most serious attacks in the area in years. The assailants were killed by security forces.  Israel briefly closed the compound, holy to Jews as the site of biblical temples, and install the metal detectors which it said were commonplace at religious sites worldwide.  Israel captured East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital.

The operation targeted insurgents from the Nusra Front group in the mountainous outskirts of the Lebanese town of Arsal and areas near the Syrian town of Fleita, the commander said.  Media run by Hezbollah reported significant gains by its side the early stage of the operation.  A Lebanese security source said refugees living in the area were fleeing towards Arsal and the Lebanese army was facilitating their passage with U.N. supervision. It was not yet clear how many refugees were on the move, the source said.  Several thousand Syrian refugees occupy camps east of the town in an area known as Juroud Arsal, a barren mountainous zone between Syria and Lebanon that has served as a base for Islamic State militants, jihadists and other rebels fighting in Syria's six year civil war.  Hezbollah's al-Manar TV said Nusra militants were under attack in Juroud Arsal and in areas near the Syrian town of Fleita. Al-Manar broadcast footage showing an artillery gun being fired from the back of a truck flying the Hezbollah flag. Plumes of smoke were shown rising from the hills.  Hezbollah, a Shi'ite group backed by Iran, has played a critical part in previous campaigns against insurgents along the border, part of the much wider role it has played supporting President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian war.  The Lebanese army is not taking part in the operation, the commander in the pro-Damascus military alliance and the Lebanese security source said. The Lebanese source said the army had assumed a defensive position, was monitoring militant movements, and would fire if it came under attack.  The Lebanese National News Agency later reported that the army had fired on a group of militants trying to flee the fighting towards Arsal town.  ARMY REINFORCEMENTS  The Lebanese army, a recipient of U.S. and British military support, deployed reinforcements on the outskirts of Arsal in anticipation of the operation this week to prevent militants from crossing into Lebanon.  Hezbollah's role in the Syrian war has been a major point of contention in Lebanon, facing criticism from opponents including Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. Hariri's Future Movement on Thursday said the anticipated Arsal battle was part of ""the services"" offered by Hezbollah to ""the Syrian regime"".  Hariri said on Tuesday the Lebanese army would carry out a carefully planned operation in the Juroud Arsal area, but there was no coordination between it and the Syrian army.  The Nusra Front was al Qaeda's official affiliate in the Syrian civil war until last year when it formally severed ties to al Qaeda and renamed itself. The group now spearheads the Tahrir al-Sham Islamist alliance.  In 2014, Arsal was the scene of one of the most serious spillovers of the Syrian war into Lebanon, when jihadists briefly overran the town.  Negotiations failed to secure the militants' withdrawal from the Juroud Arsal area to other rebel-held parts of Syria.  Earlier this month, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said time was running out for Syrian militants along the border near Arsal to reach deals with Syrian authorities, saying it was ""high time to end the threat of militant groups in Arsal"".

Aung San Suu Kyi came to power last year after a landslide in the landmark 2015 elections.  She does not oversee the police or the military, which ruled the country for decades and retains its powerful position under a constitution drafted by the former junta.  Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee told a news conference at the conclusion of her 12-day visit that she faced ""increasing restrictions"" on her access.  Lee said the government, citing security concerns, had prevented her from visiting parts of the northeast where the military is accused of abuses against civilians in its conflict with ethnic rebels.  She was also not allowed to visit three journalists detained last month by the army and charged with contacting a rebel group, despite the site of their detention being a popular tourist spot, the human rights envoy said.  Suu Kyi's spokesman Zaw Htay was not immediately available for comment late on Friday.  Myanmar regularly blocks monitors and journalists from travelling to areas near the conflicts citing concerns over safety. Security officials say monitoring prominent people is a normal part of their work.  Lee said it was ""unacceptable"" that people meeting her were watched and even followed by agents she suspected to be from the police Special Branch that once stalked political opponents during almost half a century of dictatorship.  BIRTH CERTIFICATES  ""I have to say I am disappointed to see the tactics applied by the previous government still being used,"" she said.  ""In the previous times, human rights defenders, journalists and civilians were followed, monitored and surveyed and questioned. That's still going on,"" Lee added.  Myanmar is also refusing entry to a separate U.N. fact-finding mission appointed by the Human Rights Council in Geneva to look into allegations of abuses by the security forces.  The panel has a special focus on the western state of Rakhine, where the army led an operation late last year in response to attacks by militants caused an estimated 75,000 people Rohingya Muslims flee across the border to Bangladesh.  About 1.1 million Rohingya - who many in Myanmar view as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh - live are denied citizenship and face restrictions on their movements in Rakhine.  Lee visited the state and credited Myanmar for attempts to implement some recommendations made in March by a advisory panel led by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, including the issuing of birth certificates to 20,000 children not previously registered.  Buddhist officials in Muslim-majority areas have in the past refused to draw up such documents for Rohingya newborns.  However, Lee said: ""The general situation for the Rohingya has hardly improved since my last visit in January and has become further complicated in the north of Rakhine.""  Continued alleged abuses by security forces and killings by suspected Rohingya militants of those perceived to be working with the government left many Rohingya ""terrified and often caught between violence on both sides"", she said.

About 80,000 people a year have the kinds of blood cancers that the first round of new treatments can fight, out of the 1.7 million cases of cancer diagnosed annually in the United States.  The new treatments are expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and they come with risks. Patients in the earliest studies nearly died from side effects like raging fever, low blood pressure and lung congestion. Doctors have learned how to control those reactions, but experts also have concerns about possible long-term effects like second cancers that could in theory be caused by the disabled viruses used in genetic engineering. No such cancers have been seen so far, but it is too soon to tell.  Photo  The new leukemia treatment involves removing millions of white blood cells called T cells Ã¢â‚¬â€ often referred to as the soldiers of the immune system Ã¢â‚¬â€ from the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bloodstream, genetically engineering them to recognize and kill cancer, multiplying them and then infusing them back into the patient. The process is expensive because each treatment has to be made separately for each person.  Solid tumors are less amenable to T-cell treatment Ã¢â‚¬â€ which scientists call CAR-T Ã¢â‚¬â€ but studies at various centers are trying find to find ways to use it against mesothelioma and cancers of the ovary, breast, prostate, pancreas and lung.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“These solid tumors are like Fort Knox,Ã¢â‚¬Â Dr. Grupp said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to let the T cells in. We need combination approaches, CAR-T plus something else, but until the something else is defined weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not doing to see the same kind of responses.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The pioneering T-cell therapy for leukemia was created at the University of Pennsylvania, which licensed it to Novartis. The FDA panel recommended company approval of it for a narrow subset of severely ill patients, only a few hundred a year in the United States: those ages 3 to 25 who have B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has relapsed or not responded to the standard treatments. Those patients have poor odds of surviving, but in clinical trials, a single T-cell treatment has produced long remissions in many and possibly even cured some.  Novartis plans to request another approval later this year of the same treatment for adults who have a type of lymphoma Ã¢â‚¬â€ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has relapsed or resisted treatment. A competitor, Kite Pharma, has also filed for approval of a T-cell treatment for lymphoma. Another competitor, Juno, suffered a setback when it shut down a T-cell study in adults after five patients died from brain swelling. Kite has also reported one such death.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Novartis is studying several other types of T-cells, with different genetic tweaks, to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma as well as glioblastoma.  Some of the more promising work so far involves efforts to make the existing gene treatments even more effective in blood cancers. For lymphoma patients, the T cells are being given along with a drug, ibrutinib, and the combination seems to work better than either treatment alone.  At the ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hospital of Philadelphia, there are not enough study spots for all the patients who hope to receive T-cell treatment, and the waiting time can stretch to months, longer than some can afford to wait. Waiting times should decline after the treatment is approved and becomes more widely available.  Dr. Grupp said that one encouraging avenue of research involved giving the T-cells at an earlier stage of the disease, instead of very late, as rules now require. He said a study was being planned at multiple centers that he hoped would start within the next six months or so. The patients would be children with early signs that the usual chemotherapy Ã¢â‚¬â€ which cures many Ã¢â‚¬â€ is not working well for them.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We could deploy the treatment considerably earlier and before they get so sick,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. He added, Ã¢â‚¬Å“That is another big step in terms of trying to figure out how to use these cells appropriately.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Children with less advanced disease also tend to have milder side effects from the T-cell treatment.  Studies in children are also underway to combine T-cell treatment with the immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which help unleash the cancer-killing power of T cells. There will be many such studies, Dr. Grupp predicted, but, he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early days.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The T cells in the Novartis products, and in the earliest ones its competitors are developing, have been engineered to seek and destroy cells that display a protein called CD19 on their surfaces Ã¢â‚¬â€ a characteristic of many leukemias and lymphomas.  Identifying other targets would be a boon, Dr. Grupp said, because sometimes leukemic cells lacking CD19 proliferate, escape the treatment and cause relapse.  Photo  Another target is being studied, and Dr. Grupp said the next step, which he called Ã¢â‚¬Å“super important,Ã¢â‚¬Â would be to attack two targets in the same patient.

Instead of using T cells, the team uses natural killer cells, another component of the immune system, one that has a powerful ability to fight anything it recognizes as foreign. Instead of extracting the cells from patients, the researchers, Dr. Katy Rezvani and Dr. Elizabeth Shpall, remove the natural killers from samples of umbilical-cord blood donated by women who have just given birth.  They use natural killer cells because T cells from one person cannot be safely given to another, lest they attack the hostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tissue, causing graft-versus-host disease, which can be fatal. Natural killer cells do not cause that deadly reaction, so it is safe to use such cells from a newbornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cord blood to treat patients.  The natural killer cells are genetically engineered to attack CD19, and also to produce a substance that activates them and helps them persist in the body. They also have an Ã¢â‚¬Å“off switch,Ã¢â‚¬Â a gene that will let the researchers shut down the cells with a certain drug if they cause dangerous side effects that cannot be controlled.  After promising studies in mice, the researchers have opened a study for adults with relapsed or treatment-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The first patient was to be treated this week, Dr. Rezvani said.  One unit of cord blood yields enough cells to treat five patients, she said, and in two weeks the natural killer cells can be expanded 500-fold, to a billion cells.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We plan to make the product and infuse it fresh to the patient, but we are also working on optimizing the freezing process so we can make the product, freeze it and keep it, so that when patients need it, we can give it.Ã¢â‚¬Â",en,diseas,,

Buses carrying Syrians have begun leaving refugee camps in the Lebanese border area of Jroud Arsal under a truce deal between Lebanon's Hezbollah and Syrian Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters.  Thousands of Syrians, including fighters, their families and refugees, are to leave the border zone and head for Syria's Idlib province under the agreement.  The Lebanese Al Manar television station said on Wednesday that 26 buses crossed further northeast from the Arsal area to Wadi Hmeid, in the direction of the Syrian border.  Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Labweh, said the logistics of the long convoy would be challenging.  ""The Lebanese Red Cross will escort this convoy to the border with Syria,"" he said.  ""They will then be met by the Syrian Red Crescent, which will escort the convoy to Idlib province, a rebel-held area.  ""That is where these refugees, these fighters and their families will be going, but we understand this could take many many hours.""  Nearly 7,000 Syrians are expected to leave the area under the ceasefire deal, according to Hezbollah-run news media outlets.  The deal also included the release of Hezbollah fighters by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front, which took place overnight.  The ceasefire took effect last week, just days after Hezbollah and the Syrian army launched an offensive to drive Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and other armed groups from their last foothold along the Syria-Lebanon border.  Figures disputed  Security sources say that about 1,000 Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters are among those who will leave the area for Idlib aboard dozens of buses.  However, in an interview to Al Jadeed, a Lebanon-based TV station seen as close to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a Lebanese General Security official estimated the number of fighters to be much lower.

The deadly attack near Bagram Airbase comes at the peak of the Taliban summer fighting season and just a day after the insurgent group killed two US soldiers in the restive southern province of Kandahar.  ""One Resolute Support Soldier was killed and six personnel (five troops and one interpreter) were wounded Thursday evening when their patrol was attacked by a suicide bomber,"" Nato said in a statement referring to the name of its Afghan mission.  ""The patrol was conducting a partnered mission with the Afghan National Army when a personnel-borne IED (improvised explosive device) detonated,"" in Qarabagh district in Kabul province.  ""The RS personnel who were wounded are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airfield. All of the wounded are listed in stable condition,"" it added.  The nationality of the dead soldier and injured was not immediately known but Qarabagh district is located near Bagram Airbase, the largest American base in Afghanistan, around 50 kilometres north of the capital Kabul.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The Taliban quickly claimed the attack on social media and in Whatsapp messages to journalists.  Civilians were also reported to have been wounded in the nighttime attack.  ""#Afghanistan explosion in Qarabagh district, 12 wounded brought to our #Kabul hospital so far,"" tweeted an Italian-run hospital in the capital which specialises in dealing with victims of bombings.  The attack came after two US soldiers died on Wednesday when a Taliban suicide bomber rammed a vehicle filled with explosives into a convoy of foreign forces in the big poppy-growing region of Kandahar.  NATO forces ended their more than a decade-long combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of 2014.  Since then Afghan troops and police, beset by soaring casualties, have struggled to beat back the resurgent Taliban, while facing the growing menace of the Islamic State group.  The Taliban have been ramping up their campaign against beleaguered government forces, underscoring rising insecurity in the country during the summer fighting season, when the warmer weather tends to spur an increase in militant attacks.  Early last month a US soldier was killed and two others wounded in an attack in Kandahar's neighbouring Helmand province while conducting operations against the Taliban.  The attacks come as United States President Donald Trump weighs sending more American troops to Afghanistan nearly 16 years after the US invasion to topple the Taliban regime.  US troops in Afghanistan now number about 8,400, and there are another 5,000 from NATO allies, a far cry from the US presence of more than 100,000 six years ago. They mainly serve as trainers and advisers.  American military commanders in Afghanistan have requested thousands of extra boots on the ground and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis is believed to be close to presenting a new US military strategy for Afghanistan to Trump.",en,terrorattack,43,['Afghanistan']

But Muslim clan leader Norodin Lucman refused Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he could not tell them the reason, which was that he was giving refuge to a group of civilians whose lives would surely be forfeit if they were found by the extremist rebels.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I cannot tell them that I have Christians in my house for fear that somebody might get wind of the information and tell the ISIS (group),Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mr Norodin, who refused to abandon them.  It was the initial days of the rebellion in Marawi launched by extremists under the black flag of ISIS, and the rebels were executing Christians they came across.  In the midst of the bloodshed, stories have emerged of Muslims Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who form the majority in the southern Philippine city - putting their lives on the line to protect Christians and to help any desperate souls seeking escape from the bombing by government troops and shooting.  Surviving civilians in Marawi have been caught in the cross fire between the extremists and government military bombs and bullets.  Advertisement  Advertisement  When the extremist militants first stormed into Marawi in late May, days before Ramadan, Mr Norodin thought the fighting would be over in just a couple of days.  So he told the group hiding in his house to Ã¢â‚¬Å“stay put, relaxÃ¢â‚¬Â. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nothing will happen to you while IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m here,Ã¢â‚¬Â he assured them.  But the fighting dragged on, with several close calls Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like the time the rebels came knocking on his door. Fortunately their leader knew him as a respected community leader.  DIE OF HUNGER, OR RISK GETTING SHOT  On the twelfth day, they ran out of food and water. Staying put was no longer an option.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come what may, because these people were going to die of hunger - rather than ISIS bullets or military bombs - I had to make a decision,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mr Norodin.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“After dawn prayers, I woke them up and said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLet's get ready, we are going to break outÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.Ã¢â‚¬Â  He instructed the men to carry the children and the women to dress like Muslims with their heads covered, so that they would look like families. And he told them to keep shouting Ã¢â‚¬Å“AllahuakbarÃ¢â‚¬Â (Allah is great, in Arabic).  The carnage in downtown Marawi. It looked ""like Aleppo,"" said Mr Norodin.  It was a long and terrifying walk to get to the other side of town across a bridge, with snipers on the rooftops watching them intently.  As they reached the mouth of the bridge, a militant blocked his path. It turned out to be a young man he knew. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He motioned to his partners, on the other side of the bridge, to let us pass.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“And I was so glad that he recognised me. Because if not, then I don't know what would happen,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.

KILLING THOSE WHO CANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T RECITE THE KORAN  In the centre of the city, five Muslim police officers found themselves protecting five Christian construction workers who got caught in the crossfire with the rebels.  Their situation was getting desperate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ under threat from the extremists and from their own military, who warned them that they were going to bomb the place.  Police officer Lumla Lidasan said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We were surrounded. We didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know there were so many ISIS (members) around here.

DAMASCUS: A senior Syrian government minister on Sunday dismissed as a ""joke"" plans by the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria to hold elections and said they would not be allowed to threaten the country's territorial unity.  Deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad also said the Syrian government must eventually assert control over Kurdish-led areas, which until now Damascus has tolerated in an uneasy relationship.  "" will be a joke. Syria will never ever allow any part of its territory to be separated,"" Mekdad said in Damascus in an interview with Reuters and the BBC.  Syria's multi-sided conflict has turned the country into a patchwork of areas controlled by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, various rebel groups, Islamic State militants and Kurdish-led groups.  Kurdish groups and their allies control swathes of the north in areas held by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of militias spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG.  At the end of July the Kurdish-led administration there set dates between late summer and January for local council and regional assembly elections in a move apparently aimed at consolidating its growing autonomy.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The Kurdish groups have carved out self-governing regions since early in the six-year conflict, but they say they are not seeking independence from Damascus.  ""We believe that in the north of Syria we have Syrian citizens who will not endanger the situation in the country or move ahead to any manifestation of dividing Syria. Those who will move in those directions know what price they have to pay,"" Mekdad said.  When asked if the Syrian government was willing to take back control of areas now controlled by Kurdish groups he said: ""It is not a matter of 'willing' it is a matter of 'must'.""  ""The territorial integrity of Syria will never be under dispute,"" he said.  Mekdad said it was the responsibility of the international community to maintain Syria's unity.  He reiterated Damascus's regular call for external countries to stop funding groups fighting in the conflict.  He also urged the United States to stop its activities inside Syria, saying he believed its actions were illegal and were costing ""thousand of lives"".  A U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State supports the SDF with air strikes and other military assistance in its fight to oust the hardline jihadist group from Syria.  The coalition, which investigates reports of civilian deaths as a result of its campaign against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, said in early July at least 600 civilians had been killed in its air strikes in the two countries since the operation began in 2014.

515279,foxnews,Deb Riechmann,Inmates serving terror-related sentences slated for release,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/yvyYGPJoIeI/convicts-in-prison-for-terror-offenses-slated-for-release.html,,7/8/2017 17:07,"Dozens of convicts serving time in U.S. prisons for terrorism-related offenses are due to be released in the next several years, raising the question of whether that's something Americans should fear.  Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States has worked aggressively to foil attacks and imprison hundreds of people who joined or helped militant groups. Experts say less attention has been paid to what happens once those prisoners complete their sentences and re-enter American society.  Among the incarcerated, according to the Bureau of Prisons, are 380 linked to international terrorism and 83 tied to domestic terrorism. A Congressional Research Service report said 50 ""homegrown violent jihadists"" were to be released between last January and the end of 2026.  Most of those convicted of terrorism-related crimes are held at the high-security U.S. penitentiary in Florence, Colorado, and federal prisons in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Marion, Illinois. Some are in for life, but the average sentence is 13 years. That means most will walk out of prison with years of freedom ahead.  ""There were people I was with in prison who you'd be happy to have as a neighbor because they were normal, reasonable people,"" said Ismail Royer. He was released last December after serving more than 13 years on firearms charges connected to his work helping others get to a militant training camp in Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan territory claimed by India and Pakistan.  ""The guys that I'm really, really concerned about are the loose cannons,"" Royer said.  Royer grew up in a Catholic family in suburban St. Louis. By the time he was 21, he had converted to Islam and was fighting alongside fellow Muslims in Bosnia. At 31, he was serving a 20-year sentence.  Today, he lives in the Washington, D.C., area, works for the Center for Islam and Religious Freedom and wants to help nonextremist Muslim-Americans find their footing in American society.  Behind bars, Royer got to know inmates arrested for only loose ties to terrorism. But he also met Richard Reid, the al-Qaida ""shoe bomber,"" and John Walker Lindh, an American captured in Afghanistan while fighting with the Taliban.  Some were ensnared in sting operations, Royer said, or were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Others were up to no good; Royer said he was happy the FBI arrested them.  ""At any time, the loose cannon might go to the convenience store and cut off somebody's head. You just don't know. These guys are very problematic,"" Royer said while eating grilled cheese at a hotel not far from the White House. ""I don't want them as my neighbor. You can't sit there and talk to them and tell them that their views are mistaken.""  Eric Rosand, a senior fellow in the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World at Brookings Institution and director of The Prevention Project: Organizing Against Violent Extremism based in Washington, said not enough is known about the mindset of the prisoners being released. Experts say there's been no comprehensive research to determine recidivism rates for these individuals.  And more are expected to enter prison.  Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump in May, had told Congress that the bureau had more than 900 active investigations related to Islamic State and other extremist activity in all 50 states.  Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University's School of Law, doesn't think the public should panic.  Individuals convicted of the most serious terrorism-related offenses will not ever walk free, she said. Many of those released after serving time for lesser offenses will face months to years of supervision, she said. Phone calls and online communications are monitored. Travel can be restricted. Weekly meetings with counselors can be required.  ""We're not talking about 9/11 perpetrators,"" Greenberg said.  While the State Department has spent more than $10 million since 2012 to help other countries deal with an increase in suspected terrorists, Rosand lamented that no similar effort is taking place here.  ""People have to go back to some community once they are released,"" said Rosand, a former senior counterterrorism official at the State Department. ""Are we preparing communities for their release? Where are they going to go? Is the community that they came from going to accept them back?""  Patrick James, a researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said the U.S. lags behind European and Middle Eastern countries in finding ways to address paths to radicalization or ease the return of released individuals.  ""There's no net to catch them. There is no way to make sure they don't re-engage in extremism,"" James said.  At least 128 individuals have been charged in the United States with crimes related specifically to the Islamic State group since March 2014, when the first arrests were made, according to George Washington University's Program on Extremism.  Justice Department officials declined comment.  But the department's internal watchdog is auditing the Bureau of Prisons' procedures, policies and practices for monitoring inmates with known or suspected terrorist ties, and efforts to prevent further radicalization among inmates.  The issue also is being addressed in pockets of the country.  Last year, U.S. District Judge Michael Davis in Minneapolis announced a new program to assess the risks posed by terrorism defendants and devise plans to help them re-evaluate their extremist ideals so they don't engage in similar activities again.  Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S. and has been a target for extremist recruiters. About a dozen Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to join militant groups in recent years. At least 22 men from Minnesota's Somali community have join al-Shabab in Somalia in the past decade.  Davis' program enlists the help of Daniel Koehler, who runs an institute devoted to ""de-radicalization"" in Germany. Koehler will conduct risk assessments on terror offenders to give Davis more information as he determines sentences. Koehler will then train U.S. probation and pretrial officers, who will be responsible for supervising defendants.  ""I am not aware that any other court has tried something like that,"" Koehler said.  Royer, who served time in Terre Haute and elsewhere, offered some examples of those in line for release and their place on the terrorism spectrum.  One inmate, he said, was a former computer programmer from Yemen who was arrested for stealing proprietary software and trying to market it as his own. The inmate claimed he told U.S. officials he would give them the names of al-Qaida followers if they let him go.  ""He lied to them. He didn't know anyone from al-Qaida. He just told them some names and very quickly they found out that he was full of crap,"" Royer said. ""He went to prison for lying to the FBI and they put him in the terrorism unit.""  A second inmate was picked up selling night vision equipment to a U.S. law enforcement official posing as a member of Lebanon's Hezbollah. Royer said the inmate was trying to make a buck. He was charged with attempting to provide material support to a terrorist group and ended up in the terrorism unit at Terre Haute.  ""The only concern with him is that he's a hustler,"" Royer said. ""That's not to say that it's not a crime.""",en,terrorattack,,

A previous count by army chief General Jesus Suarez Chourio said that one died and one was gravely wounded in the attack on Sunday on the base in the northwestern city of Valencia, which the military said was quickly put down.  Maduro also said that 10 other men have escaped and authorities were hunting for them.  One of the attackers was badly wounded during the assault, army chief Chourio said.  The Venezuelan president said 20 men in all entered the Paramacay base shortly before 4am local time. He said soldiers assigned as night guards were caught by surprise and the intruders were able to work their way to the base's weapons supply.  The president said troops battled with the intruders for about four hours.  READ MORE: Venezuela crisis - What's next?

Diosdado Cabello, the Socialist Party's deputy, earlier said troops acted quickly to quash the assault.  Meanwhile, an opposition party official said that a local leader was shot dead at a protest near the military base. It is unclear, however, if Haydee Franco was referring to one of the two fatalities mentioned by Maduro.  Military officials said the rebels, whom they described as ""terrorists,"" were trying to steal weapons.  Earlier on Sunday, a small group of men dressed in military fatigues, some armed with assault rifles, released a video declaring an uprising in Carabobo state, where Valencia is located.  In the video, a man identifying himself as Captain Juan Caguaripano said that any unit refusing to go along with its call for rebellion would be declared a military target.  ""We demand the immediate formation of a transition government,"" Caguaripano said. He was flanked by about a dozen men in military uniforms.

The reported attack in Paramacay comes two days after government allies inaugurated a new legislative super body that the opposition and dozens of countries denounced as a power grab by President Nicolas Maduro.  In its first act on Saturday, the Constituent Assembly ordered the dismissal of the country's attorney general, Luisa Ortega, a vocal government critic.

Emergency measures have been put in place to protect those at the ""highest immediate risk"" and are expected to continue until 2018, the body said.  Doctors will assess which patients are the most in need and advise whether some treatment can be delayed.  PHE said the risk of catching hepatitis B in the UK remains very low.  People who have unprotected sex, inject drugs or have dental and medical care in high-risk countries are most vulnerable.  Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver, spread through blood and bodily fluids.  NHS Choices warns that it ""often doesn't cause any obvious symptoms"" and ""typically passes in a few months without treatment"".  Children can get serious liver damage if the infection persists for years.  Symptoms include tiredness, fever, loss of appetite, jaundice and feeling and being sick.

The clashes followed an attack by BDK members on Kinshasa's main prison and demonstrations by other members against Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila in Kinshasa, Matadi and the southwestern city of Boma, witnesses and security sources said.  A series of large-scale prison breaks across Congo in the past few months has aggravated insecurity since Kabila refused to step down after his mandate expired in December.  Assailants wearing red headbands characteristic of BDK members staged the attack on the high-security Makala prison but did not make it past the front door, said a witness inside the prison.  ""We woke up to the deafening noise of gunshots,"" said the witness, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. He said he had seen police and soldiers gather several bodies outside the prison walls.  BDK leader and self-styled prophet Ne Muanda Nsemi escaped from prison in May and had called on his supporters to rise up this Monday against Kabila, whom Nsemi accuses of being Rwandan - a common slur by the president's opponents.  The group aims to revive the pre-colonial Kongo kingdom, which thrived for centuries around the mouth of the Congo River.  BDK demonstrators on Monday held signs that read, ""Rwanda for Rwandans. Congo for Congolese. Get out, Kanambe,"" using another slur to refer to Kabila.  Police spokesman Pierrot Mwanamputu said in a statement that 12 BDK assailants in Kinshasa, armed with calibre-12 rifles and bladed weapons, were killed by ""stray bullets"" fired by security forces to disperse them. The attackers killed one policeman.  Two others were killed in the southwestern town of Matadi, where three police officers were also injured, he added.  One security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told Reuters that two army officers had been killed in Kinshasa.  Kinshasa police commissioner General Sylvano Kasongo told Reuters that no one escaped from the prison and the situation had been brought under control.  Around 4,000 prisoners, including Nsemi, escaped from Makala in May during an attack by suspected BDK members.  The mounting unrest has led some of Kabila's allies to call for a state of emergency. More than 50 people were killed on Friday in the southeast in inter-ethnic clashes, part of rising militia violence across the country. REUTERS",en,terrorattack,,

Last week's installation of an all-powerful new legislative body run by leftist President Nicolas Maduro's Socialist Party loyalists, despite massive protests and a global outcry, has left many Venezuelans feeling there are no more democratic options to oppose the government.  That sentiment may have helped trigger Sunday's raid on a military base near the city of Valencia by soldiers and armed civilians, in which the government said two people were killed. Venezuelan authorities say they are hunting 10 of the attackers who escaped with a cache of weapons.  In a pre-taped video, the group of more than a dozen men in military-style uniforms said they were seeking to restore constitutional order and called for Maduro to step aside in favour of a transitional government.  The raid has raised the spectre of a coup or a surge in already serious levels of violence in the country of 30 million as its slides further into an economic crisis and chaos.  Even before Sunday's attack, Maduro's consolidation of power had left many protesters disappointed with what they see as a quarrelsome and self-interested opposition coalition.  More than 120 people have been killed and thousands arrested in four months of unrest that failed to prevent last month's elections to the new constituent assembly.  Many hardliners felt betrayed as their leaders appeared to hesitate on strategy and postponed protests last week. The coalition's many political parties have also diverged over whether to take part in gubernatorial elections in December, especially after widespread accusations of fraud in the constituent assembly election.  For the hooded youths who block roads with iron metal sheets and debris - forming the militant fringe of an otherwise broadly peaceful protest movement - the fragmented opposition leadership is already history.  ""We have to stop believing in the opposition coalition. We can only believe in ourselves,"" said a young man from the Andean state of Tachira, who quit university to move to Caracas and join the protests,  The 20-year-old, whose face was covered with a T-shirt as he brandished a homemade petrol bomb, declined to give his name for fear of reprisal. A new public prosecutor, named by the constituent assembly in its first session on Saturday, has pledged to crack down hard on the demonstrators.  CONFLICT AHEAD?  Government repression, however, threatens to push militants within the protest movement underground and into the formation of paramilitary or rebel groups in a country awash with weapons, according to political analyst and pollster Luis Vicente Leon.  ""As the government radicalizes, these groups will tend to grow and the future could be full of conflict,"" Leon told Reuters.  He did not elaborate, but other analysts have also spoken of the threat of a low-intensity civil war in Venezuela barring some reversal in the country's current decline.  In what could be a harbinger of more violent tactics by protesters, an explosion wounded seven police officers on motorbikes during the election of the constituent assembly on July 30.  Maduro has said he is facing an ""armed insurrection"" designed to end socialism in Latin America and let a U.S.-backed business elite get its hands on the OPEC nation's massive crude reserves.  On the surface, at least, the prospect of a decisive military coup to oust the former union leader, who was narrowly elected in 2013 after being hand-picked by former President Hugo Chavez to succeed him, seems far off.  There have been no outward signs of any split between Maduro and the military leadership, which continues to publicly back him.  But the purported leader of Sunday's raid on the military base, fugitive former National Guard captain Juan Carlos Caguaripano, has called on his ""brothers in arms"" to disobey orders from military leaders.  And Oscar Perez, a rogue police pilot who attacked government buildings in a helicopter attack in Caracas in June, has said he is keeping up the fight while on the run.  ""We support the military uprisings,"" said Maria Rodriguez, 35, a cheese seller who was blocking roads in Caracas' wealthier Altamira district on Sunday. ""We citizens can't do this alone.""  DEMORALIZED PROTESTERS  Many of her fellow opposition supporters, however, are exhausted after four months of street demonstrations and disruptions to daily life, which ultimately failed to make Maduro accept opposition demands.  Turnout at marches called by the opposition has fizzled in the last few weeks, and some people just want to return to work quickly in the country plagued with empty food shelves, runaway inflation and a fourth straight year of recession.  The opposition's attempt at a recall referendum against Maduro was scuttled by authorities last year. The opposition-led congress has been effectively neutralized and the Supreme Court, stacked with Maduro's Socialist Party allies, has been fully supportive of a leftist leader the United States and others call a ""dictator.""  Opposition leaders have long been seen as out of touch with ordinary Venezuelans, and the country's growing number of poor people, but they continue urging unity and hope for the future.  ""These 130 days of struggle have not been in vain,"" said Julio Borges, the president of the opposition-governed congress, over the weekend. ""Don't be demoralized. Don't think the government is winning: What the government is doing is destroying itself.""

But it is also possible that nurses inured to shortages might have held back free drugs from patients who were not seriously ill or who appeared able to buy the drugs elsewhere.  The study, published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, looked at more than 500,000 patient visits to rural or urban clinics in five African countries and Afghanistan.  Over all, 75 percent of the patients got malaria drugs or an antibiotic, regardless of their test results.

In most sites, between 40 to 80 percent of those who did not have malaria got antibiotics, even though the majority probably had viral infections, which antibiotics do not help. The best treatment is usually rest, fluids and a mild fever-reducing drug.  One advanced study in Zanzibar looking into all causes of fever found that only about 22 percent were bacterial, Dr. Hopkins said. But complex testing in poor countries is impossible, so doctors and nurses often offer antibiotics to sick patients just in case the cause is bacterial.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We definitely canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t blame them for doing that,Ã¢â‚¬Â Dr. Hopkins said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some of these patients are mothers who bring their kids in from 20 kilometers away on motorcycles or in minibuses. You can certainly understand why a health care worker would be reluctant to just send them home with a pat on the head and advice to take paracetamol and drink fluids.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The study was part of a long effort paid for by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to investigate how artemisinin, a malaria drug invented in China and introduced about 15 years ago, could be widely used Ã¢â‚¬â€ but not overused.  Malaria experts hope to slow down the emergence of artemisinin-resistant strains. Deaths from malaria have dropped 60 percent since 2000, partly because the drugs are so effective Ã¢â‚¬â€ but resistant parasites are turning up, especially in Southeast Asia.  In 2010, the World Health Organization strongly endorsed rapid malaria tests, and now more than 300 million are used each year.

Israeli forces arrested some 1,268 Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories over the last two months, according to rights groups.  Several non-governmental organisations, including the Ramallah-based Addameer prisoner rights group and al-Mezan rights centre in Gaza, released the figures in a joint press release published on Tuesday.  In June, the arrest of 388 Palestinians from across the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem, including 70 children and six women was documented.  In July, Israeli forces proceeded to arrest an additional 880 Palestinians, including 144 children and 18 women.  The rise in arrests intensified after the al-Aqsa crisis in occupied East Jerusalem, which began on July 14, after two Israeli guards were killed by three Palestinian citizens of Israel, who were shot dead.  More than 550 Palestinians were arrested over the past two months from Jerusalem alone.  ""The reason why the number got higher in July is because of al-Aqsa uprising. Israelis started a mass arrest campaign during and following al-Aqsa events, which mainly targeted Palestinians from Jerusalem and the West Bank,"" Laith Abu Zeyad, Addameer's international advocacy officer, told Al Jazeera  ""The number is definitely the highest in 2017, but I would [also] say the highest in years.""  According to Abu Zeyad, in October 2015, Israeli occupation forces arrested 1,195 Palestinians, including 177 children and 16 women.  READ MORE: Israeli measures at al-Aqsa will 'increase resistance'  The attack on al-Aqsa came against the backdrop of what has been termed the ""Jerusalem Intifada (uprising)"", which began in October 2015. Since then, some 285 Palestinians have died in alleged attacks, protests and raids. Simultaneously, 47 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians in car-ramming and knife attacks.  Following the attack, Israel responded by installing metal detectors and surveillance cameras at the entrances to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which was seen by Palestinians as an Israeli attempt to impose further control on the holy site.  For more than two weeks, Palestinians refused to enter al-Aqsa Mosque compound and resorted to praying outside, spurring a civil disobedience movement and international pressure that forced Israel to remove the added measures.  But since the removal, Israeli forces have been targeting Palestinians across the occupied territories in nightly raids and arrests, which rights groups describe as a form of collective punishment and revenge for the Israeli retreat from its position surrounding al-Aqsa.  ""Israel's campaign of arrest, whether it be in times of crisis or times of relative peace, is always a political tool and a form of collective punishment. It represents a premeditated policy of discouraging Palestinian political involvement, and an attempt to stop a people who are pursuant of their legitimate right to both self-determination and basic dignity,"" said Abu Zeyad.  ""The current wave of arrests has been centred on Jerusalem and attempts to halt the spread of protests and activism throughout the West Bank. Such arrests represent collective punishment against a people who peacefully call for the Israeli authorities to maintain the status quo at the holy site,"" he added.  Amina al-Taweel, spokesperson for the Hebron-based Palestinian Prisoners Center for Studies, says the average figure of Palestinians arrested per day stands at about 20 to 25 over the past two months, with some days reaching over 150 during the al-Aqsa crisis.  ""Some of those arrested were sent back home in the same day, others after a week, while some others were given house arrest orders. About 70 percent of the more than 1,000 are still in detention,"" Taweel told Al Jazeera.  ""It has become a systematic tool for oppression, to suppress any political backlash, to foil any attacks; there is not one clear reason for these arrests,"" Taweel added. ""Any one who has the potential to spur disobedience or to unify Palestinians for their cause is treated as a security threat, so they go after him or her.""  Taweel estimated there were 170 orders for administrative detention last month alone. Administrative detainees are arrested on ""secret evidence"", unaware of the accusations against them and are not allowed to defend themselves in court. Their detention periods can be indefinitely renewed.  READ MORE: What it means to be a Palestinian prisoner in Israel  The arrests come in various forms, but mostly during night raids. ""The period from 12am to 3am, at sunrise, is when everyone becomes nervous, especially when there is a sensitive political environment.  The occupation army surrounds the town and raids it. They break into the homes, sometimes by blowing up the entrance if the door is locked, they wreck the furniture and search the house. They usually put the family in one room and interrogate the person they're after in another room, and then detain him or her,"" explained Taweel.  Other forms of arrests take place during crackdowns by Israeli forces during protests or confrontations with Palestinians. Israeli forces, posing as Arabs - known as ""mistaarivim"" in Hebrew - also arrest Palestinians by assimilating with them in their towns and villages.  Umm Firas, a mother whose son, Mohammed, was recently arrested and released from the neighbourhood of Silwan in occupied East Jerusalem, said Israeli forces detained her son twice over the past three weeks.  ""In the latest arrest, they came in the evening for the first time. We were sitting together and they took him from me. They handcuffed him at the entrance to the house,"" Umm Firas told Al Jazeera. ""They arrested him and took him to court the next day, but found no evidence of anything against him.""  ""They come in without even knocking on the door. The way they come into the house is very violent. They come armed from head to toe in a very barbaric way. More than 15 [soldiers] come into the house, each one with their hand on the rifle,"" said Umm Firas, describing the way the Israeli forces arrested her son.  ""People were coming over to congratulate him over his release - and then they arrested him again - his grandmother was going to faint,"" added Umm Firas, saying they also took her 71-year-old sister's husband in Hebron.  ""They don't want people to defend al-Aqsa.""  Source: Al Jazeera",en,terrorattack,,

JAKARTA: Indonesian police on Friday arrested an alleged recruiter and fundraiser for pro-Islamic State (IS) militants locked in a bloody battle for control of the southern Philippine city of Marawi.  Nearly 700 people, 120 soldiers among them, have been killed in the conflict after an alliance of militant groups launched an audacious assault to capture the Philippine city on May 23.  Philippine military and police have yet to regain control of all of Marawi, a city of about 200,000 people, amid ferocious urban fighting that has destroyed most of its center.  The man detained at a residential complex on the outskirts of Jakarta is believed to be a member of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian radical group that has pledged allegiance to IS, police spokesman Inspector General Setyo Wasisto said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He finds people to send to Marawi and Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â Wasisto said in a text message to Reuters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“How many is still unclear.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Police also suspect he raised funds for recruitment.  Indonesian counter-terrorism authorities believe at least 20 Indonesians were among the fighters, along with some from Malaysia and the Middle East, who flocked to Marawi, on the island of Mindanao, long afflicted by Islamist insurgencies.  Indonesian JAD members make up most of the senior leadership of the Southeast Asian military unit fighting for IS in Syria known as Katibah Nusantara.  Two of the leaders, Bahrumsyah and Bahrun Naim, have directed and inspired a series of militant attacks in Indonesia, Indonesian police say.  Members of Katibah Nusantara have also organized funding and international recruits for the Marawi assault, the Jakarta-based Institute of Policy Analysis of Conflict said in a report.  Southeast Asian nations have vowed to step up law enforcement and intelligence cooperation to fight the rising threat of violent Islamist extremism in the wake of the Marawi siege.

The killings happened in the jihadist-held northwestern town of Sarmin, six miles (9km) east of the city of Idlib.  The group, officially called Syria Civil Defence (SCD), was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize last year for its work pulling civilian victims of bombing in Syria out of rubble.  It was active in rebel-held eastern Aleppo before the territory was seized by forces loyal to President Bashar al Assad.  Image: SCD volunteers watch as colleagues bury their fellow comrades during a funeral in Sarmin  The SCD receives millions of pounds worth of funding from many Western government including the UK and the US.  The White Helmets said in a statement: ""The civil defence centre in Sarmin was the target of an armed attack by unknown assailants in which seven volunteers were killed.  ""Two minibuses, some white helmets and walkie-talkies were stolen.""  It was not immediately clear whether the raid was carried out for political or criminal motives.

The observatory's director, Rami Abdel Rahman, said: ""Colleagues came in the morning for the change of shift and found them dead.""  The White Helmets emerged in 2013, working to rescue civilians in many rebel-held areas.  They have since gained widespread international renown for their daring rescues, with footage often taken and circulated on social media.  Video: Child rescued from rubble after airstrike  Although its volunteers work in exclusively rebel-held areas, the group insists it is not partisan.  President Bashar al Assad's government, meanwhile, accuses the group of faking videos and being a tool of its international donors.

There has been no case of human transmission but the virus prompted a cull of 200,000 fowl last week after it was detected on a farm in the province of Pampanga, north of the capital Manila, and spread to five neighboring farms.  Migratory birds or smuggled ducks from China may have brought in the virus, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel PiÃƒÂ±ol has said.  The bird migration season in the Philippines usually starts around September, with the birds returning to their breeding grounds the following March, Mundita Lim, director of the Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB), said in an advisory.  ""The culling, poisoning or chasing of migratory birds is strongly discouraged as they have proven ineffective and counterproductive,"" she added.  Sick or dead wild birds should immediately be reported to the Department of Agriculture to allow checks for the virus, Lim said, urging breeders in areas frequented by migratory birds to guard their flocks against contact with them.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Early tests of the virus in the avian flu outbreak ruled out the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, but Philippine officials have sought further testing by an Australian animal health laboratory that is part of a global network combating the disease.  The Philippines is monitoring the quality and prices of poultry products in its markets, but believes farm authorities have managed to isolate and contain the virus, the presidential palace said in a statement.  Roy Cimatu, the secretary of environment and natural resources, said his department would step up surveillance against efforts to smuggle wild birds by sea and air.

An attack by gunmen on a Turkish restaurant that began late on Sunday left at least 17 people dead and eight wounded in the capital of Burkina Faso, a West African country that has seen a surge in violence by armed groups over the past few years.  The figure was released early on Monday by Burkina Faso's communications minister Remi Dandjinou.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the violence, which continued into early Monday.  Dandjinou told state TV security forces had killed three attackers and that there were still people trapped in the building, according to the Reuters news agency.  Security forces were at the scene with armoured vehicles, as reports of shots fired near an upscale restaurant in Ouagadougou.  Police spokesman Guy Ye told AP that the target of the attack was a Turkish restaurant known as Aziz Istanbul.  Witnesses told AFP news agency that three armed men arrived in a 4x4 at around 9:30 pm (21:00 GMT) and opened fire on customers seated outside the restaurant.  At least one of those killed was a Turkish national, according a paramedic who spoke to the AFP news agency.  OPINION: Reviving Thomas Sankara's spirit  Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation in West Africa, is one of the poorest countries in the world. It shares a northern border with Mali, which has long battled armed groups.  A January 2016 attack at a cafe left 30 people dead.  The three attackers in the 2016 massacre were of foreign origin, according to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which claimed responsibility in the aftermath along with the armed group known as Al Mourabitoun.  But the terror threat in Burkina Faso is increasingly homegrown, experts say.  The northern border region is now the home of a local preacher, Ibrahim Malam Dicko, who radicalised and has claimed recent deadly attacks against troops and civilians. His association, Ansarul Islam, is now considered a ""terrorist group"" by Burkina Faso's government.  Source: News agencies",en,terrorattack,,

597989,bbci,None,Japanese fungus spreading in UK hospitals,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40934190,,15/8/2017 23:15,"Image copyright Getty Images  More than 200 patients in England have been infected or contaminated with a drug-resistant fungus first found in Japan, health officials have confirmed.  Hospitals are on the lookout for further cases and are putting in place measures to help control any further spread of the fungus, Candida auris.  Public Health England says in some cases patients will have no symptoms, but the infection can cause serious bloodstream and wound infections.  So far, no UK patient has died from it.  The first UK case emerged in 2013. Since then, infection rates have been going up - although it remains rare.  Candida auris is proving hard to stop because it has developed some resistance to the drug doctors normally use against it.  As of July, 20 separate NHS trusts and independent hospitals in the UK had detected Candida auris.  More than 35 other hospitals have had patients known to be colonised with Candida auris transferred to them.  Three hospitals have seen large outbreaks that have been difficult to control, despite intensive infection prevention and control measures.  These outbreaks have now been declared over, however, Public Health England says.  Image copyright SPL  Dr Colin Brown, from Public Health England's national infection service, said most of the UK cases had been detected by screening, rather than investigations for patients with symptoms. But 27 patients have developed bloodstream infections.  ""Our enhanced surveillance shows a low risk to patients in healthcare settings. Most cases detected have not shown symptoms or developed an infection as a result of the fungus.  ""NHS hospitals that have experienced outbreaks of Candida auris have not found it to be the cause of death in any patients.""  He said PHE had updated its infection-control guidance for hospitals and nursing homes on managing outbreaks of Candida auris, together with a leaflet for patients who may have the fungal infection.  What is Candida auris?  It belongs to a family of fungi or yeasts that live on the skin and inside the human body.  A more common ""cousin"" in this family is Candida albicans, which causes the yeast infection thrush.  Candida auris was first identified in 2009 in a patient from Japan.  Hospital outbreaks have since been reported in the United States, India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, Oman, South Africa and Spain, as well as the UK.  Is it dangerous?  Some people can carry the infection without having any symptoms or being unwell.  Patients in hospital who catch it may become sick, although infections are still usually minor.  Candida auris can cause more serious bloodstream and wound infections, however.  Nursing staff can take swabs from different parts of a patient's body to check if Candida auris is present.  How is it spread?  That is still being investigated, but experts think it is spread by contact from person to person, on people's hands, clothing or on bits of medical equipment.  Contamination is quick - several hospitals have reported it takes as little as four hours from initial exposure.  What stops it?  Spread can be limited by good hygiene - keeping hands clean by frequent hand washing and using alcohol gel.  If a patient in hospital is found to be infected, their visitors may be asked to wear a gown, plastic aprons and gloves.  Antifungal medicines can treat the infection, despite the strain of Candida auris in the UK having some resistance to some of these drugs.  A biosafety Investigation Unit at Porton Down, the government's military research base, is testing a variety of disinfectants and antiseptics to see if they can kill the infection.",en,diseas,,

Saad al Haj, spokesman for the Osoud al Sharqiya rebel group leader, told Reuters the rebels had shot down the Russian-built MiG using anti-aircraft guns in the eastern countryside of Sweida province.  Haj, whose group is one of two major rebel groups operating in the area, said the pilot was captured and was being interrogated. He could not say if the pilot had been injured.  The eastern countryside of Sweida province borders Jordan in a front where the Syrian army, alongside Iranian-backed militias, had established control last Thursday over checkpoints and border posts.

Syrian officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters could not independently confirm a plane had been downed.  Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels who get support from a command room in Jordan run by Arab and Western backers of the insurgency say fighting continues in the area to try to regain lost ground.  They blamed recent losses on the sudden retreat by a Jordanian-backed tribal militia known as Jaish al Ashair that had patrolled the border area.  This had allowed the army to quickly overrun the border posts and establish a presence in a border strip abandoned in the early years of the conflict.  Last June Osoud al Sharqiya said a military jet had come down about 50 kms east of Damascus in a rebel-held territory near a frontline with army troops. Videos on social media were released of the remains of the pilot and wreckage said to be that of the warplane. REUTERS",en,terrorattack,,

A woman suicide bomber blew herself up and killed 27 others at a market in northeast Nigeria on Tuesday, two local officials said, in an attack bearing the hallmark of Boko Haram fighters.  Two more suicide bombers detonated their devices at the gates to a nearby refugee camp, wounding many people, an emergency services official said.  In all, 83 people were wounded in the three explosions near the city of Maiduguri, epicentre of the long-running conflict between government forces and Boko Haram.  Nigeria's military last year wrested back large swathes of territory from the armed group. But they have struck back with renewed zeal since June, killing at least 143 people before Tuesday's bombings and weakening the army's control.

More than 80 of the nearly 200 schoolgirls who were still missing after a mass Boko Haram abduction in northeast Nigeria in 2014 were freed in Mayin exchage for prisoners.  Its better-known faction, led by Abubakar Shekau, has mainly based itself in the sprawling Sambisa forest, and been characterised by its use of women and children as suicide bombers targeting mosques and markets.  Fiyaso Soyomb, Editor of the International Centre for Investigative Reporting in Nigeria, told Al Jazeera Boko Haram likes to use female suicide bombers because they are harder to detect.  ""Following the trend of attacks, it's clear that there has been an upsurge since the release of [more than 80] girls in exchange for Boko Haram commanders - that's a big factor.""  A rival faction - based in the Lake Chad region, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi and boasting ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) - has in the meantime quietly become a deadly force capable of carrying out highly-organised attacks.  Last month, an oil prospecting team was captured by al-Barnawi's group. At least 37 people, including members of the team, died when rescuers from the military and vigilantes attempted to free them.  The Boko Haram insurgency has killed 20,000 people and forced some 2.7 million to flee their homes in the last eight years.  Source: Al Jazeera and news agencies",en,terrorattack,71,['Nigeria']

The suspects include a married couple who were deported from Hong Kong recently after being caught for allegedly spreading extremist ideology.  ""One of their targets to detonate a bomb at was Istana Negara,"" said West Java police spokesman Yusri Yunus.  The terror plot was uncovered by officers from police counter-terrorism unit Densus 88 when they raided a house in Antapani, a small village in Bandung, at about 6pm local time, he added.  Among the items found in the house were chemicals that the suspects had planned to use in home-made bombs, said Colonel Yusri.  ""They belong to the JAD group, and one of them had learnt (to assemble bombs) from one of Bahrun Naim's blogs,"" he added. ""And police officers in the field were also their targets.""  JAD is short for Jemaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terrorist network which has been behind a series of recent attacks in Indonesia, including a siege on downtown Jakarta in January last year. It also has ties with the Islamic State (IS) terror group. Bahrun Naim is a JAD member said to have joined IS in Syria.  This latest arrest comes as security is being beefed up by the police across Indonesia ahead of its 72nd Independence Day on Thursday.  Indonesian police officers are often the target of attacks by militants who see them as thaghut, or enemies of Islam. On May 23, three policemen were killed in a twin-suicide bombing in Kampung Melayu, East Jakarta. Another officer in Medan was stabbed to death by two assailants on June 25.  The Indonesian National Police have told officers on duty to be alert and to operate in pairs for safety reasons, said spokesman Setyo Wasisto.  This comes after the police had in recent weeks picked up chatter on the Telegram Web messenger about possible terrorists attacks targeted at the police Thursday.  ""We prepare a similar security formation each year, but because of the threats we discovered on social media, we will need to raise our vigilance,"" Inspector-General Setyo told The Straits Times.

Muqtada al-Sadr's trips to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates come as the two nations want to limit Iran's influence in the wider Middle East, especially with Iranian-backed Shiite militias leading the fight against the Islamic State group on Iraqi battlefields.  Meanwhile, the chameleonic cleric hopes to cement his own standing ahead of Iraq's parliamentary elections next year, part of his makeover from a militia warlord whose fighters battled American forces to an Iraqi nationalist who can fill Baghdad's streets with his protesting followers.  How far any possible alliance between al-Sadr and the Gulf Arab countries could go remains to be seen, though photos of the black-turbaned Shiite cleric meeting with Sunni rulers already has stirred speculation in Iran.  ""Why has Muqtada al-Sadr sold himself to the Al Saud?"" the hard-line Iranian newspaper Keyhan bluntly asked after his visit, referring to Saudi Arabia's royal family. The paper also warned that if al-Sadr continued on this path, ""his popularity will fall and he will become an isolated person.""  Such harsh criticism from Iran would have been unthinkable in the years immediately following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.  While Sunni Muslims represent the world's principal branch of Islam, Shiites are the majority in Iraq. Neighboring Iran has had a government overseen by Shiite clerics since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated government massacred Shiites after the 1991 Gulf War and continued imprisoning, torturing and executing others up to his overthrow.  Al-Sadr, the son of a prominent Shiite cleric assassinated in a 1999 attack believed to be organized by Saddam, quickly organized Shiite dispossessed under Saddam against the American occupation.  ""The little serpent has left and the great serpent has come,"" al-Sadr told CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" program in 2003.  Saddam loyalists and Shiite extremists alike would soon fight an insurgency against the American forces. Al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia fought American forces throughout much of 2004 in Baghdad and other cities.  Al-Sadr's forces are believed to have later taken part in the sectarian killings between Shiites and Sunnis that plagued Iraq for several years after the bombing of one of the holiest sites in Shiite Islam. Al-Sadr left for Qom, a holy Shiite city in Iran, for religious studies around the time that his forces accepted a cease-fire in the 2008 battle of Basra, in southern Iraq.  Since that time much has changed.  Al-Sadr's followers have taken part in Iraqi military offensives against the Islamic State group in Tikrit and other cities. He has organized rallies against government corruption, including breaching the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, the highly secure area housing government offices and many foreign embassies.  On July 30, al-Sadr traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the next in line to the throne. The state-run Saudi Press Agency published a photograph of King Salman's son smiling next to the cleric, only saying the two ""reviewed the Saudi-Iraqi relations and a number of issues of mutual interest.""  In the UAE, al-Sadr met on Sunday with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan, Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, and other officials.  ""Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,"" Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement carried on the state-run WAM news agency.  Anwar Gargash, the Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs, tweeted after the meeting that it was part of an effort to ""build bridges"" between the Gulf Arab nations and Iraq.  ""Our ambition is to see a prosperous, stable Arab Iraq,"" Gargash wrote. ""The challenge is great and the prize is bigger.""  Using ""Arab"" to describe Iraq is no accident for the UAE, which opposed the 2003 American invasion. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia want to limit Shiite-ruled Iran's power in Iraq.  ""There are serious questions about how to help encourage Iraqi stability and minimize Iranian influence in the country,"" said Lori Plotkin Boghardt, a former U.S. intelligence official who now is a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""Building ties with someone like al-Sadr is part of the Saudis' and Emiratis' answer to this.""  One of the biggest question marks ahead for Iraq is what happens after the war against the Islamic State group.  Shiite militias advised by members of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard have proved to be among the most effective ground forces in the fight against IS. Disarming or incorporating the groups into existing security forces likely would be a major challenge for the national government.  Al-Sadr, already a respected Shiite cleric with a massive base of followers, demanded in March that Shiite militias disband, saying only Iraqi national forces should hold territory in the country. Though many among the militias disagree, saying they have proven their credentials in battle against IS, al-Sadr's stand could provide Baghdad with the cover it needs to do so.  ""This would be, of course, music to the Gulf countries' ears,"" said Fanar Haddad, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore.  For al-Sadr, whose loyalists represent one of the biggest blocs in Iraq's parliament, his foreign trips burnish his credentials as an Iraqi leader. However, it remains unclear what he wants Ã¢â‚¬â€ and whether any tilt toward the Sunni Gulf countries truly would represent a total break with Iran for the Iraqi nationalist.  ""It shows he has options,"" Haddad said.  ___  Associated Press writers Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

The men, wearing explosive belts, were linked to the first attack, police say.  Thirteen people died and dozens were hurt when a van hit crowds in the Las Ramblas area of Barcelona on Thursday. The driver fled and is still at large.  Spain's PM Mariano Rajoy described it a ""jihadist attack"", which so-called Islamic State said it had carried out.  Mr Rajoy has announced three days of national mourning and a minute's silence will be held later on Friday.  The authorities are now also linking the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils with an explosion at a house on Wednesday evening in the town of Alcanar that left one person dead.  Police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said it appeared the residents at the Alcanar house had been ""preparing an explosive device"".  In Cambrils, seven people, including a police officer, were wounded when a car was driven into them early on Friday, Catalan emergency services said. One person is in a critical condition.  Spanish media reported that the attackers' vehicle overturned and when the men got out they were quickly fired upon by police.  A series of controlled explosions was then carried out.  Police say the situation in Cambrils - a popular seaside resort to the south-west of Barcelona - is now under control.  Meanwhile police are continuing to search for the driver of the van used in the Barcelona attack, who fled on foot. He is believed to be the sole attacker there.  Tourists and locals fled when the rented vehicle sped down Las Ramblas in the centre of the city, mowing down people.  Witnesses said the van deliberately targeted people, weaving from side to side as it drove down the boulevard.  Two people have been arrested, but police say neither was the driver.  Police have released a photo of a man named as Driss Oubakir, whose documents were used to rent the van involved in the attack.  Local media say he is in his 20s, and was born in Morocco. However, latest reports suggest he has told police he was not involved, and that his documents were stolen.  So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the Las Ramblas attack, saying in a brief statement carried by its Amaq news agency that it was carried out by ""Islamic State soldiers"". The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim.  Vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of attacks across Europe since July last year.  In another incident, police shot dead a man who drove into officers at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Barcelona, but the authorities said there was no evidence that he was connected to the attack in Las Ramblas.  Analysis: A worrying trend  Gordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent  Barcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or ""soft"" target.  In Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons.  In the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way.  The weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services.  Although so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its ""soldiers"" had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter.  Either way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature.  What did people see in Barcelona?  A businessman from New Orleans, who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said: ""I heard a crowd screaming. It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star.  ""I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground.""  Aamer Anwar said he was walking down Las Ramblas, which was ""jam-packed"" with tourists.  ""All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids,"" he told Sky News.  ""Police were very, very quickly there, police officers with guns, batons, everywhere. Then the whole street started getting pushed back.  ""Police officers who got there just started screaming at people to move back, move back.""  Kevin Kwast, who is on holiday in Barcelona with his family, said: ""I was eating with my family in La Boqueria market very near where the crash occurred.  ""Hundreds of people started stampeding through the market... we started running with them going outside right into where casualties were already on the ground.

Police are treating the Barcelona incident as a ""terrorist attack"" but have not commented officially on the Cambrils rampage.  One of the suspects arrested over the Barcelona attack is a man born in the Spanish territory of Melilla in northern Morocco.  The other who has been named, Driss Oukabir, is Moroccan.

Separately, police said they suspected a house explosion late Wednesday, August 16, at a house in Alcanar some 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Barcelona was linked to the van attack. At least one person died in the house where police suspect they were ""preparing an explosive device"".  How did authorities respond?  Emergency services quickly arrived on the scene and cordoned off the area, with several ambulances and police vehicles responding.  The city also closed down metro stations in the area, with authorities telling people to stay away from the area.

The five men attempted to drive into tourists on the Cambrils seafront, police said. Their car overturned and some of them began stabbing people. Four were shot dead at the scene and the fifth was killed a few hundred meters away, police said.  Police said they had arrested a Moroccan and a man from Spain's north African enclave of Melilla, though neither was the driver of the van. He was seen escaping on foot and was still at large. A third man was arrested in the town of Ripoll on Friday.  Police said later they had made a fourth arrest in connection with the attacks but gave no details.  A Spanish woman was killed in the Cambrils incident while several other civilians and a police officer were injured. Police destroyed explosive belts the men had been wearing, though they turned out to be fake.  Of the 130 people injured in both attacks, 17 were in a critical condition and 30 were serious, an emergency services spokesman said.  Shortly before midnight on Wednesday, the day before the van plowed into the tree-lined walkway of Barcelona's Las Ramblas avenue, one person was killed in an explosion in a house in a separate town southwest of Barcelona, police said.  A judicial source said investigators believed a cell of at least eight people, possibly 12, may have been involved in the Barcelona and Cambrils operations and that it had been planning to use gas canisters.  Later on Friday, residents and tourists returned to Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas promenade where hours earlier a white van had zigzagged at high speed through pedestrians and cyclists, leaving bodies and injured writhing in pain in its wake.  The injured and dead came from 34 countries, ranging from France and Germany to Pakistan and the Philippines, Catalan emergency services said. Spanish media said several children were killed.  As Spain began three days of mourning, people laid flowers and lit candles in memory of the victims along the promenade. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Spain's King Felipe visited Barcelona's main square nearby to observe a minute's silence.  Defiant crowds later chanted ""I am not afraid"" in Catalan.  Islamic State Claim  Islamic State's Amaq news agency said the attackers had carried out the operation ""in response to calls for targeting coalition states"" - a reference to a US-led coalition against the Sunni militant group. Spain has several hundred soldiers in Iraq training local forces in the fight against Islamic State.  There was no immediate indication though that Islamic State had directed or organised the attack, although some of those responsible for similar attacks in Europe have been inspired by the jihadist group.  Islamist militants have staged several attacks across Europe in the past 13 months, killing over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm.  In March 2004, Islamist militants placed bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people.  Reuters",en,terrorattack,75,['Barcelona']
624488,cnn,Ben Westcott Laura Smith-spark Eliza Mackintosh,"Barcelona and Cambrils attacks could have been bigger, police say",http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/18/asia/barcelona-cambrils-terror-attacks/index.html,18/8/2017 0:00,19/8/2017 21:10,"Barcelona (CNN) The perpetrators of the terror attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils originally planned to use explosive devices to wreak greater devastation but were apparently thwarted because their materials detonated prematurely, police said Friday.  A house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, was destroyed in a blast Wednesday night -- hours before one attacker mowed down dozens of people in the heart of Barcelona , killing 13. A group of five attackers then drove into pedestrians in the town of Cambrils, killing one, in the early hours of Friday.  Catalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero told reporters that explosives were found in the Alcanar property and that police ""are working on the hypothesis that these attacks were being prepared in that house.""  A source briefed on the investigation said a preliminary assessment of the Alcanar property indicated there were traces of the powerful explosive TATP in the rubble.  TATP has been used in numerous Islamist terrorist attacks carried out in Europe, including the November 2015 Paris attacks, the March 2016 Brussels bombings, the May Manchester bombing and a failed bomb attempt by an Islamist extremist at the Gare Centrale in Brussels in June.  The explosion meant the attackers were unable to use material they were planning to deploy in attacks in Barcelona, Cambrils and perhaps elsewhere, he said. The attack in Barcelona, capital of the Spanish region of Catalonia, was therefore ""more rudimentary than they originally planned,"" Trapero said.  The revelations pointed to the alarming possibility that authorities knew nothing of an advanced plot to mount a spectacular terror attack until an accidental explosion at the perpetrators' base -- and despite this eye-catching setback the terror cell managed to carry out two further improvised attacks without impediment.  Key developments  -- Four people have been arrested: one of them in Alcanar and three in Ripoll. Three were Moroccan citizens and another was Spanish; they ranged in age from 21 to 34. None of them had been on authorities' radar for terrorism. Police said Friday they have identified three of the suspects, but didn't name them publicly.  -- People from at least 34 countries were among the injured in the attacks, Catalan authorities said. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said an American citizen was among the dead. Two Italians were the first of the deceased victims to be named. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said one of the dead was Canadian. Spain's Department of Interior said four Spaniards and one Portuguese national were killed.  -- Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy labeled the Barcelona attack ""jihadi terrorism."" Rajoy's government has declared three days of mourning across Spain.  -- The ISIS media wing, Amaq, has said the Barcelona attackers were ""soldiers of the Islamic State,"" but stopped short of explicitly claiming responsibility for the attacks or providing evidence for their claims.  -- King Felipe, the Spanish head of state, led a moment's silence at Barcelona's PlaÃƒÂ§a de Catalunya -- near where the attack began. Crowds later joined in lengthy applause. ""We are not afraid, we won't forget,"" they chanted.  King Felipe VI of Spain leads a moment of silence in PlaÃƒÂ§a de Catalunya on Friday.  An attack gone wrong  The first sign of the terror cell's activities -- although its significance was not immediately understood -- came Wednesday evening when the house in Alcanar was almost completely destroyed by an unexpected explosion.  One person, a Spanish national, died the in the blast, and another was seriously injured. Both were found inside the house. The injured man is one of the four suspects arrested. He was moved to a police station in Tortosa on Friday, Catalan police said.  Six other people were also injured in the explosion, according to a Catalan fire department report, no information was provided as to the identity of the six.  Police said Friday there were other ""biological remains"" found at the site, but it is unclear whether they belong to a different person.  The debris of a house in the village of Alcanar, Catalonia, is seen Thursday after it collapsed due to an explosion.  ""They were trying to make explosives out of butane gas among other things,"" Trapero said. He speculated that ""some sort of accident"" caused the explosion, therefore avoiding greater catastrophe later.  Thwarted by the accidental explosion, and possibly alarmed at the attention it had drawn, it appears that the surviving members of the cell scrambled to mount an alternative plan. The next day at about 5 p.m., a rental van was driven at high speed from Barcelona's PlaÃƒÂ§a de Catalunya deep into the teeming crowds on the city's most famous thoroughfare, Las Ramblas.  ""I saw people flying into the air and everyone was running into the shops on either side,"" witness Ali Shirazinia told CNN.  At least 13 people were killed and 120 injured. The driver of the van fled on foot. The Interior Ministry said Friday that 15 of the 59 people still hospitalized remain in critical condition.  The van used in the Barcelona attack was abandoned at the scene, August 18, 2017.  Hours later, as details of the atrocity in Barcelona were still emerging, five attackers drove an Audi A3 into several pedestrians in Cambrils, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Barcelona, early on Friday morning. Police engaged in a shootout with the attackers, and all five were shot dead, four of them by one officer.  A woman subsequently died from her injuries, Catalan emergency services said, taking the number of dead in both attacks to 14. Six others were injured, three seriously.  Photographs showed the black Audi, flipped upside down with its windows smashed out, being removed from the scene.  Catalan police later said they found an ax and knives in the car, and the attackers had fake explosive belts attached to them. Before being shot they had wounded one person in the face with a knife. Police were investigating whether one of the attackers was the driver of the van used in the Barcelona attack.  Police officers stand near an overturned car onto a platform at the spot where terrorists were intercepted by police in Cambrils, Friday, Aug. 18.  Alex Folch, 28, told CNN he saw the immediate aftermath of the shootout from his holiday apartment on the fifth floor of the Club Nautic Cambrils, on the Consulat de Mar.  He said he saw three people lying on the ground surrounded by police, one with what appeared to be ""a metallic kind of belt"" around the waist.  Folch said he could see snipers on the roof beside him and later heard controlled explosions conducted by police.  Police said later they have identified each attacker but they didn't release their names publicly.  The house in Alcanar appears crucial to the investigation. Trapero said several of its residents had hired some of the vehicles used in the Barcelona and Cambrils attacks. He added that ""the investigation is centered on identifying those persons who were in that house.""  A car that ran over police officers at a checkpoint in Barcelona later on Thursday was unconnected with the attacks, Trapero said. One of the occupants of the car was found to have been stabbed.  Shock and fear in Barcelona  The Catalan government said the Barcelona victims came from 34 countries.  The first to be identified was an Italian, Bruno Gulotta, who worked for Tom's Hardware Italia. He was a much-loved colleague with a partner and two young children, the company said. He had been on holiday in Barcelona with his family. The second victim named was another Italian, Luca Rosso.  Belgium's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jose de Pierpont said one Belgian was among those killed in the attack.  A 74-year-old Portuguese woman has also been identified by the Portuguese government as one of the victims in Barcelona.  Las Ramblas reopened Friday morning but reminders of the previous day's horror were all around.  In some outdoor cafÃƒÂ©s, full glasses of beer and sangria sat out on tables, left behind after people scattered. Overturned chairs and napkins were strewn on the street. Waiters were beginning to pick up the pieces as restaurants opened.  Flowers, candles and messages of solidarity piled up through the day at makeshift shrines along the street.  Some shocked residents and tourists had come to the normally bustling avenue to pay their respects to the attack victims. Others gathered for a march intended to show unity in the face of fear.  ""It was an attack against humanity,"" Sandra Gregorio said after laying flowers at one of the many memorials that has sprung up. ""Look at this street, Barcelonians are not afraid,"" her boyfriend Marc GuzmÃƒÂ¡n added. ""We have to be united, now more than ever.""  Hajar Menssouri, a 24-year-old laboratory technician and student, told CNN: ""I joined the march to show that fear would not divide us.""  Earlier, resident Federico Colmenarejo, 32, walked along Las Ramblas in a daze. His apartment overlooks the street -- and he said a phone call from his grandmother at the time of the attack had saved his life because it had stopped him going out.  ""Just to think how is it possible that I cross this street every day on my way to work. I can't believe it. In Barcelona this never happens,"" he told CNN.",en,terrorattack,75,['Barcelona']

They are treating the attack as a terrorist incident.  The suspect, arrested after being shot by police, is an 18-year-old Moroccan. Four other Moroccans have been held.  The two women stabbed to death were both Finnish. Eight people were also injured, among them a Briton, a Swede and an Italian.  The ages of the casualties ranged from 15 to 67, police said, but gave no more details.  PM Juha Sipila told a press conference that Finland had experienced a terror attack for the first time.  'Asylum process'  Police said in a statement: ""The act had been investigated as murder, but during the night we received additional information which indicates that the criminal offences are now terrorist killings.""  They said the identity of the 18-year-old Moroccan was known, but they have not released it.  At a later press briefing, they said the suspect had arrived in Finland in 2016 and had ""been part of the asylum process"".  Crista Granroth, from the National Bureau of Investigation, said: ""It seems that the suspect chose women as his targets, because the men who were wounded were injured when they tried to help, or prevent the attacks.""  She said six of the eight wounded people were women.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Candles were lit at the scene of the stabbings in Turku  In addition to the four other arrests, an international search warrant has been issued for a sixth suspect.  The 18-year-old Moroccan is still being treated in hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg. Two other people are also still in hospital.  The UK embassy in Finland said it had ""been in touch with the British national and offered consular support"".  The attack happened in the Puutori/Market Square area of Turku.  Police said the alarm was raised at 16:02 local time (13:02 GMT) on Friday, when a man was reported to have attacked passers-by with a knife.  Witnesses said he then ran to a nearby square and stabbed more people before he was shot in the thigh. Police said he was arrested at 16:05.  One eyewitness, Laura Laine, told Reuters: ""First thing we heard was a young woman, screaming like crazy. I thought it's just kids having fun... but then people started to move around and I saw a man with a knife in his hand, stabbing a woman.  ""Then a person ran towards us shouting 'he has a knife' and everybody from the terrace ran inside. Next, a woman came into the cafe. She was crying hysterically, down on her knees, saying someone's neck has been slashed open.""  Flags are being flown at half-mast in Finland.  Interior Minister Paula Risikko said on Twitter: ""Terrorists want to pit people against each other. We will not let this happen. Finnish society will not be defeated by fear or hatred.""  The ministry said security was being stepped up across the country.",en,terrorattack,76,['Finland']

But the regional Catalan government said there could be further arrests.  A key suspect linked to the Barcelona attack and a later one is still sought.  Thursday's attack in the Catalan capital saw a van driven at high speed along Las Ramblas - the pedestrianised avenue popular with tourists and residents alike.  Spanish police are searching for Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who they suspect may be the driver who escaped the scene on foot.

A woman was killed and police shot dead five suspected attackers, including Moussa Oukabir, 17, originally reported as the key suspect in the Barcelona attack.  Oukabir is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van used in Barcelona and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle.  The terror cell is reported to comprise 12 men. The Catalan Interior Minster, Joaquim Forn, stressed that the police operation could not be considered over until all those suspected of being part of the cell were in custody.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption CCTV footage shows the van speeding down Las Ramblas  Police say the suspects had been planning more sophisticated attacks, but an explosion on Wednesday at a house in the town of Alcanar deprived them of bomb material, so they carried out simpler attacks using vehicles.  Abouyaaqoub lived in the town of Ripoll to the north of Barcelona. Three people have been arrested in Ripoll, and one in Alcanar.  In Ripoll the apartment of an imam was raided on Saturday.  Another van, a Renault Kangoo, is also being sought, amid reports it may have been driven across the border into France.  Security is being stepped up, though the security alert level is staying unchanged as there is no information suggesting an imminent attack.

BARCELONA: Grief-stricken Barcelona paid homage Sunday to victims of two terror assaults at a mass in the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sagrada Familia church, as investigators turned their focus to a missing Moroccan imam believed to have radicalised the young attackers.  King Felipe, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and CataloniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s president Carles Puigdemont led the ceremony mourning the 14 people killed by jihadists who used vehicles to mow down pedestrians in BarcelonaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday and in the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils early Friday.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“These have been days of tears, many tears,Ã¢â‚¬Â said auxiliary bishop Sebastia Taltavull.  Outside the church, snipers were posted on rooftops surrounding the landmark building by Gaudi, while heavily armed police stood guard as hundreds of people gathered under grey skies.  Catalonia resident Teresa Rodriguez said she had turned up to pray for the victims.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“What happened in Las Ramblas is really hard for us, we go for walks there often, it could have happened to me, my children or anyone. And here we are. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s huge, huge,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said as she fought back tears.  Later Sunday, nearly 100,000 people were expected at BarcelonaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Camp Nou stadium for their teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first game of the season, to be marked by a minute of silence for the victims.  Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said Saturday the cell behind the carnage that also injured 120 had been Ã¢â‚¬Å“dismantled,Ã¢â‚¬Â although local authorities took a more cautious tone.  Police were still hunting 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who media reports say was the driver of a van that smashed into crowds on the popular Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday, killing 13 people.  Hours later, there was a similar assault in the seaside town of Cambrils that left one woman dead. Police shot and killed the five attackers, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts.  An extensive security operation including roadblocks was mounted overnight across Catalonia.  ImamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role ?  The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attacks, believed to be its first in Spain.  The terror cell in Spain reportedly comprised at least 12 young men, some of them teenagers.  Investigators are seeking to unravel the role of an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, who is believed to have radicalised many of the youths from a small town called Ripoll, at the foot of the Pyrenees.  Several of the suspects Ã¢â‚¬â€ including Abouyaaqoub Ã¢â‚¬â€ grew up or lived in the town of about 10,000 inhabitants.  On Saturday, police raided the imamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment in Ripoll, his flatmate, who would only identify himself as Nourddem, told AFP.  Spanish media quoting police sources, said the officers were looking for DNA traces in the apartment to compare with body parts found in an explosion in a home in Alcanar, about 200 kilometres (120 miles) south of Barcelona, where the alleged jihadists were believed to have been building bombs.  Police said they believed the suspects were planning a much larger attack.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They were preparing one or several attacks in Barcelona, and an explosion in Alcanar stopped this as they no longer had the material they needed to commit attacks of an even bigger scope,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Josep Lluis Trapero of CataloniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s police.  Security forces were seen removing dozens of gas canisters from the house in Alcanar on Friday.  The imam was also known to police, according to Spanish media, which reported that he had spent time in prison.  El Pais and El Mundo quoting anti-terrorist forces said the imam had met prisoners linked to the March 2004 Al-Qaeda-inspired bombing attack on commuter trains in Madrid that killed 191 people, the worst terror attack in Europe.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrainwashedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  A clearer picture is emerging of the suspected perpetrators.  Most of them are children of Moroccan immigrants, including Ripoll-born Moussa Oukabir, 17, one of five suspects shot dead in Cambrils. His older brother Driss is among the four arrested.  In Morocco, Moussa and DrissÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father Said broke down, surrounded by relatives.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I hope they will say heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innocentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to lose my two sons,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told AFP.  A cousin said Moussa Ã¢â‚¬Å“loved playing football, having a good time, chatting up girlsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  He travelled to Morocco almost every year for the summer holidays and was expected back last Tuesday.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The last few months, he started to become interested in religion. He used to go to a mosque in Ripoll. Maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where he was brainwashed,Ã¢â‚¬Â the cousin said.  Security ramped up  Victims of the attack came from three dozen countries including Algeria, Australia, China, France, Ireland, Peru and Venezuela, reflecting BarcelonaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status as SpainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular tourist destination.  Fifty-four people are still in hospital, including 12 in critical condition, Catalan emergency services said.  With the peak summer tourism season still in full swing, the Spanish government ordered security ramped up in crowded places, although it kept the terror threat level at four out of a maximum five.  Tourism has been vital to SpainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic recovery, and because it has until now been spared the wave of extremist attacks that hit Europe, it has recorded a surge as visitors shunned more restive destinations such as Tunisia and Egypt.",en,terrorattack,75,['Spain']

The area where the soldiers were killed was near a border stronghold close to the mountains of Arsal, where Shi'ite Hezbollah militia recently forced Sunni Syrian militants to leave in a joint cross-border operation with the Syrian army, the source added.  The Lebanese army had launched an offensive on Saturday against an Islamic State enclave on the northeastern border with Syria.  The Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah also announced an assault on the militants from the Syrian side of the frontier.  An army spokesman said on Saturday that a third of the area in the hands of the militants had been recaptured since the offensive began, with 20 militants killed in direct combat, shelling or aerial strikes, while 10 soldiers had been injured.  Many rebels, alongside thousands of Sunni refugees who fled after the Syrian army and Hezbollah regained control of towns and villages they had once overran in the early years of the conflict, took shelter on the Lebanese side of the border strip.  Northeastern Lebanon was the scene of one of the worst spillovers of Syria's war into Lebanon in 2014, when Islamic State and Nusra Front militants attacked the town of Arsal.

ERBIL: As Iraqi forces pressed their offensive to retake Tal Afar on Monday, a Yazidi politician urged them to quickly rescue the many Yazidi men, women and children still believed to be held captive in the city by Islamic State militants.  Vian Dakhil, a member of the Iraqi parliament, said the fate of children who had been kidnapped, sold or had their identities changed was of particular concern.  Dakhil won international prominence in 2014, when she stood up in parliament and begged for help for the religious minority that had come under militant attack in Sinjar.  The Yazidi area in northern Iraq had previously been home to about 400,000. In a matter of days, more than 3,000 Yazidis were killed and about 6,800 kidnapped, either sold into slavery or conscripted to fight for Islamic State.  More than 3,000 women and children are still believed to be held captive by Islamic State, according to community leaders.  ""We ask the leaders of the military and security forces to take precautions regarding the large number of kidnapped Yazidis still present in Tal Afar and its surrounding villages,"" Dakhil said in a statement.  Advertisement  Advertisement  She urged the advancing Iraqi force to rescue the enslaved Yazidis ""as soon as possible"".  Dakhil asked for rescued Yazidis to be separated from other fleeing civilians and not be sent to refugee camps.  Tal Afar is one of the few remaining Islamic State strongholds in northern Iraq.  Between 10,000 and 40,000 people are thought to remain in Tal Afar and its surrounding villages, with more than 30,000 having fled since April, according to U.N. estimates.  Important for its position along the supply route between Mosul and Syria, it has produced some of Islamic State's most senior commanders and was cut off from the rest of IS-held territory in June.  About 2,000 battle-hardened militants remain in Tal Afar, according to U.S. and Iraqi military commanders.  Iraqi security forces launched their offensive to retake Tal Afar on Sunday. Announcing the start of the operation, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told jihadists to ""surrender or die"".  Several surrounding villages and roads had already been retaken by the second day of the offensive, with a view to trapping the remaining militants in the city itself. A Federal Police spokesman said a network of tunnels had also been seized.  ""We are cutting off the arms of the octopus to make it weaker and vulnerable,"" Colonel Kareem al-Lami of the Iraqi army's 9th Division, said.  (Reporting by Raya Jalabi.

Australian police this month charged Khaled Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat on two counts of planning a terrorist attack after conducting raids to disrupt what authorities described as an Islamic State-inspired plot to bomb an Etihad Airways flight.  Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk said in a news conference that one of the men's brothers, Tareq Khayat, had moved to the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and become a commander in the jihadist group more than a year ago.  Lebanon's Internal Security Force (ISF) then placed Tareq, Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat, and a fourth brother Amer Khayat, under surveillance.

Machnouk said that Amer Khayat had arrived in Lebanon on July 15, the day Australian police have said the plotters tried to smuggle a bomb onto a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi.  Australian police had earlier said that a man had tried to check in luggage without knowing that it contained a bomb, hidden in a meat grinder, that his brother had given him.

""There are no terrorist hideouts in Pakistan. We have operated against all terrorists, including (the) Haqqani network,"" spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor told a media briefing in Islamabad.  He said evidence to that effect was shared with General Joseph Votel, chief of the U.S. Central Command, who visited Pakistan over the weekend.  U.S. officials say Afghan's Islamist Taliban insurgents and the allied Haqqani network, deemed the most lethal Afghan militant group, are supported by elements of Pakistan's military and top intelligence agency, a charge Islamabad denies.  U.S. President Donald Trump was expected in an address to the nation due at 0100 GMT to address the future of relations with Islamabad, part of a review of policy on the protracted war in neighboring Afghanistan.  With Taliban insurgent forces no nearer to defeat after more than 15 years of conflict, Trump was likely to announce a modest increase in U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan, a senior administration official said.  ""As regard to U.S. policy, and even if it comes with certain  coercive, you know, announcements, Pakistan shall do whatever is best in the national interest,"" Ghafoor said.  Votel met Pakistan's army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and on Saturday toured the Waziristan area that was long the base of local and foreign militants along the Afghan border, where Pakistan's military waged a campaign to drive them out.  Washington and Islamabad have at times had a rocky relationship, including over the secret U.S. raid inside Pakistan in 2011 that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  Relations have been under scrutiny in Trump's lengthy review of a new strategy and troop levels in the fight against the Taliban and other Islamist militants in Afghanistan.

Mohamed Houli Chemlal, 21, was the first of four surviving suspects to be questioned in Madrid's National Court, which deals with terror-related cases, over the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort that claimed 15 lives and wounded more than 100 people.  The Spaniard was injured in an accidental explosion at a makeshift bomb factory on Wednesday evening that killed an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, thought to have radicalised him and other young suspects.  Police had previously revealed that the suspected militants had been preparing bombs for ""one or more attacks in Barcelona"".  Josep Lluis Trapero, head of police in Catalonia, said 120 gas canisters and traces of TATP components - a homemade explosive that is a hallmark of the Islamic State group that claimed the attacks - had been found at their bomb factory.  The accidental explosion in the house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, may have forced the suspects to modify their plans.  Advertisement  Advertisement  LOGISTICAL SUPPORT?    The questioning of the four suspects caps five days of angst following the vehicle ramming attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils.  Spanish police shot dead Younes Abouyaaqoub, the suspected Barcelona van driver, on Monday in a dramatic end to the manhunt for the Moroccan national.  He was the last fugitive member of a 12-man cell suspected of plotting the attacks.  Besides the four men detained, the rest were killed, either by police or in the explosion in Alcanar.  While Catalan police say the cell has been dismantled, investigators are trying to determine if it had logistical or other forms of support from other individuals.  Questions are also arising about the group's possible international connections.  AUDI IN PARIS, IMAM IN BELGIUM    In Belgium, the mayor of the Vilvorde region told AFP that Satty spent time in the Brussels suburb of Machelen - next to the city's airport - between January and March 2016.  On the other side of Brussels, the Molenbeek suburb has gained notoriety as a hotbed of international militants after the Brussels bombings in March 2016 and the Paris attacks in November 2015.  And in France, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told BFMTV that the Audi used to mow down people in Cambrils had been detected by speed cameras in the Paris region while making ""a very rapid return trip"" days before the Spanish attacks.  Collomb is due to host Spanish counterpart Juan Ignacio Zoido on Wednesday for talks due to include anti-terrorism cooperation.  At least one of the suspects also spent a night in Zurich in December, according to Swiss police, which said it was too early to speculate about any connections with Switzerland.  IN BANDAGES BUT FIT    The four suspects in court included Driss Oukabir, the older brother of Moussa who was killed by police in Cambrils on Friday along with four other suspects.  The others were Mohamed Aallaa, one of three brothers allegedly involved, and Salh El Karib, who manages a store that allows people to make calls abroad.  Salah El Karib, suspected of involvement in the terror cell that carried out twin attacks in Spain, is escorted by Spanish Civil Guards from a detention centre in Tres Cantos, near Madrid, on Aug 22, 2017. (Photo: AFP/Stringer)  Chemlal, dressed in hospital patient clothing and with his right hand bandaged, was brought in after a doctor determined that he was fit for interrogation, a court spokesman told AFP.  Veteran magistrate Fernando Andreu is due to determine which charges to file against the four men and what role they may have played in the terror plot.    'ONE OR MORE' ATTACKS    Five days on, a clearer picture is emerging of the events that unfolded last week.  Abouyaaqoub used a vehicle to smash into crowds on Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100.  While on the run, the 22-year-old stabbed to death the driver of a car he hijacked to get away.  Several hours later, a similar vehicle attack in Cambrils saw a car run into pedestrians, with one occupant jumping out and stabbing a woman, who later died.  Police shot dead the five attackers there, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts.  Abouyaaqoub was gunned down on Monday in a village about 60 kilometres (40 miles) west of Barcelona, after receiving multiple tip-offs.  Police opened fire as he appeared to be wearing an explosive belt, which turned out to be fake.  The victims of the attacks were from three dozen countries including those as far afield as Australia, China and the United States.",en,terrorattack,75,['Spain']
645100,todayonline,None,Spain attacks turn spotlight on Moroccan militants,http://www.todayonline.com/world/europe/spain-attacks-turn-spotlight-moroccan-militants,,23/8/2017 7:42,"MADRID Ã¢â‚¬â€ As the Spanish authorities piece together details of the cell behind the terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, their probe has centred on a dozen men of Moroccan origin.  Some of the suspects, including Younes Abouyaaqoub Ã¢â‚¬â€ believed to be the driver of the van that ploughed into people on BarcelonaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Las Ramblas boulevard, were born in Morocco and moved to Spain.  At least one of the others was born in Spain. It would not be the first time radicalised Moroccan youths living in Europe have been at the centre of terror attacks on the continent Ã¢â‚¬â€ Moroccans were involved in the Paris attacks in November 2015 and the Brussels airport bombings four months later.  Yet in Morocco there have been no significant attacks since the bombing of a tourist restaurant in Marrakesh in 2011 killed 17 people.  Moroccan security services have dismantled dozens of cells recruiting fighters for the Islamic State in Syria.  But analysts say jihadi groups have found it increasingly difficult to operate in the country since the authorities started beefing up and professionalising their security. This began after 12 suicide bombers blew themselves up during one night in 2003 at multiple locations in Casablanca, the kingdomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic hub, killing 33 people.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morocco has been very successful at driving deep underground any major Al Qaeda or IS group,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mr Issandr Amrani, north Africa director at the International Crisis Group.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been a single successful attack since the formation of the IS (in 2014). Moroccan jihadis have largely gone to fight abroad, rather than stay at home because the security lockdown is too pervasive.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Between 2011 and 2013, the authorities turned a blind eye to Moroccan jihadis joining militants fighting in SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s civil war, Mr Amrani and others say. As uprisings swept across the Arab world and pro-democracy protests erupted in Morocco, Rabat allowed would-be foreign fighters to travel unhindered rather than risk them exploiting uncertainty at home.  From 2012, about 1,600 Moroccans are thought to have travelled to Syria, according to the Moroccan authorities. The Crisis Group says an estimated 2,000 Moroccan dual nationals left EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immigrant communities to join the Syrian conflict after it erupted in 2011. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The attitude (in Morocco) was good riddance, let them direct their energies elsewhere,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mr Amrani.  That began to change after the rise of the IS in 2014 as concerns grew at the prospect of militants returning from SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battlefields and launching jihadist campaigns in Morocco.  Security was tightened at borders and anti-terrorism laws were strengthened to impose heavy jail terms and fines on anyone who travelled to join militant groups abroad.  Mr Amrani says that despite the involvement of Moroccan jihadis in terrorism operations in Europe and the large number of Moroccans who became foreign fighters in Syria, there has been no evidence so far that the attacks in Europe were plotted by groups in Morocco.  Mr Abdelhak Khiame, head of MoroccoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations, the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s counter-terrorism agency, told the BBC last year that the radicalisation of Moroccan youths in Europe was Ã¢â‚¬Å“due to factors in the countries where they liveÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes, these people have Moroccan roots but they were born, grew and acquired values from Western countries,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even their education in Islam was not carried out by those who (teach religion) in Morocco.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The kingdom, which lies across the narrow Strait of Gibraltar from Spain, is credited for its security co-operation with European governments. Mr Khiame has been quoted as saying that information provided by Morocco has helped foil attacks in Europe.  Ms Carola Garcia-Calvo, senior analyst on international terrorism in SpainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Real Instituto Elcano, a think-tank, said that the level of security co-operation between Rabat and Madrid was Ã¢â‚¬Å“very, very, highÃ¢â‚¬Â. She said the two countries had worked together to dismantle IS recruitment networks that often straddled borders.  She pointed out that in some cases these networks included people in Morocco as well as members in Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in north Africa inside the kingdomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s borders. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some 178 people have been arrested in Spain since 2013 for links with jihadi cells and networks,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Around 40 per cent of those people are Moroccan nationals and 40 per cent are Spanish.Ã¢â‚¬Â FINANCIAL TIMES",en,terrorattack,75,['Spain']

Mattis flew in for the one-day visit after stopping in Iraq to review progress in the campaign against the Islamic State group, urging coalition partners to prevent other political issues from disrupting the growing momentum against the militants.  In Ankara, he held talks with Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli and was later to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Turkey, an important NATO ally of the United States and part of the coalition fighting the IS militants, is incensed that Washington has been arming the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in the assault on the militants' stronghold of Raqa, in northern Syria.  Turkey regards the YPG as the Syrian affiliate of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), but Washington has been impressed with its ability to combat IS on the ground.  In May, the Pentagon said it had begun transferring small arms and vehicles to the YPG to support its role as a leading player in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-Syrian Arab alliance fighting IS.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The weapons include AK-47s and small-calibre machine guns.  'WHATEVER THE PRICE'    Erdogan has repeatedly vowed that Turkey will thwart any attempt by the YPG to carve out a Kurdish state in northern Syria, leaving open the possibility of a cross-border operation to prise the town of Afrin from Kurdish control.  ""Turkey will not allow a terror corridor reaching the Mediterranean in northern Syria,"" Erdogan told reporters on his plane back from a visit to Jordan. ""Whatever the price, we will conduct the necessary intervention,"" he said, quoted by the Hurriyet newspaper on Wednesday.  Last August, Ankara launched a cross-border operation in northern Syria aimed at clearing the border zone of both YPG fighters and militants.  ""Our determination on the issue of Afrin is the same. It is going as we planned right now,"" Erdogan said, without giving further details.  Complaining about Washington's arming of the YPG, Erdogan said up to 1,000 trucks had crossed from Iraq to Syria carrying weapons for the SDF, which Turkey fears will reach the PKK.  The rise of militants in the Syrian northwestern province of Idlib has also caused concern in Ankara, Moscow and Tehran.  Erdogan alluded to plans for Idlib, controlled by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant alliance, but would not elaborate, only saying: ""What is there now? There is Idlib.""  'CANCEL KURDISH REFERENDUM'    US officials said Tuesday that the grinding fight was the ""priority"" in the campaign against IS since the fall last month of Mosul, the militants' Iraqi hub.  The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq - whose peshmerga security forces are playing a key role in the fight against IS - is planning its own independence referendum in September.  But at the date approaches, the plan is fuelling increasing discomfort in the region.  Mattis met Tuesday with Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani in Erbil to express US opposition to the referendum.  And Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, in Baghdad on Wednesday to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other Iraqi officials, reiterated Turkey's opposition to the referendum.  ""We have informed them that their decision is wrong ... Our expectation is clear and simple. This referendum decision should be cancelled,"" Cavusoglu said.  Cavusoglu will also go to meet Barzani in Arbil, where he said he would tell the autonomous government in person his views.  The US is also concerned about signs of warming ties between Iran and Turkey, whose relationship in the past has been far from straightforward.  Iranian armed forces chief General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri visited Turkey last week, with both sides agreeing to step up regional security and oppose the Kurdish referendum.  Erdogan on Monday said a joint operation with Iran against Kurdish militants based in Iraq was ""always on the agenda"", but Iran's Revolutionary Guards denied the claim.",en,terrorattack,,

The fighting - still going on in some areas - marked a major escalation in a simmering conflict in the northwestern state since last October, when similar attacks prompted a big military sweep beset by allegations of serious human rights abuses.  The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a group previously known as Harakah al-Yaqin, which instigated the October attacks, claimed responsibility for the early morning offensive, and warned of more.  The treatment of approximately 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya has emerged as majority Buddhist Myanmar's most contentious human rights issue as it makes a transition from decades of harsh military rule.  It now appears to have spawned a potent insurgency which has grown in size, observers say.  They worry that the attacks - much larger and better organised than those in October - will spark an even more aggressive army response and trigger communal clashes between Muslims and Buddhist ethnic Rakhines.  Advertisement  Advertisement  A news team affiliated with the office of national leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said that one soldier, one immigration officer, 10 policemen and 59 insurgents had been killed in the fighting.  ""In the early morning at 1 a.m., the extremist Bengali insurgents started their attack on the police post ... with the man-made bombs and small weapons,"" said the army in a separate statement, referring to the Rohingya by a derogatory term implying they are interlopers from Bangladesh.  The militants also used sticks and swords and destroyed bridges with explosives, the army said.  The Rohingya are denied citizenship and are seen by many in Myanmar as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite claiming roots in the region that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and occasionally subjected to communal violence.  FIRE AND FEAR  The military counter-offensive in October resulted in some 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, where they joined many others who have fled from Myanmar over the past 25 years.  The United Nations said Myanmar's security forces likely committed crimes against humanity in the offensive that began in October. On Friday, the United Nations condemned the militant attacks and called for all parties to refrain from violence.  The military said about 150 Rohingya attacked an army base in Taung Bazar village in Buthidaung township.  Among the police posts attacked was a station in the majority-Rakhine village of Kyauk Pandu, 40 km (24 miles) south of the major town of Maungdaw.  Police officer Kyaw Win Tun said the insurgents burned down the post and police had been called to gather at a main station.  Residents were fearful as darkness approached.  ""We heard that a lot of Muslim villagers are grouping together, they will make more attacks on us when the sun goes down,"" said Maung Maung Chay, a Rakhine villager from the hamlet.  The attack took place hours after a panel led by the former U.N. chief Kofi Annan advised the government on long-term solutions for the violence-riven state.  Annan condemned the violence on Friday, saying ""no cause can justify such brutality and senseless killing"".  'RUNNING FOR OUR LIVES'  Military sources told Reuters they estimated 1,000 insurgents took part in the offensive and it encompassed both Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships - a much wider area compared with October.  The leader of ARSA, Ata Ullah, has said hundreds of young Rohingya have joined the group, which claims to be waging a legitimate defence against the army and for human rights.  ""We have been taking our defensive actions against the Burmese marauding forces in more than 25 different places across the region. More soon!"" the group said on Twitter.  Chris Lewa of the Rohingya monitoring group, the Arakan Project, said a major concern was what happened to some 700 Rohingya villagers trapped inside their section of Zay Di Pyin village which had been surrounded by Rakhine vigilantes armed with sticks and swords.  ""We are running for our lives,"" said one of the Zay Di Pyin's Rohingya villagers reached by telephone, adding that houses had been set on fire. The government said the village had been burned down but blamed the fire on the Rohingya.  Amid rising tension over the past few weeks, more than 1,000 new refugees have fled to Bangladesh, where border guards on Friday pushed back 146 people trying to flee the violence.  Mohammed Shafi, who lives in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, said his cousin in Myanmar had told him of the trouble.  ""The military is everywhere. People are crying, mourning the dead,"" Shafi said.  ""Things are turning real bad. It's scary.""  (Additional Krishna N.

New Delhi, India - Hussain Johar sits in the corner shop where he sells cigarettes in New Delhi's Madanpur Khadar area, a sprawling urban village along the bank of the Yamuna River.  The 17-year-old is one of the more than 200 Rohingya who have made this working class district their home over the past five years.  But now a plan by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deport the approximately 40,000 Rohingya estimated to be living across India back to neighbouring Myanmar has sent shockwaves through his community.  The Rohingya are a majority-Muslim ethnic group, often described as ""the world's most persecuted minority"", who have lived for centuries in the majority Buddhist Myanmar, where they have faced growing violence and persecution that has forced hundreds of thousands to flee to neighbouring countries.  ""Innocent people are being killed and facing genocide in our home country. In this situation, how can you expect us to go back?"" asks Johar, who fled the town of Buthidaung in Rakhine State, where nearly all of the Rohingya in Myanmar live and which they are not allowed to leave without government permission, following violence in 2012.  ""However, in the future, if normalcy returns, we would definitely prefer to go back to our homeland,"" he adds.  Plan challenged in court  The government's plan has been challenged in the Supreme Court, but 24-year-old Rohingya Mohammad Shakil, who also runs a corner shop, is worried.  ""We are so scared by the recent government plan to send us back to Myanmar. How can we go to our home country if the ... genocide and violence continue?"" he asks.  ""We would prefer to die here [in India] than return.""  READ MORE: Who are the Rohingya?  The petition to India's Supreme Court, the top court in the country, argues that the proposed deportation would violate Article 14 (the Right to Equality) and Article 21 (the Right to Life) of the Constitution of India. It adds that India is a signatory to various conventions that recognise the principle of ""non-refoulement"", which prohibits forcing refugees to return to places where their lives might be at risk.  The horror continues. More villages in south Maungdaw razed today. I'm told 80 percent of villages in Maungdaw township are gone. Ã¢â‚¬â€ Matthew Smith (@matthewfsmith) September 4, 2017  On Monday, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, criticised India over its plan to deport Rohingya, telling the UN Human Rights Council: ""India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations.""  As it is a fundamental principle of customary international law, non-refoulement is binding on all states whether or not they have signed the UN Refugee Convention, to which India is not a signatory.  Growing violence against the Rohingya  The Myanmar armed forces, known as Tatmadaw, launched a bloody crackdown on the Rohingya late last month after some of its soldiers were attacked by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a group which says it is obligated to ""defend, salvage and protect [the] Rohingya community"". The Myanmar government considers the ARSA to be a ""terrorist"" organisation, a designation it rejects.  Hundreds of Rohingya have been killed, and nearly 300,000 have been forced to flee to Bangladesh since August 25, as Rohingya villages have been burned down by the Myanmar army.  Last week, Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a non-profit human rights organisation based in Southeast Asia, tweeted that 80 percent of the town of Maungdaw, which is in Rakhine State and borders Bangladesh, may have been burned down.  In 2015, the party of the long-incarcerated opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi came to power, ending decades of military government rule, but she has remained silent over the attacks on Rohingya even as the UN's Al-Hussein has called it a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".  In Madanpur Khadar, an atmosphere of fear prevails, and most Rohingya residents are reluctant to speak to journalists. But 32-year-old Tasleema, who fled Rakhine State in 2012 and asked to give only one name, wants to talk about how some Rohingya women and girls are sexually assaulted as they flee the country.  ""How can people, particularly women and girls, return amid sexual assaults, including rapes by the army in broad daylight?"" she asks, adding that ""no action has ever been taken against the army"" for the atrocities it has committed.  Does India want to deport Rohingya because they are Muslim?  Mohammad Haroon, who runs a small grocery store, is hopeful. ""People in India have been very supportive,"" the 45-year-old says.  Two charities, the Zakat Foundation of India (ZFI) and Don Bosco, have been working to help the Rohingya in New Delhi.  Zafar Mahmood, the president of ZFI, says 210 Rohingya are living in Madanpur Khadar on land provided by his organisation. ""We are hosting them because it is our moral and religious duty,"" Mahmood explains.  India is host to more than 300,000 refugees from neighbouring countries, but Mahmood says Rohingya are being targeted for deportation because most are Muslim.  ""It fits into the larger policy that any Hindu coming from anywhere is welcome and can get a long-term visa, but if a Muslim is coming then there is a difficulty,"" he says.  Rights activists have criticised the government over a controversial citizenship law that includes a provision for welcoming refugees facing persecution, specifying ""Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan"", but notably excludes Muslims.  ""The Citizen Amendments Bill allowed persecuted people from the Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist faiths to get Indian citizenship, but Muslims were not allowed even if they were persecuted,"" explains Apoorvanand Jha, an academic and activist based in the Indian capital, New Delhi.  Last week Modi visited Myanmar - his second visit in three years - and held talks with Aung San Suu Kyi in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. A joint statement issued at the end of their talks failed to mention the brutal military crackdown on the Rohingya.  In a blog last week, Mani Shankar Aiyer, a former cabinet minister and member of the opposition Congress party, accused the Modi government of ending India's ""golden tradition"" of opening its doors to refugees.  ""Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ if we can assure indefinite refuge to uncounted generations of Tibetans, unnumbered Afghans and hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils refugees, why not a few thousand Rohingya?"" he wrote.  India's ties with Myanmar  But some foreign policy experts say India's closeness to Myanmar is motivated by security and strategic interests. New Delhi wants the Tatmadaw to deny haven to Indian armed groups that operate along the 1,600km border between the two countries. And as part of its ""Act East"" policy, the Modi government is seeking to build economic, strategic, political and cultural partnerships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, among them Myanmar.  ""India has significant geopolitical and security interests that continue to shape its outreach to Myanmar. As China's profile continues to rise in India's vicinity, New Delhi would like to enhance India's presence by developing infrastructure and connectivity projects in the country,"" wrote Harsh V Pant, a professor of international relations at the Defence Studies Department and the India Institute at King's College London, in an article in the Diplomat.  In 2016, India built a port in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State. It is currently constructing a highway that will connect Moreh in India with Mae Sot in Thailand via Myanmar. And it has plans to further boost military and economic cooperation with the country, to which it sells a wide range of defence equipment.  In July, the commander-in-chief of Myanmar's armed forces and a top navy delegation visited India.  But Apoorvanand believes the Hindutva ideology of the ruling BJP is also a significant factor in the government's bid to deport Rohingya.  ""The way Rohingya question is being projected confirms the nonsensical Hindu view that Muslims are out to overtake this country,"" he says. ""Muslims are seen as a threat.""

Only Sanofi Pasteur is accredited to distribute the vaccine in the country.  Published 2:00 PM, September 13, 2017  MANILA, Philippines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Both the Department of Health (DOH) and the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines (PIDSP) said there is no reason for the public to panic over the mosquito-borne disease Japanese encephalitis.  ""Yes, no need to panic! We are seeing less cases this year!"" Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial told Rappler in a text message on Wednesday, September 13.  She said the DOH is also planning to include the Japanese encephalitis vaccine in its free immunization program by next year.  Dr Salvacion Gatchalian, PIDSP vice president, also allayed growing fears online that there is a shortage of vaccine for the disease.  ""There is no need to panic because in fact, physicians have actually been giving this vaccine at least in private practice because it's recommended in our immunization schedule already since 2016,"" said Gatchalian during a forum about Japanese encephalitis held at the Dusit Thani Manila hotel in Makati City on Wednesday.  Japanese encephalitis involves the inflammation of the brain. The disease is passed on to humans through the bite of the Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquito, which is active during the day and night.  Persons bitten by this mosquito may not register symptoms 5 to 15 days after being bitten. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Severe cases include neck stiffness, seizures, paralysis, and comatose that may lead to death.  In the past days, the disease has been a hot topic on social media, which Gatchalian said led to ""misinformation"" that cases of Japanese encephalitis have increased and there is a shortage of the vaccine against it.  The DOH, however, said only 133 cases have been recorded as of August 26, which is 44% lower than the data recorded during the same period last year. Of these cases, only 9 have died.  Sanofi Pasteur country regulatory affairs head Jervin Papelleras also said there is no scarcity of the vaccine, though they are exerting extra effort to immediately deliver more of it to authorized channels.  His company is the only one accredited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to distribute the Japanese encephalitis vaccine in the Philippines.  ""The company is exerting all efforts to meet this increase in demand for the vaccine. We expect that supply of this vaccine to the public will normalize very soon,"" Papelleras said.  Warning vs buying vaccine online  Following the public's concerns, Japanese encephalitis vaccines are now being sold online. But the FDA issued an advisory against buying the vaccine from unauthorized dealers.  Gatchalian warned parents that buying the vaccine online could be risky for their children.  ""They have to make sure they only buy it from the one licensed by the FDA. Sometimes other people import vaccines to the Philippines. But the FDA has not analyzed these, so we're not sure if they're safe,"" said Gatchalian in Filipino.  For now, the safest way to avail of the vaccine is to buy it straight from the doctor who will administer the shot. The DOH estimates the price of each dose between P2,000 and P4,000.  ""It is administered subcutaneously as a single dose for those 9 months and older. For individuals 9 months to 17 years of age, a booster dose is recommended 12 to 24 months after the primary dose,"" said Sanofi in a statement.  Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella also said the government is ""closely monitoring"" cases of Japanese encephalitis.  ""We encourage the local government units to report and notify suspect cases of Japanese encephalitis,"" said Abella. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,diseas,,

Damascus and Hezbollah allowed nearly 300 lightly armed militants and 300 relatives to leave the Syria-Lebanon border in a surrender deal, after an offensive there last month.  The transfer marked the first time Islamic State publicly agreed to such an evacuation from territory it held.  A U.S.-led coalition had stopped the 17 buses from reaching Deir al-Zor for weeks and the convoy split in two. It was not immediately clear if all the buses arrived in Islamic State territory in the eastern Syrian province on Wednesday.  ""The deal has been completed,"" said the commander in the military alliance fighting in support of the Damascus government.  The buses took the route between the town of al-Sukhna and Deir al-Zor, a main road that the Syrian army and allied forces captured in recent days, the commander said.  Along the route, the combatants swapped the evacuees for a Hezbollah prisoner who had been in Islamic State captivity, the non-Syrian commander added.  Under the evacuation deal in August, Islamic State militants left their border foothold after a week-long battle in return for safe passage to Deir al-Zor province in Syria.  Iran-backed Hezbollah has played a major role in fighting Sunni militants along the border. Since early in the six-year Syrian conflict, it has sent thousands of fighters to support President Bashar al-AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government.  Lebanon's Shi'ite Hezbollah retrieved the remains of some of its forces killed in Syria as part of the swap, and was meant to get back one of its fighters that Islamic State held captive.  The deal included recovering the bodies of nine Lebanese soldiers that Islamic State captured in 2014.  The transfer ended any insurgent presence from the Syrian war on the frontier, where the Lebanese army also fought the militants in a separate offensive on its side.  But the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State blocked the convoy from entering IS territory in east Syria, near the border with Iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges.  The convoy split in two, with 11 buses remaining in the open desert and others retreating into government territory.  Last week, the U.S. coalition said its surveillance aircraft moved away from the buses in the no-man's land after pro-Syrian government forces ""advanced past"" the convoy. Damascus was responsible for the evacuees, it said.  The Syrian army and its allies reached Deir al-Zor city, breaking an Islamic State siege of an enclave there that had lasted three years.  U.S.-backed Syrian militias have also launched a separate assault in another part of Deir al-Zor province, which has become Islamic State's last major foothold in Syria. REUTERS",en,terrorattack,,

DHAKA/YANGON: The United Nations appealed on Thursday for massive help for nearly 400,000 Muslims from Myanmar who have fled to Bangladesh, with concern growing that the number could keep rising, unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as ""ethnic cleansing"".  The Rohingya are fleeing from a Myanmar military offensive in the western state of Rakhine that was triggered by a series of guerrilla attacks on Aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.  The United Nations has called for a massive intensification of relief operations to help the refugees, and a much bigger response from the international community.  ""We urge the international community to step up humanitarian support and come up with help,"" Mohammed Abdiker, director of operations and emergencies for the International Organisation for Migration, told a news conference in the Bangladeshi capital. The need was ""massive"", he added.  The violence in Rakhine and the exodus of refugees is the most pressing problem Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced since becoming national leader last year.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects such accusations, saying it is targeting ""terrorists"".  Numerous Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine have been torched but authorities have denied that security forces or Buddhist civilians set the fires. They blame the insurgents, and say 30,000 non-Muslim villagers were also displaced.  Smoke was rising from at least five places on the Myanmar side of the border on Thursday, a Reuters reporter in Bangladesh said. It was not clear what was burning or who set the fires.  ""Ethnic cleansing"" is not recognised as an independent crime under international law, the U.N. Office on Genocide Prevention says, but it has been used in U.N. resolutions and acknowledged in judgements and indictments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  A U.N. panel of experts defined it as ""rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups"".  The crisis has raised questions about Suu Kyi's commitment to human rights, and could strain relations with Western backers supporting her leadership of Myanmar's transition from decades of strict military rule and economic isolation.  Critics have called for her to be stripped of her Nobel prize for failing to do more to halt the strife, though national security remains firmly in the hands of the military.  Suu Kyi is due to address the nation on Tuesday.  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas affected by violence.  Suu Kyi ""agreed with the need for immediate and improved access of humanitarian assistance to the region, particularly by the International Red Cross, and she conveyed that she is working towards that end"", McConnell said on the Senate floor.  'INTERNAL AFFAIR'  China, which competes with the United States for influence in Myanmar, endorses the offensive against the insurgents and deemed it an ""internal affair"", Myanmar state media said.  ""The counterattacks of Myanmar security forces against extremist terrorists and the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s undertakings to provide assistance to the people are strongly welcomed,"" the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted China's ambassador, Hong Liang, as telling government officials.  But at the United Nations in New York, China set a different tone, joining a Security Council expression of concern about reports of violence and urging steps to end it.  The Security Council met on Wednesday to discuss the crisis and later ""expressed concern about reports of excessive violence ... and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem"".  This week, the Trump administration called for protection of civilians.  Bangladesh says the refugees will have to go home and has called for safe zones in Myanmar. Myanmar says safe zones are unacceptable.  The IOM's Abdiker declined to say how many refugees he thought might end up in Bangladesh.  ""The number may rise to 600,000, 700,000, even one million if the situation in Myanmar does not improve,"" he said.  The most important thing was that the refugees be able to go home safely, said George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency.  ""The international community has to support to ensure their return ... peacefully and with safety,"" he told the news conference.  On Wednesday, the Myanmar government said 45 places had been burnt. It did not provide details, but a spokesman said out of 471 villages in the north of Rakhine, 176 had been deserted and at least some people had left 34 more.  The spokesman, Zaw Htay, said the people going to Bangladesh were either linked to the insurgents, or women and children fleeing conflict.  Government figures show 432 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, since Aug. 25.  There are also fears of a humanitarian crisis on the Myanmar side of the border. The government has accused some aid groups of helping the insurgents and has restricted access.

The strike in Mudiyah district in Abyan province on the Arabian Sea coast had targeted a motorcycle which the suspected militants were riding, the official said.  Abyan is one of several provinces in central and southern Yemen where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and its local affiliate Ansar al-Sharia operate.  AQAP has taken advantage of a more than two-year civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country.  The United States has repeatedly attacked AQAP with aircraft and unmanned drones in what U.S. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group's ability to coordinate attacks abroad.  The Saudi-led coalition supporting Hadi has also launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis which control Yemen's capital and much of the country's north.

The coalition spokesman said on Thursday that a Saudi pilot had died a day earlier when his plane crashed in the southern province of Abyan due to ""technical failure"", the Saudi news agency SPA said.  The war has killed more than 10,000 people.  (Reporting by Mohammed Mokhashaf; Editing by Alison Williams)",en,terrorattack,,

YANGON: Myanmar said on Friday a visiting U.S. official would not be allowed to go to a region where violence has triggered an exodus of nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims that the United Nations has branded a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".  The Rohingya have fled from western Rakhine state to neighbouring Bangladesh to escape a military offensive that has raised questions about Myanmar's transition to civilian rule under the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.  U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy will voice Washington's concerns about the Rohingya and press for greater access to the conflict area for humanitarian workers, the State Department said.  Myanmar officials said he would meet government leaders in the capital, Naypyitaw, and attend an address to the nation by Suu Kyi on Tuesday.  He would also visit Sittwe, the state capital, and meet the governor of Rakhine, the state government secretary, Tin Maung Swe, told Reuters, but the north of the state, where the conflict erupted on Aug. 25 would be off limits.  ""Not allowed,"" Tin Maung Swe said, when asked if Murphy would be going to Maungdaw district, at the heart of the strife that began when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen people.  Advertisement  Advertisement  While nearly 400,000 refugees have poured across the border into Bangladesh, fears have also been growing of a humanitarian crisis on the Myanmar side, but access for aid workers and reporters has been severely restricted.  Myanmar insisted on Friday it was not barring aid workers but a government spokesman said authorities on the ground might have concerns over security.  Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population.  A Reuters photographer on the Bangladesh side of the border said he could see huge banks of dark smoke billowing up over Myanmar territory on Friday, while international aid organisations said the refugees kept coming.  ""ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really no sign that this flow of people is going to dry up,"" Chris Lom of the International Organisation for Migration, said from the Bangladeshi border district of CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bazar.  ""There are still, we believe, thousands of people waiting to take boats across to Cox's Bazar.Ã¢â‚¬Â  'SCORCHED EARTH'  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.  Myanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar, though smaller, attacks in October.  The government has declared it a terrorist organisation and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians.  Ethnic cleansing is not recognised as a separate crime under international law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts.  Rights group Amnesty International said evidence pointed to a ""mass-scale scorched-earth campaign"" across the north of Rakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing.  ""The evidence is irrefutable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Myanmar security forces are setting northern Rakhine state ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar,"" said Tirana Hassan, the group's crisis response director.  The group said it had detected 80 big fires in Rohingya areas since Aug. 25. While the extent of damage could not be verified, due to access restrictions by the government, ""they are likely to have burnt down whole villages"".  It said it also had credible reports of Rohingya militants burning the homes of ethnic Rakhine and other minorities. About 30,000 non-Muslims have also been displaced.  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas in Myanmar affected by violence.  The generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticised abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence. The campaign against the Muslim insurgents is popular at home.  The U.N. refugee agency said the Rohingya arriving in Bangladesh were suffering ""real hardship, and some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation"".  ""With the influx increasing daily, UNHCR is appealing for an initial amount of US$30 million for the emergency humanitarian response in Bangladesh until the end of year,"" an agency spokesman said in Geneva.  Bangladesh says all refugees must go home and has called for safe areas in Myanmar. Myanmar has ruled that out and says it will accept anyone who can verify their citizenship. Most Rohingya are stateless.  Thousands of people demonstrated after Friday prayers in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, to denounce the treatment of the Rohingya.  One protest leader said they were demanding a U.N. peace-keeping force and that Myanmar face charges in an international court.

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump sparked fury in London and yet another pointed rebuke from Prime Minster Theresa May Friday (Sep 15) after he claimed ""loser terrorists"" behind a botched London train attack were known to British police.  Trump took to Twitter to condemn an attack on a packed London Underground train that injured 22 people, but also appeared to suggest the UK authorities had dropped the ball.  ""Another attack in London by a loser terrorist,"" the US president tweeted. ""These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!"" Trump said, appearing to reveal undisclosed intelligence from the headquarters of London's Metropolitan police force.  That electronic broadside brought a terse public response from May, who warned the US president and others not to speculate.  ""I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,"" May told journalists in London.  Trump's latest comments were similarly described as ""unhelpful"" by London's Metropolitan Police.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Nick Timothy, May's former chief of staff, also branded the US leader's tweet ""unhelpful.""  ""True or not - and I'm sure he doesn't know - this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner,"" Timothy wrote on Twitter.  Trump's keenness to underline a series of UK terror attacks, virtually in real time, has led to repeated outcry across the Atlantic that has helped indefinitely delay his much-vaunted state visit to Britain.  In May, British officials were furious after their US counterparts leaked shared material about an investigation into a bomb attack at a concert by pop star Ariana Grande in Manchester which left 22 dead.  The bomber's identity and details of the probe leaked to US media before British officials felt ready to disclose them.  TRUMP RENEWS CALL FOR TRAVEL BAN  After an attack in London last June, Trump lashed London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan for telling the public there was ""no reason to be alarmed"" over armed police on the streets.  On that occasion, Prime Minister May was forced to upbraid Trump, saying ""I think Donald Trump is wrong in what he said about Sadiq Khan in the aftermath of the London Bridge attack.""  In March, the White House left UK spooks apoplectic when it cited unproven media reports that President Barack Obama had asked Britain's signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, to monitor then-candidate Trump in order to ""make sure there were no American fingerprints.""  The normally tight-lipped agency called the allegations ""nonsense,"" adding that ""they are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.""  Trump on Friday also used the London train attack to renew calls for his controversial ban on travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries - a rallying cry of his right-wing base who have recently been angered by his support for an amnesty for some migrants.  ""The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific - but stupidly, that would not be politically correct,"" the president said in a series of tweets.  ""Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner. The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!"" he added, without elaborating.  But that domestic political message risked upending the decades old trans-Atlantic relationship.  Speaking in London on Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hailed a relationship that is ""as special today as it has ever been.""  That premise looks set to be tested when Trump, as he also announced Friday, calls May to discuss the attack in the coming days.",en,terrorattack,,

Nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims from western Myanmar have crossed into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, fleeing a Myanmar government offensive against insurgents that the United Nations has branded a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".  Bangladesh said Myanmar drones and helicopters had violated its air space three times - on Sept. 10, 12 and 14 - and it had called in a top Myanmar embassy official in Dhaka to complain.  ""Bangladesh expressed deep concern at the repetition of such acts of provocation and demanded that Myanmar takes immediate measures to ensure that such violation of sovereignty does not occur again,"" the ministry said in statement late on Friday.  ""These provocative acts may lead to unwarranted consequences.""  A Myanmar government spokesman said he did not have information about the incidents Bangladesh had complained about but Myanmar had denied an earlier accusation.  The spokesman, Zaw Htay, said Myanmar would check any information that Bangladesh provided.  ""At this time, our two countries are facing the refugee crisis. We need to collaborate with good understanding,"" Zaw Htay told Reuters on Saturday.  Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are regarded as illegal migrants and denied citizenship.  Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya before the latest crisis erupted on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen people.  The Myanmar security forces responded with what rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say is a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population.  The conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the border and raised questions about Myanmar's path under the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi after nearly 50 years of strict military rule.  The generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticised abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence.  There is little sympathy for the Rohingya in a country where the end of military rule has unleashed old animosities and the military campaign in Rakhine State is widely supported.  Rohingya refugee crisis - http://tmsnrt.rs/2eS8B9B  'STRONGHOLD'  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.  Myanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which claimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar, though smaller, attacks in October.  The government has declared ARSA a terrorist organisation and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians.  The ARSA says it is fighting for the rights of Rohingya and has denied links to foreign Islamists.  Myanmar's army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, said the violence - 93 clashes since Aug. 25 - was a bid by the insurgents to ""build a stronghold"", according to speech to officer trainees, posted on a military Facebook page.  Min Aung Hlaing called on the military to abide by all laws and regulations, including the Geneva Conventions, and said the media should be united and the people should not ""rely on foreign organisations"". He did not elaborate.  More than 430 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, and about 30,000 non-Muslim villagers have been displaced, the government said. Dozens of places have been burned and nearly half of the 471 villages in the north of Rakhine had been completely or partly deserted, it said.  The United States has called for the protection of civilians and a deputy assistant secretary of state, Patrick Murphy, is due in Myanmar next week.  China, which also vies for influence in Myanmar, joined a U.N. Security Council call for an end to the violence while its ambassador in Myanmar expressed his support for the government's action, Myanmar media reported.  Ethnic cleansing is not recognised as a separate crime under international law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts.  Separately, the Committee to Protect Journalists has called on Bangladesh to release two Myanmar journalists detained last week while covering the refugee crisis. A police official told Reuters the two were found to be working on tourist visas and police were investigating.

Just over a week after Hurricane Irma devastated the island and neighbouring St Barthelemy, killing 15 people, pools of stagnant water and mounds of trash seem to be the new normal.  Add to that the absence of fresh running water, and the situation is ripe for a health epidemic.  ""Yes, there are risks of outbreaks,"" said Annick Girardin, the French minister for overseas affairs, who spent a week on St Martin following the Category five storm. ""There is an existing problem on the issue of contaminated water, the issue of trash, basically the issue of hygiene.""  In poorer neighbourhoods where many families were not able to evacuate, residents fear the spread of mosquitoes - which can carry diseases ranging from Zika and dengue fever to chikungunya.  ""My son has a fever maybe due to a mosquito,"" said Natacha, a resident in the Sandy Ground neighbourhood near Marigot. ""We will have to clean to prevent too many mosquitoes, or else there will be outbreaks. But it's difficult without water.""  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""If we get sick, we'll have to go to Guadeloupe"".  According to an AFP journalist, in some neighbourhoods like Concordia, control programs had begun on Wednesday.  BOILING WATER    The island, which is still struggling to get its electricity and telecommunications systems back up and running, has found it difficult to reach residents and warn them about the potential health risks.  To get the word out, the French government has distributed notices and posters in French, Spanish, English and Creole.  Still, French health minister Agnes Buzyn said, ""We realise there are people on the island, in certain neighbourhoods, who are not following health instructions"".  One of the most important notices reminds people that only bottled water is safe to consume, and that if it is unavailable, boiling water before use is paramount.  ""We hand out fresh water all over the territory, but it remains difficult,"" Buzyn said. ""There are zones not easily accessed, people that maybe we haven't been able to reach.""  According to the government, 150,000 bottles of water are being distributed to residents every day.  But some people have still been fetching water directly from a reservoir.  A desalination plant destined for St Martin arrived Friday on Pointe-a-Pitre, on the French island of Guadeloupe, about 300 kilometres (185 miles) away.  It will continue its journey to the hurricane-hit island by barge and is expected to be operational by Sep 25, the authorities said.  Meanwhile drinking water has returned to St Barts, which is now able to produce about 800 cubic metres (176,000 gallons) a day.  ""We are not yet at a level of signalling an outbreak, far from it,"" Buzyn said. ""Today, it's mostly an individual risk, which means it is essential that people who live on St Martin drink the bottled water that is distributed"".  Buzyn had said last Wednesday that there had been some cases of children with diarrhoea, but did not mention any signs of an outbreak.  RACING THE CLOCK    Medical epidemiologists are aware of and on the lookout for any sign of outbreaks, and will regularly track patients using health surveys, said Guadeloupe's public health director Patrice Richard.  On Saturday, St Martin's health services coordinator Sergio Albarello said there had been no cases of outbreak on the island.  ""As of now, there have been no reported cases"" of outbreak, he told reporters, adding that as far as mosquitoes, ""we are not talking about carriers of genes that are epidemiologically relevant"".  And while many buildings were flattened by the storm, the St Martin hospital is still able to treat people ""in excellent conditions"", even though one of its buildings was partially destroyed.  Philippe Gustin, the French envoy in charge of the islands' reconstruction, said the immediate plan was to fix the damaged buildings.  According to Gustin, about 30 per cent of the buildings on the French side of the island were completely destroyed, but he cautioned that teams were still putting together a final estimate of damages - which has been put at Ã¢â€šÂ¬1 billion (US$1.2 billion) or more for roads and buildings.  But repairing them before the high season, which usually starts in November and runs until April, seems nearly impossible.  Cleaning up also remains a priority for St Martin, particularly in areas where rats could proliferate.  Home to some 35,000 people, St Martin - whose livelihood rests almost entirely on tourists - attracts around two million visitors a year, most of them American cruise ship passengers.  While visiting St Barts this past week, French President Emmanuel Macron promised emergency financial aid for those ""who have lost everything"".  As for the Dutch side of the island, the Dutch Red Cross said Saturday that it had collected Ã¢â€šÂ¬13.3 millions following a weeklong donation drive.",en,diseas,,

An 18-year-old man was detained at Dover port, one of the country's main links to Europe, with officers describing the development as a significant step in their investigation.  They later announced that the raid was under way.  ""Police officers have evacuated and are searching a residential address in Sunbury, Surrey,"" a statement said.  Thirty people were treated in hospital after the bomb detonated in a packed train carriage on Friday morning, in what was Britain's fifth terror attack in 6 months.  The improvised explosive device in a train at Parsons Green station Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a quiet and wealthy residential district, filled with chic cafes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ failed to detonate fully, according to media reports.  But the blast inflicted flash burns on passengers while others fled in panic.  Police in Dover said the teenager arrested on Saturday would be transferred to custody in London.  ""This arrest will lead to more activity from our officers,"" said a statement, outlining that the man was being held under anti-terror legislation.  Friday's incident Ã¢â‚¬â€œ claimed by the Islamic State group (ISIS) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ led to Britain's terror threat level being raised to critical Ã¢â‚¬â€œ meaning another attack could be imminent.  Prime Minister Theresa May announced late Friday that troops Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1,000 were deployed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ would take on responsibility for guarding key sites, including nuclear facilities, to free up police.  In a statement, anti-terrorism chief Mark Rowley said on Friday that officers were ""chasing down suspects"".  ""Somebody has planted this improvised explosive device on the Tube.

An estimated 400,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh in the past three weeks to escape a surge of violence in MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rakhine state, home to a Muslim minority for centuries.  The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid RaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœad al-Hussein, has described the violence as Ã¢â‚¬Å“textbook ethnic cleansingÃ¢â‚¬Â at the hands of the army and local militias, who retaliated against the civilian population following an Rohingya insurgent attack on security forces on August 25, resulting in 71 deaths, at least 59 militants and 12 soldiers.  Smoke in Myanmar is seen from Bangladesh on September 14, 2017 in Shah Porir Dip, Bangladesh. Around 400,000 Rohingya refugees have fled into Bangladesh since late August during the outbreak of violence in the Rakhine state. Allison Joyce/Getty Images  Ã¢â‚¬Å“No one has any hope of return,Ã¢â‚¬Â Tejshree Thapa, senior South Asia researcher for the U.S.-based NGO Human Rights Watch, tells Newsweek a few days after she returned from the region.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The reality on the ground is much much worse than any image can describe. The sheer scale of it is beyond belief,Ã¢â‚¬Â she says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I've worked with a lot of refugees but I've never seen a group this devastated, this destroyed. It's incredibly bleak.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The suffering the Rohingya are experiencing in recent weeks isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t new. MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest minority, they have been persecuted for decades. They have survived waves of ethnically-motivated violence by the military government, which has progressively deprived them of basic human rights.  The reason for this hatred, according to human rights activists, is simple: nationalism-fuelled racism.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rohingyas have been facing genocide for many years,Ã¢â‚¬Â human rights activist and president of Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, Tun Khin, tells Newsweek.  He explains that the group is an easy target for MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultra-nationalists: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rohingyas are a different ethnic group, they have a different appearance and religion.Ã¢â‚¬Â  A Rohingya Muslim woman who fled from ongoing military operations in Myanmars Rakhine state, gets off a boat after crossing over from Myanmar into the Bangladesh side of the border. Onur Coban/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  When MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â€known as Burma at the timeÃ¢â‚¬â€ became independent from British rule in 1948, the Rohingya were able to participate in the political life of the country, obtaining statehood status for Rakhine in 1974. But a few years later, during 1977 and 1978, a wave of violence against Ã¢â‚¬Å“illegal immigrationÃ¢â‚¬Â forced a first mass exodus to Bangladesh.  Many Rohingya returned home a year later, but in 1982 the military regime stripped them of their citizenship rights and ethnic minority status. In 1994, it began refusing to issue birth certificates to babies born of Rohingya parents.  Even two decades later, after the military government finally allowed elections and long-term political prisoner and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi became the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s de facto leader, the Rohingya were excluded from the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s census in 2014.  Rohingya Muslim refugees disembark from a boat on the Bangladeshi side of Naf river in Teknaf on September 13, 2017. Masfiqur Sohan/NurPhoto via Getty Images  The mass exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries has occurred at least three times in the past 50 years: in 1977-78, in 1991-2 and in 2012 hundreds of thousands fled across the borders. Each time thousands returned to Rakhine when the worst of the violence was over.  In October last yearÃ¢â‚¬â€when the military carried out a campaign of Ã¢â‚¬Å“devastating crueltyÃ¢â‚¬Â as described by the U.N.Ã¢â‚¬â€against the Rohingya following a militant attack against security forces. In April, Aung San Suu Kyi denied reports of ethnic cleansing and promised Rohingya would be safe it they came back to Myanmar.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The evidence is irrefutable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Myanmar security forces are setting northern Rakhine State ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar. Make no mistake: this is ethnic cleansing,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty InternationalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crisis response director, in a statement.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is a clear and systematic pattern of abuse here. Security forces surround a village, shoot people fleeing in panic and then torch houses to the ground. In legal terms, these are crimes against humanityÃ¢â‚¬â€systematic attacks and forcible deportation of civilians,Ã¢â‚¬Â she added.  Recently arrived Rohingya refugees wait to receive aid donations on September 13, 2017 in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Allison Joyce/Getty Images)  Human Rights WatchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Thapa agrees, arguing that what makes this new wave of anti-Rohingya attacks worse than in previous years is how coordinated they are. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It feels like a programme designed to drive out everyone finally,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  As Myanmar continues to block access to the Rakhine state, Thepa spoke to some of the refugees she met in Bangladesh to document the violence. One woman from Maungdaw Township said she fled on August 26, leaving her husband and 10-year-old son, after security forces attacked her village and killed her father and many other civilians.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“All had knife wounds or bullet wounds, some had both. My father was among the dead; his neck had been cut open. I was unable to do last rites for [him]Ã¢â‚¬â€œI just fled,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  Some refugees arrived in Bangladesh on foot, crossing a border where the Myanmar army is said to be laying landmines specifically to target refugees. The government denied these reports, despite numerous claims by non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International.

Some of these vessels have capsized or sunkÃ¢â‚¬â€nine women and eleven children lost their lives in one such incident in August. Many more have died since, as demonstrated by a harrowing picture of a weeping mother holding the lifeless body of her five-week-old child.  Now, international pressure on Suu Kyi, who holds the title of State Counsellor, to stop the violence and ensure a safe return for the Rohingya is mounting. A petition on Change.org to strip her of her Nobel Peace Prize has reached almost half a million signatures but the Nobel laureate, who remains popular in the country, has shunned the international community and indicated she did not believe reports of ethnic violence.  She also recently announced she would skip the 72nd U.N. General Assembly session in New York, which opened this week.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“We want to live peacefully in our native land. We don't want to be on the strain of other countries,Ã¢â‚¬Â Tun, the U.K. based activist, said.  He wants to see the formal recognition of the Rohingya as a minority in Myanmar, the provision of humanitarian aid and the dispatch of U.N. peacekeepers to protect the Rohingya. Tun has also appealed to Suu Kyi, who knows as well as as anyone what it is to be deprived of your rights in Myanmar.

The bodies have been found since Sunday buried outside a village in Rakhine State in western Myanmar, where bloodshed erupted on Aug 25 when Rohingya Muslim insurgents launched coordinated attacks on about 30 police posts and an army camp.  The United Nations has described a sweeping military response to those attacks as ""ethnic cleansing"" aimed at driving Rohingya out of Buddhist-majority Myanmar.  Myanmar rejects that, saying it is fighting terrorists.  ""There is no ethnic cleansing. There is no genocide,"" Myanmar's U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan told the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Monday. ""The leaders of Myanmar who have long been striving for freedom and human rights would not espouse such policies.""  ""We will do everything to prevent ethnic cleansing and genocide,"" the diplomat said. ""It is the responsibility of every government to fight against terrorism and protect innocent civilians. We condemn all human rights violations and violent acts.""  Advertisement  Advertisement  Myanmar said before the mass graves were found that more than 400 people had been killed, most of them insurgents.  Members of Myanmar's small Hindu minority appear to have been caught in the middle.  Some have fled to Bangladesh, complaining of violence against them by soldiers or Buddhist vigilantes. Others have complained of being attacked by the insurgents on suspicion of being government spies.  A search was launched on the weekend after a refugee in Bangladesh contacted a Hindu community leader in Myanmar to say insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) marched about 100 people out of their village on Aug 25 and killed them, the government said.  Twenty-eight bodies were found on Sunday.  ""This afternoon, a suspicious place was found about 400 metres northeast of the mass grave where the remains of Hindus were found yesterday,"" the army said in a statement.  ""Seventeen bodies of men were retrieved.""  The government has not speculated as to why the Hindus were killed. The army said the security forces and Hindu community leaders would continue the search.  Access to the area by journalists as well as human rights workers and aid workers is largely restricted.  An ARSA spokesman denied his group had killed the Hindus, saying Buddhist nationalists were trying to divide Hindus and Muslims.  ""ARSA has internationally pledged not to target civilians and that remains unchanged, no matter what,"" the spokesman, who is based in a neighbouring country and identified himself only as Abdullah, told Reuters through a messaging service.  'SHOT, HACKED, BRUTALISED'  The violence in Rakhine State and the refugee exodus is the biggest crisis the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced since it came to power last year in a transition from nearly 50 years of military rule.  Myanmar regards the Rohingya Muslims as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and communal violence has flared periodically for decades. Most Rohingya are stateless.  In Bangladesh, the head of the U.N. refugee agency said the Rohingya seeking shelter from ""unimaginable horrors"" faced enormous hardship and risked a dramatic deterioration in circumstances unless aid was stepped up.  ""They (have) seen villages burned down, families shot or hacked to death, women and girls brutalized,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told a news conference in Dhaka after visiting camps near the border on the weekend.  ""Solutions to this crisis lie with Myanmar"", he said, though for now, the world had to help and aid should be ""rapidly stepped up"".  A Reuters reporter in Bangladesh said refugees were still arriving, with about 50 seen on Monday.  The crisis has also threatened to drive a wedge into the Association of South East Asian Nations, with Muslim-majority Malaysia disavowing a statement on the Myanmar situation from the bloc's chairman, the Philippines, on the grounds it misrepresented ""the reality"" and did not identify the Rohingya as one of the affected communities.  Myanmar, which is a member of the regional grouping, objects to the term Rohingya, saying the Muslims of Rakhine State are not a distinct ethnic group.  This month, Malaysia summoned Myanmar's ambassador to express its grave concern over ""atrocities"" there.",en,terrorattack,114,['Myanmar']

""This topic is open to negotiation and discussion and when we are done eliminating Daesh (Islamic State), we can sit with our Kurdish sons and reach an understanding on a formula for the future,"" Moualem said.  The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia controls a swathe of northern Syria where the main Kurdish party, the PYD, and its allies have established autonomy since the start of the Syrian war in 2011.  Syrian Kurds say their aim is to preserve that autonomy as part of a decentralised Syria, and they do not aim to follow the path of Kurds in Iraq who held an independence referendum on Monday.  Moualem reiterated his government's rejection of that referendum, saying Damascus supported Iraqi unity, but he noted that Syria's Kurds ""want a form of autonomy within the borders of the Syrian Arab Republic"".

While the YPG and Damascus have mostly avoided confrontation, tensions have flared as the U.S.-backed SDF and the Russian-backed Syrian army wage separate campaigns against Islamic State in Deir al-Zor province.

Mehmet Aksoy, 32, from London, who studied filmmaking at Goldsmiths, University of London, travelled from the UK to Syria in June.  He joined the Kurdish militant group, the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), and began documenting its battles against IS.  The Foreign Office has been contacted for comment.  Aladdin Sinayic a close friend of Mr Aksoy's from London, told the BBC: ""Mehmet never fought, the plan was never to fight.  ""He told me there are better ways. He wanted to tell the stories of the fighters there, he had so much respect for them, and Mehmet was loved by everybody.""  Mr Aksoy, who was of Kurdish descent, had spent the past two months filming the battle for Raqqa, publishing his work on social media and on international news outlets.  Operating from within Kurdish units he also became a key contact for western journalists like myself covering the YPG and the activities of fighters on the ground.  ""This was his dream"", Mr Sinayic said. "" I knew whatever I said would never stop him going. He wanted to tell the stories of the Syrian people and the fighters.  ""Whenever I was saying to take care of himself, he said, 'Don't worry'. He wanted to make their struggle there visible to the world.""

IS fighters drove up to the compound in two cars and shot five YPG soldiers who were guarding the base at the checkpoint.  The IS fighters then drove into the compound where Mehmet Aksoy was standing inside, and shot him and a female Kurdish journalist. YPG fighters retaliated and killed the IS attackers who had entered their base.  Around 300 of Mr Aksoy's friends and family gathered at the Kurdish Community Centre in North London in a late night vigil to pay tribute on Tuesday evening.  Mark Campbell, a close friend and member of the Kurdistan Solidarity Campaign, said: ""I was speaking to Mehmet almost every night while he was in Syria. One of the last things he was so excited about were the local elections that were taking place in Northern Syria.""  Mr Aksoy's parents are originally from Turkey and run an off-licence in Luton. They were at the vigil in Harringay, where there were emotional scenes as people paid tribute.  Friends said Mr Aksoy did not tell his parents before travelling to Syria.

He claimed that Mr Aksoy's mother always knew of his deep desire to go to Syria.

Mattis is the first member of US President Donald Trump's cabinet to visit the war-torn country since Trump pledged to stay the course in America's longest war.  In a sign of the country's continuing insecurity a volley of rockets landed on a house near Kabul international airport hours after Mattis flew in, the interior ministry said.  Five members of the same family were wounded in the assault claimed by the Taliban, which said on social media the missiles had been aimed at Mattis's plane  A stand-off between security forces and the attackers is under way.  The unannounced high-level visit comes as Afghanistan's beleaguered security forces struggle to beat back the Taliban, which has been on the offensive since the withdrawal of US-led NATO combat troops at the end of 2014.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Mattis, along with Stoltenberg, was to hold talks with President Ashraf Ghani and other top officials to discuss the US-led NATO ""train and assist"" mission designed to strengthen Afghanistan's military so it can defend the country on its own.  At a joint news conference with Ghani at the presidential palace Mattis and Stoltenberg pledged the support of US and NATO allies to the Afghan conflict and expressed determination to stop the country becoming a safe haven for terrorists.  The foreign assistance would give Afghan forces a ""compelling battlefield advantage over anything the Taliban stands to mass against"" it, Mattis told reporters.  Stoltenberg said: ""The more stable Afghanistan is the more safe we will be,"" adding that more than 15 NATO members had agreed to send additional troops.  US generals have for months been describing the situation in Afghanistan as a stalemate, despite years of support for Afghan partners, continued help from a NATO coalition and an overall cost in fighting and reconstruction to the United States of more than US$1 trillion.  The war turns 16 in October and America is pressing NATO partners to increase their own troop levels in the country to help Afghan forces get the upper hand in the grinding battle against the Taliban and the Islamic State group.  The resurgent Taliban have promised to turn Afghanistan into a ""graveyard"" for foreign forces and have been mounting deadly attacks as they maintain their grip on large swathes of the country.  As of February only about 60 per cent of Afghanistan's 407 districts were reported to be under government control, according to the US watchdog agency SIGAR.  SLAPDASH TRAINING    Under Trump's plan, the US is sending more than 3,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, on top of the 11,000 already on the ground, to train and advise the country's security forces.  NATO allies have around 5,000 troops deployed around the country.  Critics have questioned what the extra US soldiers can accomplish that previous forces - who numbered some 100,000 at the height of the fighting - were unable to.  Earlier this year Ghani ordered a near-doubling of the country's Special Operations Command - the elite fighting force spearheading Afghanistan's war against insurgents - from 17,000 as part of a four-year plan that also aims to strengthen Afghanistan's air force.  While Afghan authorities have welcomed Trump's open-ended commitment to increase US troop numbers, they know it will take time to improve the fighting abilities of their own forces.  Afghanistan's soldiers have been severely demoralised and weakened by huge casualties, desertions and corruption.  In an acknowledgement of their impotence, the government is considering a plan to train and arm 20,000 civilians to defend territories where Islamic militants have been driven out.  Earlier this week SIGAR criticised US efforts to train Afghanistan's security forces, saying they were being hampered by slapdash instruction, shoddy oversight and failures in governance.  Mattis flew to Kabul from New Delhi where he met his Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman, who made it clear that India would not deploy troops to Afghanistan as part of Trump's strategy.",en,terrorattack,,

Mattis is the first member of United States President Donald TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cabinet to visit the war-torn country since Trump pledged to stay the course in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest war.  In a sign of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing insecurity a volley of rockets landed on a house near Kabul international airport hours after Mattis flew in, the interior ministry said.  Five members of the same family were wounded in the assault.  Both the Taleban and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility.  The Taleban said on social media the missiles had been aimed at MattisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plane.  ISIS also claimed responsibility, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AMAQ news agency said, adding thatÃ¢â‚¬Å“infiltratorsÃ¢â‚¬Â used SPG-9 rockets and mortars.  A stand-off between security forces and the attackers is under way.  The unannounced high-level visit comes as AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beleaguered security forces struggle to beat back the Taleban, which has been on the offensive since the withdrawal of US-led Nato combat troops at the end of 2014.  Mattis, along with Stoltenberg, was to hold talks with President Ashraf Ghani and other top officials to discuss the US-led Nato Ã¢â‚¬Å“train and assistÃ¢â‚¬Â mission designed to strengthen AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military so it can defend the country on its own.  At a joint news conference with Ghani at the presidential palace Mattis and Stoltenberg pledged the support of US and Nato allies to the Afghan conflict and expressed determination to stop the country becoming a safe haven for terrorists.  The foreign assistance would give Afghan forces a Ã¢â‚¬Å“compelling battlefield advantage over anything the Taleban stands to mass againstÃ¢â‚¬Â it, Mattis told reporters.  Stoltenberg said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The more stable Afghanistan is the more safe we will be,Ã¢â‚¬Â adding that more than 15 Nato members had agreed to send additional troops.  US generals have for months been describing the situation in Afghanistan as a stalemate, despite years of support for Afghan partners, continued help from a Nato coalition and an overall cost in fighting and reconstruction to the United States of more than US$1 trillion (S$1.4 trillion).  The war turns 16 in October and America is pressing Nato partners to increase their own troop levels in the country to help Afghan forces get the upper hand in the grinding battle against the Taleban and ISIS group.  The resurgent Taleban have promised to turn Afghanistan into a Ã¢â‚¬Å“graveyardÃ¢â‚¬Â for foreign forces and have been mounting deadly attacks as they maintain their grip on large swathes of the country.  As of February only about 60 per cent of AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 407 districts were reported to be under government control, according to the US watchdog agency SIGAR.  SLAPDASH TRAINING  Under TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan, the US is sending more than 3,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, on top of the 11,000 already on the ground, to train and advise the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security forces.  Nato allies have around 5,000 troops deployed around the country.  Critics have questioned what the extra US soldiers can accomplish that previous forces Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who numbered some 100,000 at the height of the fighting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were unable to.  Earlier this year Ghani ordered a near-doubling of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Special Operations Command Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the elite fighting force spearheading AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war against insurgents Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from 17,000 as part of a four-year plan that also aims to strengthen AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s air force.  While Afghan authorities have welcomed TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s open-ended commitment to increase US troop numbers, they know it will take time to improve the fighting abilities of their own forces.  AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soldiers have been severely demoralised and weakened by huge casualties, desertions and corruption.  In an acknowledgement of their impotence, the government is considering a plan to train and arm 20,000 civilians to defend territories where Islamic militants have been driven out.  Earlier this week SIGAR criticised US efforts to train AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security forces, saying they were being hampered by slapdash instruction, shoddy oversight and failures in governance.  Mattis flew to Kabul from New Delhi where he met his Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman, who made it clear that India would not deploy troops to Afghanistan as part of TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategy.",en,terrorattack,,

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo  MAUNGDAW, Myanmar (Reuters) - Along the main road that stretches nearly 40 kilometres north from Maungdaw town in MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violence-riven Rakhine State, all but one of the villages that were once home to tens of thousands of people have been turned into smouldering ash.  Hundreds of cows roam through deserted settlements and charred paddy fields. Hungry dogs eat small goats. The remains of local mosques, markets and schools - once bustling with Rohingya Muslims - are silent.  Despite strict controls on access to northern Rakhine, Reuters independently travelled to parts of the most-affected area in early September, the first detailed look by reporters inside the region where the United Nations says MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security forces have carried out ethnic cleansing.  Nearly 500 people have been killed and 480,000 Rohingya have fled since Aug. 25, when attacks on 30 police posts and a military base by Muslim militants provoked a fierce army crackdown. The government has rejected allegations of arson, rape and arbitrary killings levelled against its security forces.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We were scared that the army and the police would shoot us if they found us ... so we ran away from the village,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Suyaid Islam, 32, from Yae Khat Chaung Gwa Son, near the area visited by Reuters north of Maungdaw. He was speaking by phone from a refugee camp in Bangladesh after leaving his village soon after the attacks.  Residents of his village told Reuters it had been burned down by security forces in an earlier operation against Rohingya insurgents late last year. Those that did not flee have been surviving since in makeshift shacks, eating food distributed by aid agencies.  Satellite photos showed that tens of thousands of homes in northern Rakhine have been destroyed in 214 villages, New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. The U.N. detected 20 sq km (8 sq miles) of destroyed structures.  The government said more than 6,800 houses have been set on fire. It blames the Rohingya villagers and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which staged the Aug. 25 attacks.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The information we obtained on this side is that terrorists did the burnings,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Zaw Htay, spokesman for national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.  Reuters reporters have made two trips to northern Rakhine, visiting the townships of Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung, and driving from Maungdaw through the most affected area along the main road north to the town of Kyein Chaung. (For a graphic of the area, click: tmsnrt.rs/2y8FgQ8)  The reporters talked briefly to residents but, because many were scared of being seen speaking to outsiders, most interviews were carried out by phone from outside the army operation area.  FOOD RUNNING LOW  Little aid has made it to northern Rakhine since the U.N. had to suspend operations because of the fighting and after the government suggested its food was sustaining insurgents. Convoys organised by the Red Cross have twice been stopped and searched by hostile ethnic Rakhines in the state capital Sittwe.  In U Shey Kya, where last October Rohingya residents accused the Myanmar army of raping several women, a teacher who spoke to Reuters from the village by phone said only about 100 families out of 800 households have stayed behind.  Those who remain are playing a cat-and-mouse game with the soldiers, who come to the village in the morning prompting the residents to hide in the forest and return at night.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even have food to eat for this evening. What can we do?Ã¢â‚¬Â said the teacher. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are close to the forest where we have leaves we can eat and find some water to survive.Ã¢â‚¬Â He refused to give his name because he had been warned by the authorities not to talk to reporters.  The man said escaping through bush in monsoon rain with his elderly parents, six children and pregnant wife was not an option.  Zaw Htay said the government has prioritised humanitarian assistance to the area.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If there are any locations where aid has not reached yet, people should let us know, we will try to reach them as soon as we can,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  About 30,000 non-Muslim residents of northern Rakhine have also been displaced.  Before the latest exodus there were around 1.1 million Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, mostly living in Rakhine, where they are denied citizenship and are regarded as interlopers from Bangladesh by the Buddhist majority.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“HAPPY THEYÃ¢â‚¬ËœRE GONE NOWÃ¢â‚¬Â  Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh and human rights organisations say ethnic Rakhine vigilantes have aided the military in driving out the Muslim population.  Kamal Hussein, 22, from Alel Than Kyaw, south of Maungdaw town said his village was destroyed in early September, after which he fled to Bangladesh, where he spoke to Reuters.  Hussein said Rakhine mobs Ã¢â‚¬Å“poured petrol on the houses. Then, they came out and the military fired a grenade launcher at a house to set it alightÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Government spokesman Zaw Htay said some empty buildings in the area had been burned by ethnic Rakhines. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We told the regional government to take action on that,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  The damage caused by the fires, Reuters interviews and satellite pictures show, is by far the largest in Maungdaw, where the bulk of insurgent attacks took place. Across the mostly coastal area, stretching more than 100 km (60 miles) through thick bush and monsoon-swollen streams, most villages have been burned.  Maungdaw town itself, until recently ethnically mixed with Rakhine Buddhists, Muslims and some Hindus, is now segregated, with the remaining Rohingya shuttered in their homes. Some 450 houses in Rohingya parts of the town were burned down in the first week after the attacks, HRW said citing satellite photographs.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Those who stored food, sold it and raised money to flee to Bangladesh,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mohammad Salem, 35, who used to sell cosmetics at the market, told Reuters by phone from the town.  In ethnically-mixed Rathedaung township, 16 out of 21 Rohingya villages have been burned, according to residents and humanitarian workers.  Of the remaining five, two villages in the south are now cut off from food and threatened by hostile Rakhine neighbours.  In many places people have no access to medicines, residents said.  Reuters talked to two Rakhine Buddhist officials who corroborated the scale of the damage.  Tin Tun Soe, a Rakhine administrator in Chein Khar Li, where a security post had come under attack, said the army response was rapid and all the Rohingya had been driven out. Nearly 1,600 houses were burned down a day after the attacks, he said, though he blamed the fires on the insurgents.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They have so many people. If they are here, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re afraid to live,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Tin Tun Soe. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am very happy that now all of them are gone.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Reporting by Wa Lone and Shoon Naing in Yangon; Additional reporting by Simon Lewis in Cox's Bazar; Writing by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Alex Richardson",en,terrorattack,,

The leader of one of the militias, which are known as Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), denied the accusation and said their fighters were strictly following the law in their dealings with civilians fleeing military operations in the area.  Iraq launched an offensive on September 21 to dislodge Islamic State from Hawija, which lies west of the oil city of Kirkuk and is one of two areas of the country still under the control of the militants.  Men from villages near Hawija were detained by militias from the Badr Organisation, a pro-Iran, ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite grouping that is playing a major role in BaghdadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war against Islamic State, and were taken to an unknown location, the HRW report said, based on interviews with villagers evacuated to a nearby refugee camp.  The villagers told HRW they had seen militia fighters using their gun butts to beat the detained men. During their detention the fighters brought them food only once and only a small amount of water but did not let them use a bathroom.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Human Rights Watch has documented that PMF groups, including units affiliated with the Badr Organization, have screened, detained, and tortured people during the military operations,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the report.Women were also detained briefly by Iraqi security forces and were questioned about their male relativesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ activities before being transported to the refugee camp, HRW said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“While Iraqi forces do need all the help they can get, the government should not allow abusive forces to use this opportunity for even more abuse,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.  The Iraqi government was not immediately available to comment on the HRW report, but local Badr commander Kareem al-Mohammedawi denied that villagersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rights had been abused.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are strictly ordering our fighters to abide by the law and avoid mistreating refugees fleeing the fighting. But when we suspect someone is a terrorist we normally arrest him and hand him over to the security forces,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Hawija and a stretch of land along the Syrian border are the last pieces of Iraq still in the hands of Islamic State, which overran about a third of the country in 2014.

Hundreds of militants are believed to have escaped from Sirte before or during the seven-month campaign to oust the jihadist group from the coastal city, which it took control of in 2015.  Sheltering in desert camps, fugitive militants have become emboldened in recent weeks, occasionally setting up checkpoints on roads to the south and east of Sirte and claiming two deadly attacks against local forces.  The United States, which provided air support for the Sirte campaign, has conducted three sets of air strikes targeting the camps - one in January, one on Sept. 22, and one on Tuesday.  After the first strikes some wounded militants had been arrested and some ""materials"" seized, Sadiq Al-Sour, head of investigations for the Attorney General's office, said at a news conference in Tripoli.  Investigators learned that Islamic State had established a ""desert army"" led by Libyan militant Al-Mahdi Salem Dangou, also known as Abu Barakat, Sour said. The force includes three brigades operating under Dangou, each with its own commander.  ""This army was established after the liberation of the city of Sirte... Now they are in the Libyan desert,"" said Sour.  Separately, Sour said authorities had arrested a senior Islamic State commander who supervised the beheading of 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt in Sirte in February 2015.  ""He gave details on the incident and indicated their place of burial,"" Sour said. ""We are seeking with military authorities in the central region to discover where the bodies are, and hopefully we will find them, despite the time that has passed.""  Egypt launched air strikes in Libya a day after Islamic State released a video showing the Copts being beheaded on a beach.  Sour said that in the past, Islamic State had used established routes to bring foreign fighters into Libya from neighboring countries including Sudan, Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria.  The largest number of fighters had been brought in from Sudan and transited through the Libyan city of Ajdabiya, about 350 km (218 miles) east of Sirte, he said.

BEIRUT: The Islamic State group released a recording Thursday of what it says is its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, calling on jihadists under pressure in Syria and Iraq to Ã¢â‚¬Å“resistÃ¢â‚¬Â their enemies.  In his first alleged message in nearly a year and following reports of his possible death, the elusive jihadist leader called on his supporters to target the Ã¢â‚¬Å“media centresÃ¢â‚¬Â of countries fighting his group.  The United States said it was verifying the recording, but also that it had Ã¢â‚¬Å“no reason to doubtÃ¢â‚¬Â its authenticity.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The leaders of the Islamic State and its soldiers have realised that the path toÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ victory is to be patient and resist the infidels whatever their alliances,Ã¢â‚¬Â Baghdadi allegedly said in the recording.  It was not clear when the message, released by the IS-affiliated Al-Furqan media group, was recorded.  In it, he lashed out at Ã¢â‚¬Å“infidel nations headed by America, Russia and IranÃ¢â‚¬Â who, along with their allies, have inflicted losses on the jihadists during separate offensives against IS in Syria and Iraq.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will remain, we will resist and be patientÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ We will not give in,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, a day after Iraqi forces defeated IS fighters who had seized areas in a surprise offensive around Ramadi west of Baghdad.  The apparent IS leader called on Ã¢â‚¬Å“soldiers of the caliphateÃ¢â‚¬Â to pursue their Ã¢â‚¬Å“jihadÃ¢â‚¬Â, or holy war, and attacks.  He urged his followers to Ã¢â‚¬Å“target the media centres of the infidelsÃ¢â‚¬Â, without providing further details.  No verification yet  The voice said to belong to Baghdadi listed his groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defeats, referring to Ã¢â‚¬Å“blood spilt in Mosul, Ramadi, Sirte, Raqa and HamaÃ¢â‚¬Â.  IS lost Ramadi in February 2016, LibyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sirte in December last year, and IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second city Mosul in July.  In Syria, the group is facing ongoing offensives in its former de facto Syrian capital of Raqa and in the central province of Hama.  A US intelligence community source said they were examining the audio message.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are aware of the audio tape purported to be of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and are taking steps to examine it,Ã¢â‚¬Â the source said in a statement.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“While we have no reason to doubt its authenticity, we do not have verification at this point.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told AFP: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have no information about this recording.Ã¢â‚¬Â  ThursdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s was the first audio message said to be of Baghdadi since November 2016, when he spoke in a defiant tone in urging his supporters to defend the city of Mosul against a massive operation by Iraqi forces.  That recording, also released by Al-Furqan, was a rare sign of life from Baghdadi.  In July, Moscow said it was struggling to confirm if Baghdadi was dead or alive, a month after reporting his possible demise in a May air strike near the IS one-time stronghold of Raqa in Syria.  With a $25 million US bounty on his head, Iraq-born Baghdadi has successfully avoided an intense effort to seek him out for six years or more.  Rumours have abounded about BaghdadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health and movements, but his whereabouts have largely remained unclear.  Still alive?  On September 1, a senior US general said Baghdadi was probably still alive and likely hiding in the Euphrates River valley stretching from Syria to Iraq.  A US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and Russian-backed government forces are waging rival offensives against IS territory on either side of the Euphrates River in SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Deir Ezzor province.  In Iraq, US-backed Iraqi forces are pressing their battle to retake the northern city of Hawija and a section of the Euphrates near the border with Syria.  Shortly after the jihadists swept across swathes of Iraq in June 2014, Baghdadi appeared before thousands of faithful at MosulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Great mosque of Al-Nuri to urge Muslims around the world to join his Ã¢â‚¬Å“caliphateÃ¢â‚¬Â straddling Syria and Iraq.  The jihadists have since lost vast territory in both countries.  But US counterterrorism chief Nick Rasmussen warned on Wednesday the global threat posed by IS had not been diminished by its battlefield defeats in Iraq and Syria.  He said, using an alternative acronym for IS, there was Ã¢â‚¬Å“not, in fact, a direct link between ISISÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ battlefield position in Iraq and Syria and the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capacity to inspire external attacks.Ã¢â‚¬Â  BaghdadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s group has claimed its members were behind deadly attacks carried out worldwide, including in Paris, London and Barcelona.  WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operation near the Iraqi city of Ramadi was likely to have been an attempt to divert the security forces from an offensive they launched last week against the jihadistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ last two footholds in Iraq.",en,terrorattack,,
779439,todayonline,None,Islamic State releases recording said to be of its leader,http://www.todayonline.com/world/middle-east/islamic-state-releases-recording-said-be-its-leader,,29/9/2017 17:34,"WASHINGTON/CAIRO Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Islamic State (IS) has issued what appears to be the first recording in nearly a year of its reclusive leader, Abu Bakr Baghdadi, a move that seems intended to silence rumors of his death and to galvanize his pummeled troops.  The 46-minute audio recording on Thursday would be the first time since November that supporters of the jihadi group have heard the voice of their self-proclaimed caliph. Since then, the group has lost significant territory, including Mosul, Iraq, which had been the largest city under its control, and much of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capital, Raqqa, Syria.  In the recording, Baghdadi praised his foot soldiers for waging a tenacious battle in Mosul.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They fulfilled their promise and their responsibility, and they did not give up except over their skulls and body parts,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thus they were excused, after nearly a year of fighting and confrontation.Ã¢â‚¬Â  He also accused the United States-backed troops they faced of using scorched-earth tactics. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They burned the people, trees, and everything on the ground,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group.  But instead of pondering those losses, Baghdadi, 46, emphasised the threat the West still faces from IS, making indirect references to recent attacks on the Underground in London, in the heart of Barcelona and in Russia.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now the Americans, the Russians and the Europeans are living in terror in their countries, fearing the strikes of the mujahedeen,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  The recording, which was widely disseminated to IS supporters in their chat rooms on the messaging app Telegram, begins with the voice of a narrator who introduces Baghdadi and adds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“May Allah protect him.Ã¢â‚¬Â  That phrase is used to refer to people who are still living and is intended to signal that Baghdadi is not dead, contrary to reports over the summer. The recording also cites current events, including the growing nuclear threat from North Korea, suggesting that it was recorded in recent weeks.  In June, the Russian military said it might have killed Baghdadi in a strike on IS leaders in May near Raqqa. In July, a British-based monitoring organisation, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said senior IS commanders had confirmed that Baghdadi had been killed in Deir el-Zour province.  Neither report could be independently confirmed, and US officials immediately cast doubt on their credibility.  Despite the doubts, rumors of BaghdadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death continued to swirl. More important than the content of the audio is the fact that it served as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“proof-of-life message,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mr Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Program on Extremism.  The IS has been steadily losing territory since 2015.  This year, it lost the city of Mosul, where it controlled a population of about 1 million people; the nearby town of Tal Afar, Iraq; and part of Raqqa.  Despite these setbacks, the group continues to be a fierce and nimble foe. The battle for Mosul, which President Barack ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s administration had hoped to conclude before he left office in January, grew into a bloody nine-month slog, with entire neighborhoods obliterated in an effort to kill the remaining fighters. It came at a steep price to IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military, which lost more than 700 troops in the battle.  Even as the group has lost territory in one part of its caliphate, it has retaken areas that were declared liberated and pushed into new parts of the world.  In recent weeks, new IS checkpoints have emerged in Libya, and the group continues to hold parts of the city of Marawi, in the Philippines, despite a four-month-long siege by the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military.  The IS staged a counter-assault this week on Ramadi, Iraq, a town liberated by the Iraqis in 2015. In neighbouring Syria on Thursday, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fighters assaulted a position south of the city of Deir el-Zour, putting a dent in recent gains by the government.  The group has also continued to remotely guide and inspire its sympathisers to carry out both small-scale and devastating attacks in Europe, with cells of people who had never traveled to Syria behind some of the worst violence, including in Britain and Spain.  Sounding a defiant tone, Baghdadi ridiculed the coalition forces who are battling the group with US help, saying they Ã¢â‚¬Å“wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand one hour of fighting without Crusader air support.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Baghdadi ended his speech by vowing to continue fighting, including calling for attacks on Ã¢â‚¬Å“disbeliever media centres.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Although the recordingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authenticity could not be immediately confirmed, the voice on the tape sounds the same as that of other recordings of Baghdadi. The IS has not misrepresented a recording of its leader in the past, and the Pentagon said it had Ã¢â‚¬Å“no reason to believe tape is not authentic.Ã¢â‚¬Â THE NEW YORK TIMES",en,terrorattack,122,"['State', 'State']"

The 46-minute audio recording would be the first time since last November that supporters of the militant group have heard the voice of their self-proclaimed caliph. Since then, the group has lost significant territory, including Mosul in Iraq, which had been the largest city under its control, and much of the group's capital, Raqqa in Syria.  In the recording, Baghdadi, instead of pondering those losses, emphasised the threat the West still faces from ISIS, making indirect references to recent attacks on the Underground in London, in the heart of Barcelona and in Russia. ""Now, the Americans, the Russians and the Europeans are living in terror in their countries, fearing the strikes of the mujahideen,"" he said.  Peppered with references to current geopolitical flashpoints, including North Korea and Iraqi Kurdistan, the unverified 46-minute speech seemed partly intended to silence reports that Baghdadi had been killed on the battlefield.  In June, the Russian military said it might have killed him in a strike in May near Raqqa. In July, a British-based monitoring organisation, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said senior ISIS commanders had confirmed that he had been killed in Deir el-Zour province. Neither report could be independently confirmed, and US officials cast doubt on their credibility.  More important than the content of the audio is the fact that it served as a ""proof-of-life message"", said Mr Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's Programme on Extremism.  ISIS has been steadily losing territory since 2015. This year, it lost the city of Mosul, the nearby town of Tal Afar and part of Raqqa. Despite these setbacks, the group continues to be a fierce and nimble foe.  It staged a counter-assault this week on Ramadi, an Iraqi town liberated by the Iraqis in 2015. In neighbouring Syria on Thursday, ISIS fighters assaulted a position south of the city of Deir el-Zour, putting a dent in recent gains by the government.  Even as the group has lost territory in one part of its caliphate, it has pushed into new parts of the world. In recent weeks, new ISIS checkpoints have emerged in Libya, and the group continues to hold parts of the Philippine city of Marawi, despite a four-month-long siege by the country's military. ISIS has also continued to remotely guide and inspire its sympathisers to carry out both small-scale and devastating attacks in Europe, with cells of people who had never been to Syria behind some of the worst violence, including in Britain and Spain.  Sounding defiant, Baghdadi ended his speech by vowing to continue fighting, including urging attacks on ""disbeliever media centres"".  Although the recording's authenticity could not be immediately confirmed, ISIS has not misrepresented a recording of its leader in the past, and the Pentagon said it had ""no reason to believe the tape is not authentic"".

In July, as Lawan and his fellow militiamen provided cover for oil exploration workers, Boko Haram fighters launched an attack against them near Maiduguri, located in the country's northeast.    ""It was an ambush,"" he told Al Jazeera, explaining that they were caught off guard due to the calmness of the area.

""The attack happened on our last day.""  READ MORE: More than half of Borno schools closed over Boko Haram  When the dust settled, more than 50 people had been killed. It was the deadliest Boko Haram attack so far in 2017 and came at a time of increased suicide bombings and abductions in the region.  In response, the Nigerian army deployed additional personnel and equipment, where locals say a climate of fear now prevails.  The Nigerian military declined requests for comment on the ongoing offensive against Boko Haram.  In early September, Amnesty International published a report that said Boko Haram was responsible for at least 400 deaths since April.  'No end in sight'  Boko Haram was established in 2009, and the group boasts of several thousand fighters. Throughout the last year, fighting between the armed organisation and the Nigerian military has left at least 20,000 people dead and more than 2.6 million displaced in northeastern Nigeria.  Last month, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said that fighting between the government and Boko Haram resulted in the closure of more than half of all the schools in the country's northeastern state of Borne.  The report found that an estimated three million children are in emergency need of education. It added that nearly 100 children have also been used as ""human bombs"" since the beginning of the year.

Sadeeq Garba Shehu, a retired army captain and security expert, explained that Boko Haram's recent loss of territory to the Nigerian army has led to the group striking back with more suicide bombings and kidnappings.  ""Holding ground also makes you weaker because Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ it means the opposing force has something to hit,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""But when you attack and run, you kind of dilute all the advantages in numbers, in equipment, in training.""  The Nigerian military, which has increased its counterinsurgency campaigns in the last two years, has claimed that Boko Haram is weakened and near defeat.  Yet, Shehu fears there is no end in sight.

Two women were stabbed to death and their assailant shot dead by a soldier in the southern French port city of Marseille on Sunday in what officials described as a ""likely terrorist act"".  MARSEILLE, France/PARIS: Two women were stabbed to death and their assailant shot dead by a soldier in the southern French port city of Marseille on Sunday in what officials described as a ""likely terrorist act"".  Police sources said the suspect had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) in Arabic as he attacked the women, aged 17 and 20, at Marseille's main railway station.  Two police sources said one had her throat slit while the other was stabbed in the chest and stomach.  The assailant was shot dead by a soldier from a military Sentinelle patrol, a force deployed across the country as part of a state of emergency declared after Islamist attacks that began almost two years ago.  ""We have until now managed to avoid such dramatic incidents (in Marseille). I think it was a terrorist attack and the individual who was killed seems to have had several identities,"" Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin told reporters.  Paris was rocked in 2015 by multiple attacks that killed 130 people. In 2016 a gunman drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86 people. Both of these attacks were claimed by Islamic State.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Other countries, including Britain, Germany and Belgium, have also suffered attacks by militants using knives, guns, explosives and driving vehicles at crowds.  Some 200 police officers cordoned off the area and all roads were closed to traffic.  A witness told Reuters she saw a man take out a knife from his sleeve and then stab a young girl and then a second woman, shouting what could have been ""Allahu Akbar"".  ""BARBARIC ACT""  Speaking in Marseille, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the man had initially killed one woman and looked to be running away before returning to attack a second woman and then rush towards soldiers from the Sentinelle force who arrived on the scene quickly and shot him dead.  Two police sources said the attacker had been carrying a butcher's knife, was around 30 years old and of North African appearance. One source said he was known to police for common law crimes, while another said digital analysis of fingerprints had come up with several aliases.  ""This could be an act of terrorism, but we cannot confirm it fully at this stage,"" Collomb told reporters.  French troops are part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa fighting al Qaeda-linked militants, operations that have made these groups urge their followers to target France.  Security forces have increasingly been targeted by militants in knife attacks. A man wielding a knife attacked a soldier in a Paris metro station on Sept. 15.  President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter he was ""disgusted by this barbaric act"" and praised the calmness and efficiency of security forces.  French lawmakers are due to vote on a much-criticised anti-terrorism law on Tuesday, which would see France come out of its state-of-emergency in November, although some of the powers would be enshrined into law.  The number of military personnel on the ground is also due to be reduced slightly, although the force is being adapted to make it more mobile and its movements less predictable.  ""The presence of Sentinelle soldiers, their speed and efficiency ensured that the death count was not bigger,"" police union official Stephane Battaglia told Reuters.

He is the author of "" United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists .""  (CNN) Americans often think of themselves as belonging to an exceptional nation, and in many ways they do. They belong to a tolerant, multicultural society that has led the world toward a more innovative and more inclusive future through new technologies and a unique embrace of diverse cultures.  But the United States also leads the world in other ways that don't match the often complacent self-conception that many Americans have of their own country. The United States locks up more of its population proportionally than any other country in the world, including authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies. It also leads in another dubious statistic: More Americans are killed by fellow citizens armed with guns than in any other advanced country, according to the Small Arms Survey.  In 2011 alone, according to FBI statistics, more than 11,000 Americans were killed by firearms in the United States (a figure that excludes suicides).  Despite all the reasonable concerns in the United States about jihadist terrorism, in any given year Americans are almost 2,000 times more likely to be killed by a fellow American armed with a gun than by a jihadist terrorist. Since the 9/11 attacks, 95 Americans have been killed by jihadist terrorists, on average about six Americans a year, according to data collected by New America.  By contrast, in the United Kingdom, a country which is similar to the United States in terms of its laws and culture, Britain suffers around 50-60 gun deaths a year in a country where the population is around a fifth the size of the United States. In other words, you are about 40 times more likely to be killed by an assailant with a gun in the United States than you are in the United Kingdom.  To be sure there are occasional mass-casualty attacks in Europe by murderers armed with guns, such as the assaults by the neo-Nazi Anders Breivik who killed 77 in Norway in 2011 and the attack in Dunblane, Scotland at a school where 16 children were killed in 1996, but these are exceptions to the rule.  We still don't know the motivations of Stephen Paddock, who on Sunday night carried out the worst mass shooting in modern American history, killing at least 58 and injuring more than 500, but what we do know, so far, is that he had at least 10 rifles in the room from which he launched his rampage.  Paddock also hailed from Nevada, a state that allows "" open carry ,"" which enables its residents to openly display weapons in public. Which other civilized country allows its citizens to show up, say, at a Starbucks carrying semi-automatic guns?  The Second Amendment, of course, is the Second Amendment, so certainly American laws allow the possession of weapons by its citizens. But it's unlikely that the Founders' intention was to let troubled American citizens acquire arsenals to kill as many as their fellow citizens as possible.  With each new outrage -- from the Sandy Hook massacre to the attack on the gay nightclub in Orlando -- there follows a certain amount of soul-searching by the American public and policy makers about the distinctive American gun culture that has developed in recent years, where pretty much anyone can acquire an arsenal of weapons. But each time the moment of self-reflection seems to pass.  Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook  This is a tribute to the political muscle of the National Rifle Association which embraces a Second Amendment absolutism that allows even the dangerous number of less than 1,000 Americans who are on the ""no fly"" list to legally purchase semi-automatic weapons.  One can only hope that the tragic events in Las Vegas may change this. However, given that previous tragedies have not changed this deadly equation, there is really little reason for hope.  That resigns us to a dystopian future where Americans attending something as innocuous as an office holiday party in San Bernardino in 2015, or partying at a nightclub in Orlando the following year, or attending a country music concert on Sunday in Las Vegas have to live with the lethal reality that they may become the innocent targets of their well-armed fellow citizens.

LAS VEGAS: A retiree armed with multiple assault rifles strafed an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas from a high-rise hotel window on Sunday, slaughtering at least 59 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history before killing himself.  The barrage of gunfire from the 32nd-floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel into a crowd of 22,000 people came in extended bursts that lasted several minutes, sparking panic as throngs of music fans desperately cowered on the open ground, hemmed in by fellow concertgoers, while others at the edge tried to flee.  More than 525 people were injured - some by gunfire or shrapnel, some trampled - in the pandemonium adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip as police scrambled to locate the assailant.  Police identified the gunman as Stephen Paddock, 64, who lived in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada. They said they believed he acted alone and did not know why he attacked the crowd.  The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the massacre, but U.S. officials said there was no evidence of that.  At least a dozen people were in critical condition at University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where all of the injured were taken, a spokeswoman said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The preliminary death toll, which officials said could rise, surpassed last year's massacre of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by a gunman who pledged allegiance to Islamic State.  The dead in Las Vegas included a nurse, a government employee and an off-duty police officer.  Shocked survivors, some with blood on their clothing, wandered streets, where the flashing lights of the city's gaudy casinos blended with those of emergency vehicles.  Police said Paddock had no criminal record. The gunman killed himself before police entered the hotel room from where he was firing, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters.  ""We have no idea what his belief system was,"" Lombardo said. ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath.""  Federal officials said there was no evidence to link Paddock to militant organizations.  ""We have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group,"" Aaron Rouse, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field office in Las Vegas, told reporters.  U.S. officials discounted the claim of responsibility for the attack made by Islamic State.  ""We advise caution on jumping to conclusions before the facts are in,"" CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in an email.  MULTIPLE GUNS  Lombardo said there were 16 firearms in the room where Paddock killed himself, some with scopes and some that appeared to have been modified to convert them to fully automatic weapons.  Lombardo said the gunman apparently used a ""device similar to a hammer"" to smash the windows from which he fired.  Police found at least 18 additional firearms, some explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition at Paddock's home in Mesquite, about 90 miles (145 km) northeast of Las Vegas, along with ""some electronic devices that we are evaluating at this time,"" Lombardo told reporters.  Chris Sullivan, the owner of the Guns & Guitars gun shop in Mesquite, issued a statement confirming that Paddock was a customer who cleared ""all necessary background checks and procedures.""  ""He never gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time,"" Sullivan said, adding that his business was cooperating with investigators. He did not say how many or the kinds of weapons Paddock purchased there.  The shooting, the latest in a string that have played out across the United States over recent years, sparked a renewed outcry from some lawmakers about the pervasiveness of guns in the United States, but was unlikely to prompt action in Congress.  Efforts to pass tougher federal gun laws failed following a number of mass shootings, including the 2012 massacre of 26 young children and educators in Newtown, Connecticut, and the June attack on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game.  Nevada has some of the nation's most permissive gun laws. It does not require firearm owners to obtain licenses or register their guns.  House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, on Monday called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to create a select committee on gun violence.  ""Congress has a moral duty to address this horrific and heartbreaking epidemic,"" Pelosi wrote.  The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and gun-rights advocates staunchly defend it. U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has been outspoken in his support for the Second Amendment.  The White House said on Monday that it was too soon after the attack to consider gun control policies.  ""Today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost,"" presidential spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said at a news briefing. ""It would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don't fully know all the facts or what took place last night.""  Trump said he would travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with victims, relatives and first responders.  ""It was an act of pure evil,"" said Trump, who later led a moment of silence at the White House in honour of the victims.  The suspected shooter's brother, Eric Paddock, said the family was stunned by the news.  ""We're horrified. We're bewildered, and our condolences go out to the victims,"" Eric Paddock said in a telephone interview, his voice trembling. ""We have no idea in the world.""  He said his brother belonged to no political or religious organizations, and had no history of mental illness. Their father had been a bank robber who for a time was listed on the FBI's ""Ten Most Wanted"" list of fugitives.  Speaking to reporters from his doorstep in Orlando, Florida, he described his brother as ""a wealthy guy"" who liked to play video poker and take cruises. He seemed to have been settling into a quiet life when he moved back to Nevada from Florida.  'JUST KEPT GOING ON'  Video of the attack showed terrified crowds fleeing under rapid gunfire as the shooter took aim from a distance of around 1,050 feet (320 m).  ""People were just dropping to the ground. It just kept going on,"" said Steve Smith, a 45-year-old visitor from Phoenix, Arizona.  ""Probably 100 shots at a time,"" Smith said.  Las Vegas's casinos, nightclubs and shopping draw some 3.5 million visitors from around the world each year and the area was packed with visitors when the shooting started shortly after 10 p.m. local time (0400 GMT).  Mike McGarry, a financial adviser from Philadelphia, was at the concert when he heard hundreds of shots.  ""It was crazy - I laid on top of the kids. They're 20. I'm 53. I lived a good life,"" McGarry said.  The back of his shirt bore footmarks from people who ran over him in panic.

It dawned on people when they heard screams, when they saw bloodied victims collapse around them, or when others stampeded for the exits, trampling some of the people in their way.  Many of the terrified people followed their instincts and crouched or lay flat, not realising that they remained exposed to a gunman lodged high above them, while others surged into surrounding streets and buildings, leaving behind a litter of drink cups, cellphones, bags and shoes lost in the panic.  By sunrise Monday (Oct 2), the staggering toll at an outdoor country music festival on a cool desert night was becoming clear: at least 59 people died, police said, and 527 were injured, either by gunfire or in the flight to safety.  A lone gunman perched on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, had smashed the windows of his hotel suite with a hammer, taken aim at a crowd that the police said numbered 22,000 people, and committed one of the deadliest mass shootings in US history.  At least 20 rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were found in the suite, a law enforcement official said. Among the guns were AR-15-style assault rifles, another official said.  The gunman had two rifles, outfitted with scopes, set up on tripods in front of two big windows, said the first official. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to divulge details of the investigation.  Authorities did not immediately say what model of weapon or weapons the gunman fired, but on videos posted online by witnesses, the rapid-fire sound indicated that it was fully automatic, like a machine gun.  Among the revellers below at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, Melissa Ayala, 41, said she first realised what was happening when a man near her fell to the ground, blood spurting from his neck.  ""It seemed like rapid fire,"" she said. ""There was blood pouring everywhere.""  She said she and four friends, who had come to the festival from California, were drinking and laughing when they heard the gunfire, which at first they thought was fireworks.  ""It was just total chaos,"" she said. ""People falling down and laying everywhere. We were trying to take cover and we had no idea where to go.""  Her friend, Shami Espinoza, 38, wiped away tears and said it seemed their only choices were ""either run and get shot and die, or stay and get shot and die.""  Police identified the gunman as Stephen Paddock, 64, a retiree with no significant criminal history, who liked to gamble and seemed to live a quiet life with his girlfriend in Mesquite, Nevada. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said SWAT units swarmed into the hotel, starting on the 29th floor, going floor by floor and room by room, before finding the gunman in his room.  ""We believe the individual killed himself prior to our entry,"" the sheriff said.  Paddock was in a suite, number 32135, a hotel employee said, giving him sweeping views to the east and north.  Eric Paddock, a brother of Stephen Paddock who lives in Orlando, Florida, told CBS News that his brother was ""not an avid gun guy at all,"" adding, ""if he had have killed my kids, I couldn't be more dumbfounded.""  ""The fact that he had those kind of weapons is just * where the hell did he get automatic weapons?"" Eric Paddock asked.  ""He has no military background or anything like that,"" he added. ""He's a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite and drove down and gambled in Las Vegas.""  He said Stephen Paddock had recently texted him to ask how their mother was faring after Hurricane Irma.  The Islamic State terrorist group, through its news agency, Amaq, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam months earlier, and had ""responded to calls for targeting coalition countries"" that are fighting the group in Syria and Iraq. That phrasing usually indicates that the attacker was inspired by the group, rather than directed by it, but such claims have not always proved accurate in the past.  Aaron Rouse, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Las Vegas, said, ""We have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group.""  The first reports of the shooting came at 10.08pm local time. Officers were overheard on police radio channels reporting that they were pinned down by gunfire. Shortly before midnight, Las Vegas police reported that ""one suspect is down,"" and soon after, police said they did not believe there were any more active gunmen.  Speaking at the White House, President Donald Trump called the shooting ""an act of pure evil,"" ordered flags flown at half-staff, and said he would travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday.  ""The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are working closely with local authorities to assist in the investigation,"" Mr Trump said, and he praised the performance of the Las Vegas police. ""The speed with which they reacted was miraculous and prevented further loss of life.""  Video of the shooting captured nine seconds of rapid-fire, continuous bursts of fire, followed by 37 seconds of silence from the weapon and panicked screaming from the crowd. When the shooting began, country music artist Jason Aldean continued singing ""When She Says Baby"" for a few seconds before realizing what was happening and taking cover.  Gunfire then erupted again in at least two more bursts, both shorter than the first.  In the confusion after the shooting, police also descended on the Ali Baba Restaurant, about a 10-minute drive from the Mandalay Bay, and they also investigated reports of a shooting at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino, not far from the concert ground.  Jake Owen, a country singer who was on stage with Aldean when the shooting began, told CNN on Monday that it was like ""shooting fish in a barrel from where he was.""  ""This is not an exaggeration: This shooting was going on for at least 10 minutes,"" he added. ""It was nonstop.""  Concertgoers described hearing round after round of gunfire. ""Everyone was running, you could see people getting shot,"" Gail Davis, one of the witnesses, said. ""I've never been that scared in my life,"" she added. ""To have this happen, I can't wrap my mind around it.""  University Medical Center, which has Nevada's only level 1 trauma centre, took in 104 patients, arriving by ambulance and private cars, including four who died, and 12 who were in critical condition Monday morning. ""We had our first rush and it was nonstop,"" said Danita Cohen, a hospital administrator.  Ordinarily, the trauma centre would take in eight to 10 traffic accident victims in a night. But the trauma teams regularly train for mass casualty events; the most recent session was led by an emergency responder from the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.  Dignity Health-St Rose Dominican Hospital received 56 patients at its three campuses, including four who were in critical condition. Most had suffered gunshots, but others had been trampled while fleeing, or had been hurt climbing fences to escape the shooting.  ""No one has experienced patient volumes to this level,"" said Jennifer Cooper, a hospital spokeswoman.  As survivors poured into streets and buildings surrounding the concert site, and police and paramedics streamed into the scene, unsure how many gunmen there were, the massacre shut down roads and highways; police reported closing off about a mile of Las Vegas Boulevard and asked the public to steer clear of the area. Hours later, much of the city remained shut down.  McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, just east of the Mandalay, said that some flights destined for the airport were diverted because of police activity, and some of the people fleeing the scene ran to the airport, disrupting operations there. Some survivors reported trying to climb the chain-link, barbed wire-topped security fence around the airport, until firefighters ripped the fence up from the ground, allowing them to crawl under it.  Krystal Legette, who was visiting from New York, and several other people were at the Sundance Helicopters office at the airport, waiting for a sightseeing flight around the city, when she said three women burst into the building, screaming, ""They're shooting, they're shooting."" Then another woman came in, bleeding from a bullet wound in her right arm, and Legette, a nurse, and three others applied a tourniquet.  More and more people ran into the office, until about 100 people had taken shelter there, she said. A company worker turned out the lights, locked the doors and told everyone to go inside closets and other areas away from the windows.  The hotel itself was placed on virtual lockdown after the shooting, guests said.  ""We went into the hotel and they started shutting down casinos,"" Todd Price, a guest of Mandalay Bay, told CNN. ""We tried to get into our rooms, and they shut down the elevators and started to get everybody out.""  The Route 91 Harvest Festival bills itself as ""three days of country music on the Vegas Strip,"" and Sunday night's performance was the last of the festival. The site of the concert, the Las Vegas Village and Festival Grounds, run by MGM Resorts, sprawls over 15 acres and has a capacity of 40,000 people. The festival's website said this year's three-day concert was sold out.  In the first hours after the shooting, police searched for a woman described as ""a companion"" of the gunman, Marilou Danley. Later, the sheriff said she had been located out of the country, and apparently was not with Paddock when he checked into the hotel, but that ""he was utilizing some of her identification.""  Eric Paddock identified Danley as his brother's girlfriend. ""We were worried that he might have hurt her, too,"" he said. THE NEW YORK TIMES",en,terrorattack,132,"['Las', 'US']"

A secessionist leader seeking independence from Nigeria has been missing since an alleged military raid more than two weeks ago left his house in the city of Umuahia riddled with bullet holes, its windows smashed and doors hanging off hinges.  UMUAHIA, Nigeria: A secessionist leader seeking independence from Nigeria has been missing since an alleged military raid more than two weeks ago left his house in the city of Umuahia riddled with bullet holes, its windows smashed and doors hanging off hinges.  The disappearance of Nnamdi Kanu, after the raid the army says did not happen, threatens to ignite separatist unrest capable of destabilising southeastern Nigeria, a region where a million people died in a 1967-70 civil war over the short-lived Republic of Biafra.  Kingsley Kanu, 48, said he was with his older brother Nnamdi, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, at their family home on the evening of Sept. 14 when soldiers stormed in.  ""They were shooting everything they saw,"" he said, pointing to bullet holes in walls and windows.  ""They came here just to kill everybody,"" he said, adding that around 20 IPOB members were shot dead but most of the bodies were taken by soldiers.  Reuters witnesses - a reporter and TV cameraman - on Sept. 27 saw six corpses with bullet wounds in a morgue, who IPOB said were among their members.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Two resembled men in photographs held by weeping relatives who told Reuters their brothers were killed in the raid, though nobody could verify the identities of the four others.  ""The military did not raid Nnamdi Kanu's residence,"" a military spokesman told reporters in the capital, Abuja. ""Nnamdi Kanu is not in the custody of the military.""  The allegation and denial are the biggest flashpoint of a military deployment in the southeast that began in September.  Civil society groups and analysts say the military presence, last month's designation of IPOB as a ""terrorist organisation"", and its leader's disappearance could prompt the separatists to abandon their policy of non-violence.  President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim northerner, made a crackdown on secessionists the focus of his first speech in August after returning from three months of medical leave in Britain.  He then held talks with armed forces chiefs who days later launched Operation Python Dance, which the military said was intended to reduce violent crime and ""secessionist agitations"".  Soldiers with rifles are present across Umuahia, capital of Abia state, in armoured vans and at checkpoints where motorists are routinely questioned.  Buhari is already contending with Boko Haram's jihadist insurgency in the northeast and seeking to maintain a ceasefire with militants in the southern oil-producing Niger Delta.  But some say the former military ruler risks exacerbating the situation, just as militant attacks in the Niger Delta surged last year after troops were deployed.  HEAVY-HANDED?  ""The government's heavy-handed approach will only shore up local support for a radical group that previously struggled to broaden its base,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt of global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.  Ryan Cummings, director of Africa-focused risk management company Signal Risk, said the Igbo ethnic group that dominates the region, and has long spoken of being marginalised, felt targeted.  ""The government has allowed insecurity to burgeon in other areas of Nigeria without similar deployments,"" he said, citing attacks by Fulani herdsmen that have killed hundreds of people in central Nigeria over the last few years.  Tension followed the arrival of troops in the southeast.  Abia's governor imposed a curfew in the city of Aba last month. Several days of tension between IPOB members and troops led to claims by the group that Kanu's house had been besieged by soldiers, which the military denied.  Videos circulating on social media including footage purportedly showing troops in Abia using sticks to flog men stripped to the waist, which the army said it was investigating, have heightened anger.  ""The presence of the army scared our people. People spoke about what happened during the Biafran war,"" said Onyebuchi Ememanka, a special adviser to the state's governor who is a member of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP).  ""There were no serious security challenges that would justify the deployment of troops,"" said Ememanka.  He said he never saw IPOB's members carrying weapons, though he added that a uniformed national guard and secret service had held parades in the last few weeks, which he called a ""new dimension"".  Red, black and green paint - the Biafran flag's colours - daubed on walls and tree trunks across Umuahia follow calls for a referendum on independence.  Kanu's release on bail in April, after being held for nearly two years on charges of criminal conspiracy and treasonable offences, brought attention back to the issue.  However, talk of secession among people on the streets of Umuahia mostly hinged on whether or not they had the right to make a democratic choice about their future rather than aligning with IPOB's belief in a need for a separate state.  Opinions tend to be divided along generation lines, with younger people born long after the war expressing an interest in a referendum while older people who remember the war or grew up hearing stories about the conflict are often wary of even discussing the subject.  However, a pronouncement earlier this year by activists in the northern state of Kaduna that Igbos, who are mainly Christian, should be evicted stirred ethnic tensions. The dispute acted as a lightning rod for frustrations against Buhari, who fought in the civil war on the government side as a young soldier.  A lack of development in the southeast for decades has cemented a belief among Igbos that they have been marginalised.  IPOB ARRESTS  Michael Ogbizi, Abia state police commissioner, said 74 IPOB members had been arrested since Sept. 12 and charged with offences including murder and arson.  Many charges related to the burning down of a police station in mid-September in Aba where nine people died. Ogbizi said police had no records of IPOB members being killed.  An IPOB spokesman denied the group was involved in the fire.  Amid differing opinions about the group's past conduct, Kanu's disappearance has created uncertainty about its future.  ""If they have killed him, let them give us the corpse,"" said the IPOB leader's brother, adding that his missing 82-year-old father and 67-year-old mother should be released if they are being held.  Liewerscheidt said if Kanu were to die at the hands of the authorities parallels could be drawn with the origins of the Boko Haram insurgency that began after the death of Mohammed Yusuf, the Islamist militant group's founder, in police custody.  ""This would likely transform IPOB into precisely the terrorist organisation the military claims it already is,"" he said.

827534,aljazeera,Linah Alsaafin,Palestine 2015 attacks triggered new path of resistance,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/years-palestine-2015-resistance-continues-171001142310665.html,,4/10/2017 15:42,"Two years since the spark of October 2015 uprising, young Palestinians set new path of fighting the Israeli oppression.  Just before noon on a warm October day, a shopkeeper in the Old City of Jerusalem was thinking about the young man who moments ago had asked him for a lighter, despite not carrying any cigarettes.  Suddenly, the shopkeeper heard screams and a large commotion. As he stepped outside his store he saw the same young man stabbing a Jewish settler with a knife, before taking the settlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gun and shooting another settler.  The shopkeeper ducked back inside his store. Later he would tell local media that he had never seen anyone carrying out such an attack with such quiet calmness, almost with serenity.  The young man was Muhannad Halabi, a law student at the al-Quds University, who was just a few weeks short of his 20th birthday. Israeli forces shot him dead at the scene, but not before he had killed two Israelis and injured two others.  HalabiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s act was lauded by Palestinians as the spark of the October 2015 uprising. His stabbing and shooting of settlers had opened up the way for a surge of attacks carried out by individual Palestinians Ã¢â‚¬â€œ politically unaffiliated, mostly under the age of 25 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ against Israelis in the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and modern day Israel.  READ MORE: Intifada or not, something powerful is going on  Shafiq Halabi, MuhannadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, told Al Jazeera that the youth had followed their heart, and were not guided by anyone.  ""They saw that there was no alternative to the oppression they lived under except for resistance,"" Halabi said.  Two years on, the attacks have abated, and are marked more by their sporadic nature, leaving at least 285 Palestinians and 42 Israelis killed.  According to the Palestinian Prisoners Centre for Studies, 14,000 Palestinians have arrested between October 2015 - September 2017, including 3,100 children and 437 women.  The latest attack was carried out by a Nimer Jamal, a Palestinian worker and father of four from the northwest Jerusalem town of Beit Surik, where he shot and killed four Israeli security officers in the settlement he worked in, Har Adar.  'Spark of waves'  What was once hyped up as the third Palestinian Intifada had stuttered to intermittent attacks. According to Ramallah-based political analyst Hani al-Masri, it was only to be expected that the momentum which had initially carried the October uprising would not expand into a fully-fledged intifada.  ""This was an intifada of waves, or a spark of waves, a reaction,Ã¢â‚¬Â Masri told Al Jazeera. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was the result of the absence of a plan of action by the Palestinian leadership- in that they did not present an effective strategy to confront the occupation.""  Instead, the ""wave"" of actions carried out by Palestinians, while indicative of the current situation of the population in general, do not express an organised effort that can be accumulated into a sustainable movement.  READ MORE: How Palestinian students prepare for settler attacks  In order for an intifada to be inclusive, Masri continued, it must have a unified leadership, an agenda, and a goal. The political division between Fatah and Hamas has drained the energy of the Palestinian people, he added.  ""If the recent reconciliation efforts succeed, this will pave the ground for a broad resistance model,"" he said.  ""Yet the leadership we are saddled with does not believe in an intifada or a comprehensive resistance as a technique,"" he said, referring to the Palestinian Authority.  ""This is what it fears because it sees it as a threat against its own limited rule and were it to happen, cannot control it. This is why the attacks occur in waves.""  Retaining dignity  Muhannad HalabiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral was the largest the West Bank had witnessed since the end of the second Intifada in 2005. Tens of thousands participated in the procession, where he was laid to rest wrapped in a lawyer's robe.  At the time, Palestinian media had peddled the line that Muhannad had carried out his attack to avenge the murder of his friend and fellow university student Dia Talahmeh.  Talahmeh, 21, had set up an ambush for an Israeli army patrol in the Palestinian village of Kharsa. Witnesses said that he had thrown an IED at the patrol, which exploded prematurely. The soldiers shot Talahmen once in the head, and five times in his body.  READ MORE: West Bank villagers decry collective punishment  But Shafiq Halabi said his son was more affected by the images of Palestinian women being physically assaulted by Israeli security forces in the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and the massacres of Palestinians during IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2014 war on the Gaza Strip.  ""Muhannad wasn't influenced by DiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s martyrdom,"" he said. ""They knew each other in university but were not close, as far as I know. Muhannad was influenced more by the unbearable status quo and how there was nothing done to better it,"" adding that his attack on the settlers was done to retain ""dignity for Palestinians"".  Violence encountered in daily life  Akram Rjoub, the governor of Nablus, told Al Jazeera that Palestinians are not inclined to violence.  ""But when Israel crosses every moral line possible, no one can predict what the response of the Palestinians will be, much less the reactions of the youth who find themselves surrounded on all sides by oppression that seeks to destroy their dignity,"" he said.  The events of the past two years, Rjoub said, had everything to do with the violent policies of the Israeli occupation that Palestinians encounter in their everyday lives.  ""The violation of the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, the continued expropriation of lands, the Israeli governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rhetoric and support for settlements, the price tag acts on places of worship, the burning alive of Palestinians such as the Dawabsheh family and Mohammad Abukhdeir Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of this is what drove some of the Palestinian youth to carry out attacks against Israelis,"" he said.  The Israeli army has been using collective punishment as a deterrence to stop the attacks by Palestinians. Punitive measures such as the demolishment of family homes of the Palestinian who carried out an attack is but one example.  The revoking of travel or work permits of relatives of the Palestinian attacker has become the norm, as well as the arrest and detainment of parents and siblings. Sometimes, these measures extend to an entire area, such as imposing the closure of the village or town the Palestinian attacker is from.  PA President Mahmoud Abbas has been quick to distance himself from the attacks, contributing to the growing sense of disillusionment of Palestinians with his government.  ""I'd be crazy if I told my son that stabbing someone was a good act,"" he once said, after he sent security forces to search through the schoolbags of Palestinian children for knives.  'Attacks will continue'  Shafiq Halabi, whose eldest son Mohammad was arrested by Israel in the wake of MuhannadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack and whose home was demolished three months after, said that he views the actions of the youth as proof that they still have an awareness and a sense of belonging to their homeland, in spite of their reality.  It is not a coincidence that the older generation, those who witnessed the first Intifada and were active in the 70s and 80s, are not part of the wave, he said.  ""The state of these youths is humiliating,"" he said. ""They have witnessed 24 years of the PA doing nothing to improve their lives, which is constantly getting from bad to worse.  ""As long as the Israeli violence and crimes continue then these attacks will also carry on,"" he said.  Source: Al Jazeera",en,terrorattack,,

The videos, provided to CNN by the International Rescue Committee, show children being treated for possible symptoms of the infectious disease in hospitals and mobile health units in the city of Aden and other areas in southern Yemen in late August.  A ravaged health care system, devastated infrastructure and near famine -- the results of a bloody civil war that began in March 2015 -- have all contributed to the spread of what the World Health Organization has described as ""the worst cholera outbreak in the world.""  The United Nations has counted 777,229 suspected cases as of October 2, many of them in children. As of September 13, there were 2,074 known deaths from cholera across the country, according to the WHO, with previous reports estimating that 5,000 people were being infected each day.  Mohammed Alawi Hadi, 6, and his brother Salih Alawi Hadi, 3, are treated for cholera at a hospital in Aden.

The strategy has come under fire recently after a raid earlier this year resulted in American casualties. The Trump administration has made a renewed push in the region to establish footholds of stability where radical Islamist terrorism cannot flourish.  Critics of American strategy in Africa worry that the U.S. is relying too heavily on corruptible military partners in the fight against radical Islamist groups like al-Shabab, or Boko Haram and Al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) further west in countries like Niger.  THREE GREEN BERETS KILLED TWO WOUNDED IN NIGER AMBUSH  Ã¢â‚¬Å“You can watch in Mali and Somalia, the local militaries have swept through populated areas and cleared them,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a little bit blind to the methods that the governments have been using to fight these groups. For example, the methods that the Nigerian government used to fight Boko Haram stoked the insurgency.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The three Green Berets were part of a squad of Ã¢â‚¬Å“eight to 10Ã¢â‚¬Â soldiers assigned to train Nigerien Armed Forces in their efforts against Al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) and other groups affiliated with ISIS.  Meanwhile, the Islamist terror group al-Shabab claimed it was tipped off ahead of time about a joint U.S. Navy SEAL-Somali Armed Forces raid on May 4. A SEAL, Senior Chief Petty Officer Kyle Milliken, was killed in the intense firefight.  TRUMP TARGETS AFRICA: INSIDE AMERICA'S QUIET WAR AGAINST TERROR    While itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unclear if al-Shabab was indeed tipped off by U.S.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Somali allies ahead of the raid, experts like Zimmerman believe such incidents show a real weakness in the strategy.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve convinced ourselves that working by and through a partner is going to solve the problem,Ã¢â‚¬Â she told Fox News. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But in many cases, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making the problem weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to solve worse.Ã¢â‚¬Â  President Trump, who was elected partly for resisting foreign entanglements requiring large numbers of American troops, has nevertheless taken notice of the growing terrorist presence on the African continent. High-ranking members of his administration have been working on a strategy since the early days of his presidency.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our intent is to train and assist the African armies as much as possible, let them have the lead in fighting radical Islamist terrorists,Ã¢â‚¬Â said retired four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a high-risk strategy that is still taking shape. And while the bulk of the resources are focused on East African countries like Somalia, the U.S. military is committing troops all across the African continent. Every official who spoke with Fox News emphasized that the objective is to help African nations protect themselves.  UN STUDY: YOUNG AFRICAN EXTREMISTS ARE DEPRIVED AND JOBLESS  Ã¢â‚¬Å“African solutions for African problems,Ã¢â‚¬Â said an AFRICOM spokesman.  While former President Obama began the African troop build-up, it came after his top commanders realized mistakes had been made. And, experts say, Obama resisted the recommendations from his generals when it came to figuring out how to solve the problem.  U.S. officials admitted in 2012 that the rise of Islamist groups in Africa, such as Al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM), which operates in West Africa and may have been behind the fight with the Green Berets in Niger, had caught them flat-footed. In July 2012, AFRICOMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commander said that AQIM had become a Ã¢â‚¬Å“much more difficultÃ¢â‚¬Â threat.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We missed an opportunity to deal with AQIM when they were weak,Ã¢â‚¬Â U.S. Army Gen. Carter Ham said at the time.  The Obama Administration was divided over how to tackle the rising threat. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do we or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t weÃ¢â‚¬Â deploy drones, was a big part of the conversation as late as 2012, according to the Washington Post.  While ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes gradually ramped up Special Forces and drones in Africa, he kept a close lid on their ability to make tactical decisions on when and where to strike, over fear of civilian casualties.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This was the Ben Rhodes machine. They did not trust the military to make these tactical decisions on their own in places like Somalia so it was very carefully managed,Ã¢â‚¬Â said one source with knowledge of the inner workings of the Obama White House.  Keane said Trump has given U.S. operational commanders considerable more authority.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He has decided to leave the employment of the force up to the discretion of the commanders,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not up to Washington.Ã¢â‚¬Â  AFRICOM tells Fox News at any given time there are approximately 5,000 to 6,000 U.S. personnel on the continent. The bulk of which, 4,000 or so, are based at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, which is often a staging ground for operations in both Somalia and Yemen, across the Gulf of Aden.  There are at least three drone bases in Africa Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Djibouti, Cameroon and Niger. There is a suspected base in Tunisia, but that has not been confirmed by the U.S. military.  While there are reports of many more bases that are either temporary or staging grounds for equipment, AFRICOM says it maintains Ã¢â‚¬Å“15 enduring locations.Ã¢â‚¬Â The Pentagon defines an enduring location as characterized Ã¢â‚¬Å“primarily by the sustained presence of allocated U.S. Forces."" They span the continent. And some take issue with the idea that U.S. special operators are there in truly Ã¢â‚¬Å“advise and assistÃ¢â‚¬Â roles, particularly because of what happened on May 4 with Milliken.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There has been an overreliance on special operations as a force multiplier,Ã¢â‚¬Â said retired Navy SEAL Scott Taylor, now a Republican congressman in Virginia. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Obama administration wanted to show there were no boots on the groundÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but there were boots on the ground. They would say they were advisers but of course they were there. This administration has changed it a little bit but there is still this overlap. I think we have to be more discriminatory in how we use our tier one special forces.Ã¢â‚¬Â  AFRICOM insists itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing just that, and it points to the thousands of troops deployed on the continent on missions, including U.S. Army First Lt. Soule Malame. Reached at Garoua airfield in Cameroon, where the U.S. operates surveillance drones, Malame told Fox News about how he left the West African country of Togo when he was 24 and is now back in Africa working with a unit designed to win hearts and minds.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The message weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to get across here is: Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhat can we do to provide security for your area? What can we do together?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Malame said the enemy in the area is Boko Haram, the group that spurred the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save Our GirlsÃ¢â‚¬Â movement after it kidnapped 276 young women from a Nigerian school in 2014. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They use the religion to serve themselves. They come and say Americans are bad people, not your friend. We want you to join us so you can fight them.Ã¢â‚¬Â  But Malame says the Cameroon villagers open up to him when they hear his local brand of French and learn that he, like them, is a Muslim.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa come looking for money and looking for influence. But they will use the money not to serve God but their own purpose,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I tell the villagers, they are not Muslims. Muslims will not come and tell them to kill people for no reason, and rape women, and kidnap girls. We, the Americans, are here to help them.Ã¢â‚¬Â  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tall order, not least because of the tyranny of distance in Africa, and compounded by the U.S.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ reliance on shaky local governments to finish the job.",en,terrorattack,139,['US']

LAS VEGAS - Las Vegas had spent years planning for the worst: training its police force according to an anti-terrorism protocol it adopted in 2009 to respond to mass shootings, chemical attacks, suicide bombings, and planes flying into buildings, according to city officials and security professionals.  But when it came to Sunday night's attack that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more at an open-air concert in the city, police found themselves with few options to stop the gunman quickly, they said.  It underscored the difficulty American cities face in protecting citizens from attacks that can take unpredictable forms.  Firing from the 32nd floor of a hotel near the city's world famous neon-lit Strip, at night, at a range of 500 yards (457m) with an arsenal of high-velocity semi-automatic weapons modified to shoot rapidly, gunman Stephen Paddock had pulled the city into a nightmare that left him virtually unopposed for crucial minutes, with police unable to safely return fire.  The angles, the distances, and the presence of thousands of people made it impossible, they said.  ""Our officers showed incredible restraint. They can fire that distance. It's not safe to do so,"" said Robert Chamberlin, a member of the Las Vegas police department's counter-terrorism force.  ""You are firing 32 floors up, from 500 metres. So the trajectory of our rounds... even if we were accurate, they're going to go up into the ceiling, up into the next floor.  ""(Our officers) knew they had to close, so that's what they did,"" he said.  Paddock sprayed bullets continuously on the concert crowd of 22,000 people for about 10 minutes, starting at 10.05pm, according to Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. Police blew open Paddock's hotel room door 75 minutes after the shooting started, finding he had killed himself.  Paddock's attack was only the second major mass shooting in modern US history where the gunman fired from an elevated position, according to David Shepherd, a former FBI agent who advises the Las Vegas police department on security issues.  The last one that inflicted large numbers of casualties was at the University of Texas in 1966 when a gunman in a tower killed 15 people and wounded 31 during an attack that lasted 96 minutes.  'MACTAC' PROTOCOL  In 2009, the Las Vegas police adopted a new, military-style, counter-terrorism plan and training, called Mactac, or Multi-Assault Counter-Terrorism Action Capabilities and intended to help it deal with attacks. Officials said it was instituted as a response to the attack on Mumbai, India a year earlier, in which Al-Qaeda-linked militants killed 166 people in a series of coordinated shootings and bombings over four days.  The protocol required every law enforcement officer from every department in the region to be trained in the same way to respond to attacks, members of the Mactac team told Reuters in an interview this week. This training allowed security personnel from different departments to team up quickly, form small units, and - in the case of a shooting - to direct fire at the shooter's location from different angles.  On Sunday, Paddock's high perch in a hotel filled with people complicated the well-trained response - first, because it was hard to exactly pinpoint his location, and second because of the dangers to bystanders if the police fired back.  ""It did cause some challenges logistically, being outgunned like that,"" said Lieutenant Reggie Rader, one of the Mactac team members. He said officers did their best to get as quickly as possible to the hotel room from which Paddock was firing.  City councilmen Ricki Barlow and Steve Seroka praised the police for how they responded to Sunday's attack, but admitted the shooter proved a difficult adversary, and that being prepared for every kind of attack is hard.  ""Someone shooting high down into a crowd - of course we have looked at that. But the question becomes - how do you guard against that?"" said Barlow.  Seroka said that many hotels in Las Vegas are equipped with technology to detect projectiles like cigarette butts coming off balconies and to pinpoint the room, but said there are no balconies at the Mandalay Bay hotel where Paddock had set up.  Seroka, a former US Air Force colonel and veteran of both Gulf Wars, lamented the length of time Paddock ultimately had to shoot at the crowd.  ""Nine minutes is an eternity when you are taking fire,"" he said.  But he added: ""There is an old saying: No plan survives the first contact with the enemy. You cannot anticipate every possibility.""",en,terrorattack,141,['Las']

Most were killed, though some escaped and a few were taken prisoner, according to General Aboda.  On Friday, corpses of several militants lay where they had fallen, some with weapons still at their side. Downtown Hawija, the site of the heaviest fighting, was a jumble of collapsed walls and crushed storefronts.  Kareem Gita, a Shiite militiaman who commanded a checkpoint in the shattered city center Friday, said many militants had lost the will to fight.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Their leaders failed them,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A lot of fighters ran away. The rest, we killed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  A handful of militants remained holed up in the city on Friday, General Aboda said. He said Iraqi forces were searching for them as engineering teams worked to clear streets and buildings of roadside bombs and booby traps.  Fighting continued just outside the city. Gunfire rattled in the distance and pillars of black smoke spun skyward as Iraqi troops pursued fleeing militants north of Hawija. Col. Ryan Dillon, the spokesman for American-led coalition forces in Baghdad, said the militants were operating from a shrinking slice of territory.  Photo  Assuming HawijaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outlying districts are finally cleared, the Islamic State in Iraq would be left with a string of desert outposts in the Euphrates River valley and the city of Qaim on the Syrian border. The group still controls significant territory in Syria.  But the militants never made much of a stand in Hawija. For the first week or so, commanders said, some fought back as government troops squeezed them from three directions in outlying areas. Trapped, they made a final stand in the city center. After three days of urban fighting, commanders said, the battle ended on Thursday.

Soldiers said many had carried Islamic State fighters.  But virtually no destroyed military vehicles were visible, suggesting that militants in and around Hawija can no longer obtain the gun-mounted Humvees and armored troop carriers they used in Mosul.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to fight anymore,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Rohaid Talal, 22, a Shiite militiaman.  Before the operation, Iraqi forces dropped leaflets instructing residents to flee. About 75,000 to 80,000 took refuge in outlying districts, according to Naji Ibrahim Hawas, head of the Hawija provincial council. Those residential areas seemed mostly untouched.  For civilians, who began to emerge at the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s edge on Friday, the defeat of the Islamic State offered salvation after three years under the militantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ harsh rule. Like residents of other Sunni cities controlled by ISIS, they described public beheadings in the city square, people shot in the foot if caught with a cellphone, and beatings for such offenses as wearing dishdasha hems too low or beards too short.

Abdul Basit, 21, who like Mr. Jasim remained in the Hawija district under ISIS rule, said he was shocked that so many militants had fled without a fight because they had seemed so terrifying and ruthless.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just seeing their faces and their beards made me tremble,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mr. Basit said.  The sight of Shiite militiamen parading through a Sunni city did not seem to alarm many residents.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They helped liberate us,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mr. Hawas, the provincial council leader. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We prefer anyone to Daesh,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

He said Shiite militia units will soon hand control of Hawija to local police and to Sunni tribal leaders.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  From 2005 to 2007, Sunnis and Shiites fought a brutal civil war. In 2013, Hawija was at the forefront of a brief uprising that pitted Sunni gunmen against the Shiite-dominated government of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, then the prime minister.  Human rights groups have accused Shiite militiamen in liberated Sunni cities such as Falluja of executing Islamic State prisoners and civilians accused of supporting them. Several militants who surrendered to Kurdish forces last week said they feared execution if captured by Shiite militiamen.  General Aboda said all militants captured in Hawija were turned over to Iraqi military intelligence officers.  The military coalition in Hawija included Iranian-trained militiamen, federal police officers and local Sunni tribal fighters. They were backed by American airstrikes and artillery.  Mr. Hawas and other Sunni residents complained about the Kurdish fighters known as pesh merga, who maintained defensive lines a few miles north of the city. They said the overwhelming vote last month for independence from Iraq for the Kurdish autonomous region had undercut the fight against the Islamic State. The Kurds should annul the vote, many said.  There are fears that Iraqi forces will clash with pesh merga fighters now that the two sidesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ front lines are closer after the fall of Hawija. Kurdish leaders and the government in Baghdad are locked in a tense confrontation over the vote, with Iraq threatening military and economic reprisals if the Kurds donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t annul the results.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If they insist on their independence, then of course we may have to fight them,Ã¢â‚¬Â General Aboda said. But he added that the police had been ordered by Baghdad to avoid any confrontation with Kurdish fighters.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They told us not to provoke anything,Ã¢â‚¬Â said another police commander in Hawija, Gen. Maitham al-Abbodi.  Despite the military triumph, not everyone was so sanguine about the end of Islamic State. Col. Kareem Aboud of a federal police SWAT unit, who was providing security for food deliveries to displaced Hawija district residents, said he was not convinced that the Islamic State was on the verge of complete defeat in Iraq.

ISTANBUL/BEIRUT: Turkey said on Saturday that it and Syrian rebel groups it backs are starting a military operation in Syria's Idlib, where a jihadist alliance is blocking efforts to impose a truce between insurgents and the Syrian government.  Idlib and surrounding areas of northwest Syria are among the largest bastions for rebel groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but have increasingly fallen under the sway of jihadist insurgent factions.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the operation, part of a de-escalation deal agreed between Turkey, Iran and Russia, will involve Syrian rebel groups crossing into Idlib supported by Turkish soldiers from inside Turkey's borders.  ""There's a serious operation in Syria's Idlib today and it will continue,"" Erdogan said in a speech to his AK Party.  ""Now this step has been taken, and it is underway,"" he said, adding that Turkish forces were not yet involved and that it was a rebel operation so far.  Russia, an ally of Assad, is backing the operation from the air, he said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Much of Idlib is controlled by the jihadist Tahrir al-Sham alliance, spearheaded by a former al Qaeda affiliate that changed its name last year from the Nusra Front.  ""We will never allow a terror corridor along our borders in Syria,"" Erdogan said. ""We will continue to take other initiatives after the Idlib operation.""  Tahrir al-Sham has pledged to keep fighting Syrian government forces and their allies, casting doubt on the de-escalation agreement, but Ankara has worked to lure militants from it and two groups have defected from the jihadist alliance.  Turkey launched an incursion into Syria further east of Idlib last year, backing Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups in the Euphrates Shield operation against Islamic State and Kurdish groups.  The FSA groups supported by Turkey are now ready to enter Idlib, Mustafa Sejari, a senior official in the Liwa al-Mutasem group said.  ""The Free Syrian Army with support from Turkish troops is in full readiness to enter the area but until this moment there is no movement,"" he said.  Erdogan said last month that Turkey would deploy troops in Idlib province as part of the de-escalation agreement brokered by Russia in August.  Another FSA rebel in the Euphrates Shield campaign told Reuters he believed an incursion into northwest Syria was imminent.  The Hamza Brigade, also part of Euphrates Shield, posted video online of what it said was a convoy of its forces heading for Idlib.  Residents near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey in Syria sent Reuters photographs of what they said was a section of the frontier wall being removed by the Turkish authorities.  Idlib's population has ballooned to at least two million as thousands of civilians and combatants have left areas seized by the Syrian army in other parts of the country, with the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias.

Ajnad Misr, or Soldiers of Egypt, were a group that emerged in January 2014 and targeted security forces in and around the Egyptian capital.  The group's leader was killed by security forces in 2015, and many of its remaining members are held in custody.  The court referred its sentencing recommendation to the country's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for a non-binding but legally required opinion.  Once that is received, the court will then formally announce its verdict on Dec. 7, after which time the sentence can be carried out.  Egypt is fighting an Islamist insurgency in Sinai that gained momentum in mid-2013 when the military ousted Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule. Hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed.  The Brotherhood says it is a peaceful movement but Egyptian security forces do not differentiate between it and groups such as Ajnad Misr and Islamic State, which has led the insurgency in recent years.

The attack took place near the city of Beni and, if the deaths are confirmed, would be the first mass-killing this year in that area. It has seen relative peace since more than 800 people were killed in dozens of massacres between 2014 and 2016.  The spate of attacks raised serious questions about the state's ability to impose order over a region full of ethnic tensions and plagued by pockets of lawlessness where armed groups prey on populations and exploit rich mineral reserves.  In the latest attack, on Saturday, assailants armed with machetes and guns ambushed travellers on the main road linking Beni in North Kivu province to neighboring Ituri province, Boris Maelezo, a member of parliament from the area, told Reuters.  He said about 30 civilians were riding on motorbikes, with several people on each vehicle, and that most of them could have been killed.  Albert Baliesima Kadukima, another lawmaker from the area, said two women freed by the militants had told local authorities the assailants had slit the throats of more than a dozen people.  Mak Hazukay, a local army spokesman, said Congolese forces were battling the militants and attempting to dislodge them from a section of the road that was several kilometers long.  The two lawmakers and the army spokesman said the militants belonged to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near the border between Congo and Uganda.  Eastern Congo is a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and has been racked by conflict for more than two decades. It is the world's biggest source of coltan, used in mobile phones and other electronic products.  Various armed groups have committed atrocities around Beni since late 2014 to settle scores and undermine rivals, with attacks sometimes sectarian in nature.

REUTERS/Jorge Silva  COXÃ¢â‚¬ËœS BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fled to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.  About 519,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state sparked a ferocious military response.  The European Union (EU) is proposing shunning contact with MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top generals as a first step towards new targeted sanctions to punish the military for the violence, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.  Reuters reporters on the Bangladeshi side of the border, in Palong Khali district, saw several thousand people crossing from northern Rakhine on Monday, filing along embankments between flooded fields and scrubby forest.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Half of my village was burnt down. I saw them do it,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Sayed Azin, 46, who said he had walked for eight days carrying his 80-year-old mother in a basket strung on a bamboo pole between him and his son.  Soldiers and Buddhist mobs had torched his village, he said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I left everything,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, sobbing. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find my relatives ... I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take this any more.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Some new arrivals spoke of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking towards the border.  Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have engaged in a campaign of killing and arson aimed at driving the Rohingya out of Myanmar.  Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labelled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.  Among those fleeing were up to 35 people on a boat that capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Sunday. At least 12 of them drowned while 13 were rescued, Bangladeshi police said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We faced so many difficulties, for food and survival,Ã¢â‚¬Â Sayed Hossein, 30, told Reuters, adding that his wife, three children, mother and father in law had drowned.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We came here to save our lives.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“GETTING WORSEÃ¢â‚¬Â  Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.  The United States and EU have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, though they are wary of action that could destabilise the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transition to democracy.  EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct. 16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc Ã¢â‚¬Å“will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officersÃ¢â‚¬Â.  A Rohingya refugees walks with a baby in a rice field after crossing the border in Palang Khali, Bangladesh October 9, 2017. REUTERS/Jorge Silva  Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action.  The Myanmar government has said its Ã¢â‚¬Å“clearance operationsÃ¢â‚¬Â against the militants ended in early September and people had no reason to flee. But in recent days the government has reported large numbers of Muslims preparing to leave, with more than 17,000 people in one area alone.  The government cited worries about food and security as their reasons.  Some villagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The situationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting worse. We have no food and no guarantee of security,Ã¢â‚¬Â said a Rohingya resident of Hsin Hnin Pyar village on the south of the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Buthidaung district.  He said a lot of people were preparing to flee.  Slideshow (18 Images)  Ã¢â‚¬Å“While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation,Ã¢â‚¬Â rights group Amnesty International said.  Senior state government official Kyaw Swar Tun declined to go into details when asked about the food, except to ask: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Have you heard of anyone dying of hunger in Buthidaung?Ã¢â‚¬Â  The reports of food shortages will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.  COMING, GOING  The insurgents declared a one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10 to enable the delivery of aid but the government rebuffed them, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.  The ceasefire is due to end at midnight on Monday, but the insurgents said in a statement they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government.  The ability of the group to mount any sort of challenge to the army is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the latest military offensive.  Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya who had fled earlier bouts of violence.  Mostly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as citizens, even though many have lived there for generations.  But even as refugees arrive, Bangladesh insists they will all have to go home. Myanmar has responded by saying it will take back those who can be verified as genuine refugees.  Many Rohingya fear they will not be able to prove their right to return.  The United States and Britain have warned Myanmar the crisis is putting at risk the progress it has made since the military began to loosen its grip on power in 2011.

Says",http://www.malaysiandigest.com/frontpage/29-4-tile/702263-cynical-myanmar-army-operation-aimed-at-preventing-rohingya-return-u-n-says.html,,11/10/2017 21:40,"Pic: Reuters  GENEVA: Myanmar security forces have brutally driven out half a million Muslim Rohingya from northern Rakhine state, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning, the U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday.  Jyoti Sanghera, head of the Asia and Pacific region of the U.N. human rights office, called on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to Ã¢â‚¬Å“stop the violenceÃ¢â‚¬Â and voiced fear that if the stateless Rohingya refugees return from Bangladesh they may be interned.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If villages have been completely destroyed and livelihood possibilities have been destroyed, what we fear is that they may be incarcerated or detained in camps,Ã¢â‚¬Â she told a news briefing.  In a report based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who have arrived in Bangladesh in the past month, it said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“clearance operationsÃ¢â‚¬Â had begun before insurgent attacks on police posts on Aug. 25 and included killings, torture and rape of children.  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid RaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœad al-Hussein - who has described the government operations as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a textbook example of ethnic cleansingÃ¢â‚¬Â - said in a statement that the actions appeared to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of returnÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Credible information indicates that the Myanmar security forces purposely destroyed the property of the Rohingyas, scorched their dwellings and entire villages in northern Rakhine State, not only to drive the population out in droves but also to prevent the fleeing Rohingya victims from returning to their homes,Ã¢â‚¬Â the report said.  It said the destruction by security forces, often joined by mobs of armed Rakhine Buddhists, of houses, fields, food stocks, crops, and livestock made the possibility of Rohingya returning to normal lives in northern Rakhine Ã¢â‚¬Å“almost impossibleÃ¢â‚¬Â.  The campaign was Ã¢â‚¬Å“well-organized, coordinated and systematicÃ¢â‚¬Â and began with Rohingya men under 40 being arrested a month earlier, creating a Ã¢â‚¬Å“climate of fear and intimidationÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are not in a position to make a finding of genocide or not, but this should in no way detract from the seriousness of the situation which the Rohingya population is currently facing,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Thomas Hunecke, who led the team that went to CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bazar, Bangladesh, from Sept. 14-24.  It was Ã¢â‚¬Å“highly likelyÃ¢â‚¬Â that Myanmar security forces planted landmines along the border in recent weeks to prevent Rohingya from returning, he said, citing doctors treating injuries.  VIOLENCE CONTINUES  Despite growing international condemnation of the crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.  Myanmar on Tuesday launched its first bid to improve relations between Buddhists and Muslims since the eruption of deadly violence inflamed the communal tension and triggered an exodus of some 520,000 Muslims to Bangladesh.  But Sanghera, noting that 11,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh on Monday alone, said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clearly it seems that some level of eviction, displacement, forced movement and violence may be continuing.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The U.N. experts documented Myanmar security forces Ã¢â‚¬Å“firing indiscriminately at Rohingya villagers, injuring and killing other innocent victims, setting houses on fireÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Almost all testimonies indicated that people were shot at close range and in the back while they tried to flee in panic,Ã¢â‚¬Â the report said.  The U.N. report quoted a 12-year-old girl from Rathedaung township as saying the security forces had surrounded her house and started shooting.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a situation of panic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they shot my sister in front of me, she was only seven years old. She cried and told me to run. I tried to protect her and care for her, but we had no medical assistance on the hillside and she was bleeding so much that after one day she died. I buried her myself.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The girl did not know what happened to her mother and four brothers, nor her father jailed a month earlier.  - Reuters",en,terrorattack,148,['Myanmar']

As of the end of September, at least 205 civilians had been killed and 261 wounded this year in air strikes in Afghanistan, U.N. investigators said in a quarterly report.  At least 38 percent of those casualties were caused by international military forces, while the majority were attributed to the Afghan Air Force, which has begun to conduct more attacks on its own.  More than two thirds of the civilian victims were women and children, the report said.  In September, U.S. warplanes dropped more bombs than in any single month since 2010, driven largely by TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategy of trying to reassert pressure on militants after several years of drawdown by foreign troops.  A spokesman for the U.S. military command did not immediately comment on the report.  General Dawlat Waziri, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defence, rejected the findings and said the government took civilian casualties seriously.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is quite obvious that Taliban and other insurgent groups cause more civilian casualties,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, adding that insurgents also Ã¢â‚¬Å“use civilians as human shields and hide in residential areasÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Overall civilian casualties decreased slightly compared to the same period last year, the report said.  At least 2,640 civilians were killed and 5,379 injured this year, compared to 2,616 killed and 5,915 injured in the same period of 2016.  The drop reflected fewer casualties from fighting in populated areas, the report noted, as militants failed to capture any major cities.  The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, praised the Afghan government for formally endorsing a national policy designed to reduce civilian casualties.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The government owes it to its citizens, particularly the victims of the armed conflict, to ensure full implementation of the policy through a concrete action plan,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Overall the U.N. attributed 64 percent of civilian casualties to anti-government militants like the Taliban and Islamic State.  Pro-government forces were responsible for 20 percent overall, while the remainder was attributed to joint fighting or unidentified groups, according to the U.N.  - Reuters",en,terrorattack,,

The convoy included about 30 military vehicles, said Abu Khairo, a commander in a Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group based in the area, and it entered Syria near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing, according to a civilian witness.  It was heading to Sheikh Barakat, a hilltop that overlooks large areas of rebel-held northwestern Syria, but also the Afrin area held by the Kurdish YPG militia.  The convoy was escorted by fighters from Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of jihadist groups including the former al Qaeda affiliate previously known as the Nusra Front, Abu Khairo said.  ""The Turkish army convoy is entering under the protection of Tahrir al-Sham to take positions on the front line with the YPG,"" another FSA official in the area said.  Turkey said on Saturday it was carrying out a military operation in Idlib and surrounding areas as part of a deal it reached with Russia and Iran last month to enforce a ""de-escalation"" zone in northwest Syria.  The zone is one of several set up around Syria to reduce warfare between rebels, including groups backed by Turkey, and the government, which is supported by both Russia and Iran.  Tahrir al-Sham opposes the de-escalation deal with the government, but its role in escorting the Turkish reconnaissance team on Sunday indicated there might not be any direct military confrontation between its fighters and Turkey.  The Turkish military operation in Idlib will also include Syrian rebel groups involved in the Euphrates Shield operation that Ankara launched in Syria last year further to the east, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday.  Tahrir al-Sham and Euphrates Shield rebels have fought previously and the jihadist alliance has this year battled other insurgents in Idlib and surrounding areas in an effort to consolidate its control.  Turkey's decision to launch the Euphrates Shield campaign a year ago was aimed partly at pushing Islamic State from its border, but also at stopping the Kurdish YPG from gaining more sway.  Backed by the United States in its battle against Islamic State, the YPG has seized much of northeastern Syria and was trying to link that territory up with its canton in Afrin.  Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that it is fighting at home, and by gaining a presence in Sheikh Barakat, its forces would surround Afrin on three sides.  Several Turkish military vehicles, ambulances and tankers were visible in photographs published by Turkey's Anadolu news agency late on Thursday stationed at a village near Turkey's Reyhanli border gate opposite Bab al-Hawa.

US President Donald Trump hailed the couple's freedom after five years held in the lawless Afghan-Pakistan border region by the notorious Haqqani network.  And he suggested the rescue was the result of his tougher diplomatic stance against Pakistan, which Washington has been pressuring over its support for some militant groups.  ""The Pakistani government's cooperation is a sign that it is honouring America's wish that it do more to provide security in the region,"" Trump told reporters.  ""They worked very hard on this, and I believe they're starting to respect the United States again,"" he said, adding that ""a lot"" of other nations were also showing greater deference to the US.  Defence Secretary Jim Mattis meanwhile praised the release as a positive step in often rocky US-Pakistan ties.  ""This is a very positive moment and the Pakistan army performed well. We will hopefully see it being a harbinger for the future,"" he told reporters on Thursday afternoon, without offering details about the nature of the operation.  Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle were kidnapped during a backpacking trip in Afghanistan in 2012, and had three children while in captivity.  A US military official said American forces were not involved in any rescue, but that a medical team had been able to meet the family and stood ready to fly them home if needed.  Another military official told AFP the couple was hesitating to board a US military jet in Pakistan over the Canadian husband's concerns he could face American scrutiny for links to a former Guantanamo captive.  In 2009, Boyle was briefly married to Zaynab Khadr, the sister of Canadian-born Omar Khadr, who spent a decade at Guantanamo.  But the official said Boyle did not risk any US repercussions.  ""It is not in our intention to do anything like that. We are prepared to bring them back home,"" the official said.  Trump identified the captors as the Haqqani group, whose head, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is also the Afghan Taliban's deputy leader.  Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland added that Boyle was not being investigated by Ottawa.  ""Let me be very clear and as we have been with the Boyle family,"" she said in a televised statement from Mexico where she was traveling. ""Joshua Boyle is not the subject of any investigation."" .  The Haqqani network has long been suspected of having links with Pakistan's shadowy military establishment.  In 2011, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, admiral Mike Mullen, described the Haqqani as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.  Pakistan has been under increased pressure from Washington to crack down on alleged militant sanctuaries inside its borders after Trump lambasted the country in a televised address in August.  During the speech, Trump accused Islamabad of sheltering ""agents of chaos"" and suggested ties with Pakistan would be adjusted immediately but offered few details.  Defence Secretary Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are expected in Pakistan in the coming weeks on separate visits, according to US and Pakistani sources, to maintain pressure on a country that was designated a major non-Nato ally by former president George W. Bush.  The Haqqani network has been accused of masterminding several high-profile terrorist attacks in the Afghan capital, including a massive truck bomb on May 31 that killed some 150 people.  They have been known to kidnap Western hostages and smuggle them across the Afghan border into Pakistan, as appears to have been the case with Coleman and Boyle.  The Pakistani military said the hostages had been ""recovered... from terrorist custody through an intelligence-based operation by Pakistani troops.""  They were found in Kurram district, part of Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal belt, where militants such as the Haqqanis operated with impunity until the army intensified an operation there in 2014.  ""US intelligence agencies had been tracking them and shared their shifting across to Pakistan on 11 Oct 2017 through Kurram Agency border,"" the Pakistani military said.  Boyle and Coleman appeared in a hostage video in December last year with two of their children pleading for their release.  The video was released after rumours swirled in Kabul that the government was planning to execute Anas Haqqani, son of the Haqqani network's founder, who has been held since 2014.  Freeland expressed relief at the release.  ""Joshua, Caitlan, their children and the Boyle and Coleman families have endured a horrible ordeal over the past five years,"" she said.  Afghanistan is rife with militants and organized criminal gangs who stage kidnappings for ransom, targeting wealthy Afghans and foreigners, who have been ferried over the border.  The Taleban are also thought to be holding American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weekes, professors at the American University of Afghanistan who were dragged from vehicles in Kabul by gunmen.",en,terrorattack,,

The teenager was among several people arrested for suspected involvement with terrorist groups, national police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said yesterday.  He declined to elaborate.  ""It is too early to reveal any details but I will release a statement about this in three days,"" he told reporters at a press conference at the Police Training Centre.  In a separate development, he said Malaysia's Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division had also arrested 45 foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) in a series of operations between January and Oct 6.  The arrests, Datuk Seri Mohamad Fuzi said in a statement, were made based on intelligence that remnants of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) had been instructed to infiltrate other countries to launch attacks after losing the majority of their bases in Iraq and Syria.  ""We also discovered cooperation between (ISIS) and other terrorist groups, including the ASG, in sending militants to Malaysia to launch attacks,"" he said, also referring to the Abu Sayyaf Group and Bangladesh terror group Jamaatul Mujahideen.  ""The ASG members who entered Malaysia are suspected to have planned on launching attacks here, but other terrorists (from different groups) on the other hand, are suspected of seeking shelter, collecting funds, planning to either launch attacks here or using Malaysia as their operation base to launch attacks at other countries,"" he said.  Mr Mohamad Fuzi added that the success of the police operations is the result of cooperation with foreign intelligence and enforcement agencies. ""The police will continue to monitor and take action against FTFs to make sure that all attempts to launch attacks (in Malaysia) are stopped.""  He also revealed that of the 45 foreign fighters detained, 31 were ISIS members, with three southern Iraq commanders among them.  The others comprise nine from ASG , three from the Fetullah Terrorist Organisation, one Albanian militant affiliated to ISIS, and another linked to Jamaatul Mujahideen.

Flies buzz around human remains poking through the dusty earth in the Iraqi town of Dhuluiyah, 90km north of Baghdad, at a hastily-dug pit containing the bodies of dozens of ISIS fighters killed in 2015.  ""They should have ended up in the stomachs of stray dogs,"" local police officer Mohammed al-Juburi told AFP.  ""We buried them here not out of love but because we wanted to avoid diseases.""  At one stage, ISIS ruthlessly wielded power over a vast swathe of territory straddling Iraq and Syria, but a military onslaught on multiple fronts has seen its fiefdom shrink to a last few pockets.  Since the launch in 2014 of air strikes in Iraq and Syria against the group, a US-led coalition says around 80,000 militants have been killed.  The overall number of dead is higher if you include those targeted by Russian and Syrian strikes.  Buried with bulldozers  In agricultural Dhuluiyah on the banks of the Tigris river, residents faced a common dilemma over what to do with the corpses of ISIS fighters after local Sunni militiamen beat back the militants in fierce clashes.  ""We could have thrown them into the water, but we love the river too much to pollute it,"" said the local policeman, who lost his own brother in the violence.  ""The people here as well as their animals drink from the Tigris.""  Locals finally decided to dig a mass grave for the fighters - but they said they refused to honour them with Islamic rites.  ""We buried them with bulldozers. Even in the ground they are still mired in their own filth,"" said farmer Shalan al-Juburi.  ""They said that they would go to paradise to enjoy the gardens of delights, but this is how they ended up.""  The desolate site is in stark contrast to a nearby graveyard surrounded by a red-brick wall a few hundred metres (yards) away.  There the ""martyrs"" who died helping to stop the militant advance lie in well-tended tombs adorned with their portraits and shaded by trees.  Elsewhere, in western Iraq's Anbar province, the luckiest among the ISIS dead appear to be those killed during its offensives against the army in 2015.  In the centre of Fallujah, the first major city captured by the group in 2014, hundreds of memorials in a makeshift cemetery bear the noms de guerre of foreign fighters buried by their comrades.  But as Iraqi forces in Anbar now look to oust the militants from their final footholds, operation commander Mahmoud al-Fellahi insisted any militants killed will end up in mass graves.  A similar fate befell ISIS members in the city of Mosul, the group's largest urban stronghold in Iraq that it lost in July.  There, a senior Iraqi commander told AFP, authorities used earthmoving equipment ""to bury the militants after we collected information on their identities and nationalities"".  'Desert dogs are waiting'  Across the border in Syria - where competing Russia and US-backed offensives are squeezing ISIS - the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates some 50,000 ISIS members have been killed.  As clashes rage with the militants, one Syrian commander said that what happens to dead fighters is not a priority.  ""At the moment, we are more interested in what happens above the ground than under it,"" he told AFP.  Another military source said the identities of the fighters can provide useful intelligence.  ""The terrorists try to collect their dead. If we find them, we try to identify the foreigners for a possible information swap with their home countries,"" the source said.  In the desert plains that the militants once dominated, the bodies of dead fighters are left abandoned, a pro-regime militia head told AFP.  ""The desert dogs are waiting for them,"" he said. ""When fighting ends, the militants come out of their hiding places to collect the remains.""  A spokesman for the US-backed force close to ousting ISIS from the city of Raqa said the bodies of the group's members were ""generally buried"" whenever possible.  ""But sometimes due to snipers or because they are under rubble, some of the bodies end up rotting,"" said Syrian Defence Forces representative Mustefa Bali.  While the rank-and-file are often left forgotten, ISIS appears to have taken care to hide the final resting places of prominent Western militants.  ""Figures who were well-known and wanted by the international community are buried at secret locations,"" said Syrian Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.  Those include notorious British executioner Mohamed Emwazi, known as ""Jihadi John"", propaganda chief Abu Muhammad al-Adnani and military leader Omar al-Shishani.  There has been no record of bodies of foreign militants being repatriated, said Abdel Rahman.",en,terrorattack,,

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) says it began the offensive on Sunday, after a convoy of IS fighters and their families left the city overnight, using civilians as human shields.  No foreign fighters were allowed to join them, and it is unclear how many militants remain in the city.  IS declared Raqqa the de facto capital of its ""caliphate"" three years ago.  The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, has been besieging the city for nearly four months.  In a statement released as the battle began, the group said they would not stop ""until the whole city is clean of the terrorists who refused to surrender, including the foreign fighters"".  The battle is still anticipated to take some time, with Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the US-led coalition, saying they ""still expect there to be difficult fighting"".  The SDF's decision to allow some of the militants to leave the city, leaving only a hardcore group of fighters behind, was designed to shorten the fight. It is not known how many remain.  The coalition said ""275 local mercenaries and their families"" had left Raqqa, according to news agency AP.  Omar Alloush, an official in the Raqqa Civil Council, said about 400 civilians also joined them.  Mostafa Bali, an SDF spokesman, told Reuters they were human shields who the militants refused to release until their own safety was guaranteed.  But the evacuation did not have the full support of their western backers.  Col Dillon said: ""We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.""  The loss of Raqqa will be seen as another blow for IS, which has been steadily losing ground in both Syria and Iraq over the last two years.

Pro-ISIS gunmen occupied parts of Marawi, the Islamic capital of the mainly Catholic Philippines, on May 23.  Since then 822 militants, 162 government forces and 47 civilians have been killed, Brawner said.  The insurgents have withstood a relentless US-backed bombing campaign and intense ground battles with troops that have left large parts of Marawi resembling devastated cities in war-torn Syria and Iraq.  Military commanders last week set a target of Oct 15 to end the fighting and President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday said the battle was ""almost over"".  Twenty soldiers were wounded on Saturday in a sign troops were pushing hard to end the battle, Brawner said.  He said 40 militants remained in the conflict area including leaders Isnilon Hapilon, who is on America's list of most wanted terrorists with a US$5 million (S$6.75 million) bounty, and Omarkhayam Maute, whose group had pledged allegiance to ISIS.  There were also 100 civilians in the zone including hostages and families of the militants, he added.  ""Women and children are now forced to fight together with the Maute-ISIS fighters.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi gave orders to the security forces Ã¢â‚¬Å“to impose security in Kirkuk in cooperation with the population of the city and the Peshmerga,Ã¢â‚¬Â the TV said.  The elite, US-trained Ã¢â‚¬Å“Counter Terrorism Service, the 9th armoured division and Federal Police have taken control of vast areas of Kirkuk without confrontations,Ã¢â‚¬Â it said, adding that oilfields and Kurdish military positions were captured.  But a KRG security official denied that Iraqi forces were able to get closer to the city or take territory from the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.  The official told Reuters the oilfields and the air base west of Kirkuk were still under Kurdish control.  The US Defence Department urged Iraqi and Kurdish forces Ã¢â‚¬Å“to avoid additional escalatory actions,Ã¢â‚¬Â saying in a statement it opposed destabilising actions that detract from the battle against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants. The United States provided weapons to both the Iraqi army and the Peshmerga to fight ISIS militants.  The conflict in Iraq helped spur a jump in world oil prices on Monday.  The most serious clash happened south of Kirkuk, an exchange of artillery fire between the Peshmerga and Popular Mobilisation, the KRG official said.  Popular Mobilisation is a mainly ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite Iraqi paramilitary force trained and armed by Iran, which is providing support to the Iraqi operation in Kirkuk, according to state TV.  The Iraqi government and the KRG have been at loggerheads since a Sept 25 Kurdish independence referendum, rejected as illegal by Baghdad.  Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic city with a large Kurdish community, shaped up as a flashpoint as it is claimed by both sides.  Residents of Kirkuk said there was no sign the Iraqi forces were getting close to the city itself, which is under the control of the Kurdish Asayish police.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœMAJOR OPERATIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  Tension was running high at the news of the Iraqi operation and young Kurds carrying automatic guns were seen in the streets until the early hours of Monday.  There were clashes between Kurdish and ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite Turkmen groups in another city, Tuz Khormatu, about 75 km south of Kirkuk, but no casualties were reported.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Iraqi forces and Popular Mobilisation are now advancing from Taza, south of Kirkuk, in a major operation,Ã¢â‚¬Â the KRG Security Council said in a statement around midnight.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Their intention is to enter the city and take over the K1 air base and oil fields,Ã¢â‚¬Â all located west of the city, it said.  The Iraqi forcesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ operation in the region of Kirkuk followed meetings held on Sunday by the Iraqi government in Baghdad and the Kurdish leadership in the town of Dokan.  It also coincided with a visit by Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani to the Kurdistan region. He is the commander of foreign operations for IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite Revolutionary Guards who provide training and guns to Popular Mobilisation.  KRG President Masoud Barzani and top Kurdish officials who met in Dokan rejected the Iraqi governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demand that it cancel the outcome of the independence referendum as a precondition for talks to resolve the dispute.  Kirkuk, a city of more than a million people with a large Kurdish community, lies just outside KRG territory, but Peshmerga forces were stationed there in 2014 when Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught.  The Peshmerga deployment prevented KirkukÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.  The Baghdad central government has taken a series of steps to isolate the autonomous Kurdish region since its vote for independence, including banning international flights.  BaghdadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tough line, ruling out talks sought by the Kurds unless they renounce the breakaway move, is backed by neighbours Turkey and Iran Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both with their own sizeable Kurdish minorities, and in TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case, a long-running Kurdish insurgency.

The group is waging an insurgency against SomaliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.  The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have been steadily losing territory since then to the combined forces of AU peacekeepers and Somali security forces.  But Al Shabaab retains the capacity to mount large, complex bomb attacks. Over the past three years, the number of civilians killed by insurgent bombings has steadily climbed as al Shabaab increases the size of its bombs.  Some of those seriously injured in SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bombing were moved by ambulance to the airport on Monday morning to be flown to Turkey for further treatment, Nur added.  Workers unloaded boxes of medicine and other medical supplies from a Turkish military plane parked on the tarmac, while Turkish medical teams attended to the cases of injuries moved from the hospital for evacuation.",en,terrorattack,162,['Somalia']

Hundreds more were wounded when a lorry packed with explosives detonated near the entrance of a hotel.  It is the deadliest terror attack in Somalia since the Islamist al-Shabab group launched its insurgency in 2007.  President Mohamed Abdullahi ""Farmajo"" Mohamed blamed the attack on them, calling it a ""heinous act"".  No group has yet said it was behind the bombing.  ""Brothers, this cruel act was targeted at civilians who were going about their business,"" the president said.  He has declared three days of mourning for the victims of the blast.  Local media reported families gathering in the area on Sunday morning, looking for missing loved ones amid the ruins of one of the largest bombs ever to strike the city.  Police official Ibrahim Mohamed told AFP news agency the death toll was likely to rise. ""There are more than 300 wounded, some of them seriously,"" he said.  Officials also confirmed that two people were killed in a second bomb attack in the Madina district of the city.  Mogadishu's Mayor Thabit Abdi called for unity while addressing a crowd of people who had gathered to protest.  ""Oh, people of Mogadishu, Mogadishu shouldn't be a graveyard for burnt dead bodies,"" he said.  ""Mogadishu is a place of respect, and if we remain united like we are today, moving ahead, we will surely defeat the enemy, Allah willing.""  A BBC Somali reporter at the scene of the main blast said the Safari Hotel had collapsed, with people trapped under the rubble.  An eyewitness, local resident Muhidin Ali, told AFP it was ""the biggest blast I have ever witnessed, it destroyed the whole area"".  Meanwhile, the director of the Madina Hospital, Mohamed Yusuf Hassan, said he was shocked by the scale of the attack.  ""Seventy-two wounded people were admitted to the hospital and 25 of them are in very serious condition. Others lost their hands and legs at the scene.  ""What happened yesterday was incredible, I have never seen such a thing before, and countless people lost their lives. Corpses were burned beyond recognition.""

MARAWI: Philippine troops were Tuesday hunting down a Malaysian militant tipped to take over as the head of the Islamic State group in Southeast Asia, after the killing of the organisationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former leader.  Mahmud Ahmad is the top remaining target for Philippine forces battling to end the nearly five-month siege of Marawi that has claimed more than 1,000 lives and left the Muslim-majority city in ruins.  The military claimed a major breakthrough Monday when it announced the death of Isnilon Hapilon, said by President Rodrigo Duterte and security analysts to be a key figure in the IS push to establish a Southeast Asian caliphate as they suffer battlefield defeats in Iraq and Syria.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mahmud remainsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ one of our high-value targets in the operations being conducted,Ã¢â‚¬Â military spokesman Major-General Restituto Padilla said Tuesday.  He added troops were fighting in a zone comprising about 60 to 80 buildings in the ruined city.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are focused on a ground offensive because the fighting is too close.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Padilla said Mahmud Ahmad was among 20 to 30 militants, including up to eight foreign fighters, remaining in Marawi, Padilla said. They are still holding about 20 hostages.  Terrorism expert Ahmad Kumar Ramakrishna from SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies said if Mahmud Ahmad survived he would likely take over the leadership of IS-linked fighters in the southern Philippines.  The militant is also reported to be a university lecturer in his home country who was in charge of raising finances from abroad for the jihadists and recruitment.  Pro-IS gunmen occupied parts of Marawi, the Islamic capital of the mainly Catholic Philippines, on May 23 following a foiled attempt by security forces to arrest Hapilon, authorities said.  The military said Monday Hapilon Ã¢â‚¬â€ who figured on the US Ã¢â‚¬Å“most wanted terroristsÃ¢â‚¬Â list Ã¢â‚¬â€ was killed in a dawn offensive alongside Omarkhayam Maute, one of two brothers who allied with Hapilon to plot the takeover of the city.  Since then more than 1,000 people have been killed and 400,000 residents displaced as insurgent were hit with a relentless US-backed bombing campaign and intense ground battles with troops.  The restive south of the Philippines is home to a decades-old Muslim separatist insurgency and to extremist gangs that have declared allegiance to IS, including notorious kidnap-for-ransom group Abu Sayyaf and Maute groups.  On Tuesday, the military said it raised the alert level in a part of the southern Philippines as it warned against retaliatory attacks from sympathisers of the militants.  The directive included tightening border security to prevent militants from moving around the archipelago.  The United States, a longtime defence ally of the Philippines, vowed on Tuesday to support the militaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final push in Marawi.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The US Government will continue to work with the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the final phases of this operation, and looks forward to cooperating in assuring the stabilisation and rehabilitation of Marawi,Ã¢â‚¬Â US embassy press attache Molly Koscina told AFP.",en,terrorattack,,

A regional security source told Channel NewsAsia that Mahmud is believed to be dead after being killed by the Philippine military during operations two days ago to clear the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battle area of remaining terrorists.

Isnilon and Omar were both killed in combat, announced the Philippine Defence Secretary on Monday. The fate of Abdullah Maute is unknown.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mahmud is believed to have been together with Isnilon and Omar based on monitoring of their communications,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the regional source. He gave no details as to whether Mahmud was in the same spot when Isnilon and Omar were were killed.    According to the military, Mahmud channeled US$600,000 and recruited men for the Marawi attack that has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced 400,000 residents.

REUTERS/Jorge Silva  Mahmud, 39, holds a doctorate in religious studies and was a university lecturer in Kuala Lumpur. He was Hapilon's second-in-command in the IS' Southeast Asia ""caliphate"", according to a July report by Indonesia-based Institute of Policy Analysis and Conflict (IPAC).    In June, a senior Malaysian intelligence official told Channel NewsAsia that Mahmud was highly dangerous and that he was the brains behind the Maute and IS factions of the Abu Sayyaf groups.    Together with Isnilon Hapilon, he had planned to set up an IS territory.  Mahmud is also known to have recruited and arranged for the passage of Malaysians to Syria to join IS, including the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first suicide bomber, Ahmad Tarmimi Maliki.    He fled Malaysia for southern Philippines in 2014 along with two other associates, after receiving word that the police were after him.  ",en,terrorattack,,

The Central Military Media said on Wednesday that Brig. Gen. Issam Zahreddine was killed in Hawija Saqr, east of Deir el-Zour, in operations against IS militants.  The Lebanese Al-Manar TV, which is close to the Syrian government, said a land mine killed him.  Zahreddine was a key commander in the Syrian army, maintaining a government presence in Deir el-Zour despite a nearly three years-long siege on his forces. The siege was breached in September in a Russian-backed offensive, and the government and allied troops have since seized most of the city.  Zahreddine, who was in his late 50s, also led government offensives against armed opposition in the central Homs province and near the capital, Damascus, in the earlier days of the Syrian conflict.  In comments widely played after Deir el-Zour's siege was breached, Zareddine warned those who fled the country not to return because the army ""will never forget or forgive."" He later apologized on state TV.  ___  11:30 a.m.  The spokesman for U.S.-backed forces fighting Islamic State militants in Syria says the fighters are removing land mines and clearing main roads in the city of Raqqa, a day after they announced it was captured.

The man, identified only as Yamen A, 19, was held at dawn by special forces in the northeastern town of Schwerin, the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement.  Several apartments were also searched in the region, which is north of Berlin.  The man is suspected of having ""planned and already concretely prepared an Islamist-motivated attack in Germany using very powerful explosives,"" a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, Frauke Kohler, told reporters.  In a statement, the office said the man had made a decision ""no later than July 2017 to explode a bomb in Germany with the aim of killing and wounding as many people as possible.""  ""It has not yet been established whether the suspect already had a target in mind or not,"" it said, adding that prosecutors did not have any information on whether the suspect belonged to ""a terrorist organisation"".  Advertisement  Advertisement  In the following weeks, he began to acquire the chemical products and materials necessary to build a bomb.  ""A serious attack has been prevented,"" German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in a statement.    ""This action came at exactly the right moment: late enough that the necessary evidence had been gathered but early enough to eliminate any potential danger"".    He added: ""The threat level in Germany remains high"".    German police have been on high alert over potential extremist attacks, particularly since December last year when a man hijacked a truck and ploughed into shoppers at a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people.    The attacker was shot dead by police in Milan four days later, and the rampage was claimed by the Islamic State militant group.    An investigation pointed to a catalogue of ""gross mistakes"" by security services in the lead-up to the attack.    '10,000 RADICALS'    The scathing report found that authorities had missed several opportunities to arrest and deport the driver, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri.  The 24-year-old, who had previously been jailed in Italy, had been in touch with extremists and sold drugs in Berlin. He had managed to escape detection by skipping across German state lines and using different identities.    Last July, a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum seeker wielding a knife stormed into a supermarket in Hamburg, killing one person and wounding six others before being detained by passers-by.    German prosecutors said the man likely had a ""radical Islamist"" motive.    The intelligence services estimate there are around 10,000 radicals in Germany, some 1,600 of whom are suspected of being capable of using violence.    IS claimed responsibility for a number of other attacks in 2016, including the murder of a teenager in Hamburg, a suicide bombing in the southern city of Ansbach that wounded 15, and an axe attack on a train in Bavaria that left five injured.    Chancellor Angela Merkel has allowed in more than one million asylum seekers in the past two years - a decision that has driven the shock rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.    The arrest on Tuesday came as Merkel's conservative CDU party was in talks with the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) to form a coalition government.    One of the main points of friction in the talks is Germany's position on migrants, with the CDU and the FDP hoping to clamp down on new arrivals while the Greens want to maintain a more welcoming stance.",en,terrorattack,,

BENGHAZI, Libya: A man seized by U.S. forces in Libya accused of involvement in an attack that killed the U.S. Ambassador in Benghazi in 2012 is a Syrian who had links to the suspected ringleader, Libyan military officials said on Tuesday.  U.S. special forces captured Mustafa al-Imam in the past few days and he is being transported to the United States, U.S. officials said on Monday, without giving more details.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, eastern-based military officials told Reuters Imam was believed to be a Syrian national aged between 35 and 40.  He had lived in the Benghazi district of Laithi where he frequented the same Al-Awza'i mosque as suspected ringleader Ahmed Abu Khatallah who was snatched by U.S. forces in 2014, the officials said.  U.S. prosecutors opened their case against Abu Khatallah this month.  Imam has been charged with ""killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility"" and providing ""material support to terrorists resulting in death,"" the U.S. Justice Department said. He will appear before a federal judge in Washington when he arrives in the United States.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Laithi was an Islamist stronghold that saw some of the heaviest fighting in a battle for control of Benghazi that began in 2014.  In July, eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar announced victory in the campaign, which pitted his Libyan National Army (LNA) against Islamists and other opponents.  Officials at the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli could not be reached for comment. The country has rival governments: one in the capital and another in the east allied to Haftar.  An eastern news agency backing the LNA published what it said was a picture of Imam standing in front of the Benghazi barracks of an armed group before it was taken by Haftar's forces. It said he had been captured by U.S. forces in the western city of Misrata.  The Benghazi attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton handled the attack.  Libya has been mired in conflict since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, with Islamists militants gaining ground as fighting between rival factions created a security void.

It was the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first terror incident since a pipe bomb exploded in September 2016 in Chelsea, lightly wounding 31 people. An American of Afghan descent, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, was convicted of terrorism on Oct 16 in relation with the attack.  Heavily armed police reinforcements were stepped up across the city of 8.5 million in the wake of that attack.

936106,todayonline,None,Kurds offer joint border deployment as Iraq threatens to resume military operations,http://www.todayonline.com/world/iraqs-kurdistan-offers-joint-kurdish-iraqi-deployment-crossing-turkey,,2/11/2017 19:50,"BAGHDAD - Iraq's Kurdistan region said on Thursday it has offered a joint Kurdish-Iraqi deployment at a strategic crossing into Turkey, with the participation of the U.S.-led coalition that was helping fight Islamic State.  The offer was disclosed hours after Iraqi armed forces accused the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of delaying the handover to Iraq of control of the borders with Turkey, Iran and Syria, and threatened to resume operations to capture Kurdish-held areas.  The KRG defense department said the offer was part of a ""deconfliction"" proposal made to the Iraqi government on Oct. 31.  The other points included a ceasefire on all fronts, continued cooperation in the fight against Islamic State and a joint deployment in so-called disputed territories, which are areas claimed by both the KRG and the Iraqi central government.  The KRG ""continues to welcome a permanent ceasefire on all fronts, deconfliction and the start of a political dialogue"" with Baghdad, the Kurdish statement said.  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered economic and military retaliation after Iraqi Kurds voted for independence in a referendum held in September that Baghdad declared illegal.  He insists that the KRG cancel the referendum's outcome as a pre-condition for any dialogue. Iran and Turkey back his measures against Iraq's Kurds, fearing the drive for independence will spread to their own Kurdish populations.  The joint deployment at the strategic Fish-Khabur crossing was meant ""as a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution"", the Kurdish statement said.  Fish-Khabur is strategically important for the Kurdistan region because it is the point where its oil pipeline crosses into Turkey.  Iraq's entire land border with Turkey is located inside the Kurdish autonomous region and has been controlled by the Kurds since before the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  Abadi declared a pause on Friday in an offensive that began on Oct. 16 to take over the disputed areas. The oil-rich city of Kirkuk fell on the same day without much fighting.  The Iraqi Joint Operations Command accused the KRG on Wednesday of using the talks that started on Friday to ""buy time"" to strengthen Kurdish lines.  ""We will not allow it; the federal forces are mandated to secure (the disputed) areas and borders,"" it said in a statement.  The Kurdish Peshmerga command also accused Iraqi forces on Wednesday of massing weapons and threatening force to resolve ""domestic political differences"".  Iraqi troops set up positions between Turkish and Iraqi Kurdish checkpoints on Tuesday at the Habur border crossing, between the Turkish town of Silopi and the Iraqi town of Zakho.  That meant vehicles crossing the border were subject to three separate checks.  Eight members of Turkey's security forces and five Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants were killed in a clash early on Thursday near the border between northern Iraq and southeast Turkey, Turkish security and hospital sources said.  The PKK launched a separatist insurgency in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. REUTERS",en,terrorattack,173,['Iraq']

The jihadists are also alleged to have carried out mass abductions, used human shields, intentionally shelled homes, and targeted people trying to flee.  ""Those responsible must answer for their heinous crimes,"" said UN human rights chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein.  He also called for alleged violations by Iraqi forces to be investigated.  The UN says another 461 civilians died a result of Iraqi military and US-led coalition air strikes during the most intensive phase of the battle, which lasted from November 2016 to July 2017.  In total, at least 2,521 civilians were killed and another 1,673 were wounded during the military operation, mostly as a result of IS attacks, according to the report published on Thursday by UN Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  It says that early in November 2016, in areas of Mosul under IS control, members of the group used loudspeakers to announce that residents of areas retaken by Iraqi security forces were considered as ""legitimate targets"" because of their ""failure"" to fight troops.  ""This so-called 'fatwa' was accompanied by a sustained campaign of [IS] attacks on eastern Mosul that directly targeted civilians,"" the report adds. ""Tactics included shelling, use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and shooting fleeing civilians.""  ""During the course of the operation to retake Mosul City thousands of civilians were subjected to shocking human rights abuses and clear violations of international humanitarian law,"" Mr Zeid said.  ""The execution-style killing of civilians, the suffering inflicted on families, and the wanton destruction of property can never be tolerated in any armed conflict, and those responsible must answer for their heinous crimes.""  The report calls on the international community to take action to ensure that those responsible for ""international crimes"" such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are held accountable, and urges Iraq to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC).  It notes that Iraqi courts and tribunals do not have jurisdiction over international crimes, and that prosecutors police investigators ""lack capacity"" to investigate, charge and try people in relation to them.

In a 53-page report detailing atrocities in Mosul that amount to ""international crimes"", the United Nations said the executed civilians were among at least 2,521 who were killed during the battle for the city, mostly from ISIS attacks, including indiscriminate shelling and the use of improvised bombs and - increasingly - explosive-laden drones.  The report said the militants also carried out mass abductions of civilians, used thousands of civilians as shields in combat with Iraqi soldiers, and forcibly recruited boys as young as nine from families and then deployed them as ""Cubs of the Caliphate"" wearing explosive belts.  The report, produced by the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, could be used for war-crimes prosecutions.  ""During the course of the operation to retake Mosul city thousands of civilians were subjected to shocking human rights abuses and clear violations of international humanitarian law,"" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, said in releasing the report. ""Those responsible must answer for their heinous crimes,"" he said.  Among the report's recommendations was allowing the International Criminal Court jurisdiction to pursue justice for victims. The report also said the Iraqi government could amend the country's criminal code to grant domestic courts jurisdiction over international crimes.  Seized by ISIS fighters in 2014, Mosul was the militant group's biggest urban conquest, with a population of 1.5 million, part of a span of territory it held in Iraq and neighboring Syria.  With air support from the US military and help from other allies, Iraqi forces began to retake the city in October 2016 and declared victory in July.  But much of Mosul was heavily damaged, including its famed al-Nuri mosque, and vast parts remain littered with unexploded bombs and booby-traps left by fleeing ISIS fighters.  The report was based on testimony of victims, survivors and witnesses to atrocities. While some implicated Iraqi forces in extrajudicial killings or abuse, the report attributed the vast majority of violations to ISIS.  A section of the report on mass killings and summary executions by the ISIS described three instances in which civilians accused of collaborating with the government were executed.  On Nov 25, 2016, the report said, militants shot to death 27 civilians in Muhandiseen Park for leaking information. On Dec 2, militants killed a Mosul University student for having received cash from a friend outside the city. On Dec 17, they publicly beheaded two civilians in eastern Mosul suspected of having cooperated with Iraqi forces.  Another section of the report, on the ISIS' use of improvised explosives, included attacks with car bombs and weaponised drones.  On Nov 6, 2016, it said, an explosive-laden vehicle in eastern Mosul killed 35 civilians, including women and children. On Feb 3, a drone carrying explosives hit an eastern Mosul primary school, killing two women teachers. A week later, an explosive-laden drone targeted a funeral in northern Mosul, killing eight, including three women.  The report said ISIS' use of weaponised drones grew more frequent in the course of the battle for Mosul and ""represented a new tactic"".",en,terrorattack,177,['Mosul']

Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) fighters fire a cannon against Islamic State militants in Al-Qaim, Iraq November 3, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer  The losses on either side of the frontier appear to reduce the caliphate that once ruled over millions of people to a single Syrian border town, a village on a bank of the Euphrates in Iraq and some patches of nearby desert.  Officials on both sides of the border said its final defeat could come swiftly, although they still fear it will reconstitute as a guerrilla force, capable of waging attacks without territory to defend.  IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prime Minister Haidar Abadi announced that government forces had captured al-Qaim, the border town where the Euphrates spills from Syria into Iraq. That leaves just the village of Rawa further down river on the opposite bank still in the hands of the ultra-hardline militants, who swept through a third of Iraq in 2014.  On the Syrian side, government forces declared victory in Deir al-Zor, the last major city in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eastern desert where the militants still had a presence. Government forces are now about 40 km away from Albu Kamal, the Syrian town across the border from al-Qaim, and preparing for a final confrontation.  A U.S.-led international coalition which has been bombing Islamic State and supporting ground allies on both sides of the frontier said before the fall of al-Qaim that the militant group had just a few thousand fighters left, holed up in the two towns on either side of the border.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We do expect them now to try to flee, but we are cognisant of that and will do all we can to annihilate IS leaders,Ã¢â‚¬Â spokesman U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“As IS continues to be hunted into these smallest areas ... we see them fleeing into the desert and hiding there in an attempt to devolve back into an insurgent terrorist group,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dillon. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The idea of IS and the virtual caliphate, that will not be defeated in the near term. There is still going to be an IS threat.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the desert near the frontier.  BESIEGED IN ALL DIRECTIONS  Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) advance towards the city of Al-Qaim, Iraq November 3, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer  Driven this year from its two de facto capitals -- IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mosul and SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Raqqa -- Islamic State has been squeezed into an ever-shrinking pocket of desert straddling the frontier by enemies that include most regional states and global powers.  In Iraq, it faces the army and ShiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœite armed groups, backed both by the U.S.-led international coalition and by Iran. In Syria, the U.S.-led coalition supports an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias north and east of the Euphrates, while Iran and Russia support the government of President Bashar al-Assad.  On the Syrian side, FridayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government victory at Deir al-Zor, on the west bank of the Euphrates, ended a two month battle for control over the city, the centre of SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oil production.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some of them will fight until death, but they will not be able to do anything,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is besieged from all directions, there are no supplies, a collapse in morale, and therefore all the organisationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elements of strength are finished.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Once Albu Kamal falls, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Daesh will be an organisation that will cease to exist as a leadership structure,Ã¢â‚¬Â the military source said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It will be tantamount to a group of scattered individuals, it will no longer be an organisation with headquarters, with leadership places, with areas it controls.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In Iraq, Abadi congratulated his forces for capturing al-Qaim Ã¢â‚¬Å“in record timeÃ¢â‚¬Â only hours after commanders announced they had entered it. Earlier in the day, they seized the border checkpoint on the road to Albu Kamal in Syria.  IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s joint operations command said the only territory left to capture is Rawa, a small village on the opposite bank of the Euphrates.

The US military has hit ISIS ""much harder"" over the past two days after the terror group claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in New York City's Lower Manhattan borough that killed eight people and wounded a dozen more, Mr Trump said.  ""They will pay a big price for every attack on us!"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter.  ISIS claimed the attack in a statement issued in the group's weekly newsletter on Thursday, calling Tuesday's rampage ""one of the most prominent attacks targeting Crusaders in America"". It described the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, as a ""soldier of the caliphate"" and added that the attack was carried out in response to the group's call to target ""citizens of the Crusader countries involved in the alliance against the Islamic State (in Iraq and Syria)"".  It was an uncharacteristically late claim for a group that in the past year has typically issued its statements within the first 24 hours after an attack.  It was also not released through the ISIS Amaq News Agency, which is usually the first to carry such statements. And it marks a break with the usual pattern of not claiming responsibility for an attack when a suspect is in custody.  As the investigation continues, the federal authorities are increasingly focusing on a wedding in Florida two years ago attended by Saipov as a possible key to understanding whether he had personal ties to people connected to ISIS, law enforcement officials said.  A person at the wedding was under scrutiny by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as part of a terrorism investigation at the time, the officials said. Saipov's presence at the wedding brought him to the FBI's attention, though it did not prompt an investigation of him, law enforcement officials said.

The wedding was held in August 2015 in the clubhouse of a sprawling apartment complex in Fort Myers, Florida, that was the home of relatives of Saipov, according to a Muslim cleric whom Saipov invited to the celebration.  The groom was the brother-in-law of Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan. The bride was an Uzbek woman from Fort Myers, whose family lived in the apartment complex where the celebration was held.  The person at the wedding who was under an active FBI investigation would have been the subject of physical and electronic surveillance.  It is not clear if the FBI is still investigating that person.  Officials have also not named that person or said why they were investigating the person.  Federal investigators this week were pursuing another lead related to Saipov's friendships in Florida. They announced on Wednesday that they were trying to learn more about a second Uzbek man, Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, 32.  Later that day, they said they had found Mr Kadirov in New Jersey. They did not say why they were interested in him.  On Thursday, Mr Kadirov, through an intermediary, issued a statement denouncing the attack in New York. ""It is so sad and unbelievable,"" the statement read in part. ""It is not acceptable. We as Muslims completely reject this kind of actions. No human being who has a heart can do this.""  In New York on Thursday, the Transportation Department began placing hundreds of concrete barriers at 57 intersections along the Hudson River Park Bikeway.

The attack took place at a checkpoint outside the main security headquarters in Aden's Khor Maksar district, they said.  Sunday's bombing was heard across the city and a plume of smoke could be seen from miles away, residents said.  Clashes erupted in the area immediately, they said. It was unclear who was behind the attack or the clashes that followed.  The port city of Aden is the interim headquarters of Yemen's internationally recognised government, which had to move there when Houthi rebels took control of the capital, Sanaa, in 2015 during Yemen's civil war.  More than 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen's conflict since the Houthis advanced on Aden, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi him to flee and seek help from Saudi Arabia.  Aden is dominated by Yemeni forces backed by the United Arab Emirates, a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen's war to restore Hadi.  Saudi Arabia's air defence forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen over the capital, Riyadh, on Saturday, state news agencies reported.  The missile was brought down near King Khaled Airport on the northern outskirts of the city and did not cause any casualties.

A Saudi-led coalition meanwhile launched a wave of overnight airstrikes on the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, apparently in response to a ballistic missile fired by the rebels toward an international airport on the outskirts of Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia said it shot down the missile before it hit its target, with fragments landing in an uninhabited area north of the capital.  Speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, the security officials said the militants had taken an unknown number of people prisoner inside the compound in Aden. They said Shallal al-Shayae, the security chief, was not inside the compound at the time of the attack.  Witnesses said at least four militant snipers could be seen on the roof of the compound. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack or if they had made any demands. The complex attack bore the hallmarks of the country's powerful al-Qaida affiliate. Yemen is also home to an offshoot of the Islamic State group.  The country is embroiled in a war between Iran-backed Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and the internationally recognized government, which is allied with a Saudi-led military coalition. The government has been based in Saudi Arabia since the Houthis overran Sanaa in 2014. Government forces ostensibly control Aden, but the city remains volatile.  The Houthis said in a statement that the missile was launched in response to bombings that have killed civilians. The Houthis have fired a number of missiles across the border in recent years, but this was the first time one landed near a populated area, and it appeared to be the deepest strike yet within Saudi territory.  Riyadh is around 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) north of the border with Yemen.  Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen have killed and wounded thousands of civilians, hitting houses, busy markets, hospitals and schools in what rights groups have said amounts to war crimes. Houthi artillery has also killed large numbers of civilians.

The interior ministry said the attacks targeted a Shi'ite Muslim mosque on Atlas Street in central Kirkuk and gave an initial casualty toll of one killed and 16 wounded.  It is the first such attack since the central government in Baghdad seized the oil-rich city last month from Kurdish forces, who had been controlling Kirkuk for three years.  The central government in Baghdad launched an offensive on Oct. 16 to recapture the city and other territories in northern Iraq claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds, in retaliation for a referendum on Kurdish independence.  Iraqi security forces advanced on the city, forcing the Kurdish Peshmerga to withdraw. The retreat also allowed Baghdad to take control of all oil fields operated by the state-owned North Oil Company in Kirkuk's northern province.  No group has claimed responsibility for Sunday's attacks but the suicide bombings are a trademark of Islamic State militants.  Police sources said the two attacks happened in quick succession and said the death toll might rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition.  ""It's a crowded street and a place for street vendors. The terrorists wanted to kill large number of people,"" said a Kirkuk police major.  Iraqi security officials have said Islamic State is likely to wage an insurgency in Iraq after their self-proclaimed caliphate all but collapsed and they were dislodged from large territories in the west and north on the country.  Iraqi security forces have recaptured nearly all territories once controlled by Islamic State.

Sabahan Mohammad Amin Baco, 31, replaced Isnilon Hapilon, 51, who was killed as the five-months-long conflict between Philippine troops and Muslim militants for Marawi city in Mindanao, drew to a close.  ""Amin Baco is now the leader, not just of the remaining Maute but as emir of South-east Asia ISIS,"" Director-General Ronaldo de la Rosa told reporters, referring to the group that supplied the bulk of fighters who stormed Marawi on May 23.  Deputy Director-General Rolando Mendez said Baco is ""one of the most experienced terrorists"" in the Philippines, plotting attacks and providing combat training to local militants for years.  Baco was an operative of the Malaysia-based terror group Jemaah Islamiyah.  Intelligence sources said he was trained by fellow Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, alias Marwan, who was one of the world's most wanted terrorists when he was killed in a police raid two years ago.  Baco was staying near Marwan's remote hideout in Mamasapano town in Mindanao during the raid, but he eluded arrest, said Mr Mendez.  Security officials said Baco took part in the Marawi attack, but they could not ascertain whether he managed to flee or is leading dozens of stragglers still inside the city.  Mr De la Rosa said most of the new information about Baco was provided by Muhammad Ilham Syahputra, an Indonesian militant nabbed in Marawi last week.  Security expert Rommel Banlaoi said Baco presents a bigger threat than Hapilon or Mahmud Ahmad, a former Malaysian university lecturer who was Hapilon's No 2 but was also killed in Marawi.  Mahmud was regarded more as an ideologue and organiser than a battlefield commander.  Baco, on the other hand, has had a long experience in fighting a guerilla war. He is also adept at making bombs, a knowledge he has passed on to many recruits.  Besides Baco, security forces are also hunting for 42-year-old Malaysian municipal council worker Muhammad Joraimee Awang Raimee and an Indonesian known only as Qayyim.",en,terrorattack,,

The study in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases is the first comprehensive look at the impact of Group B Streptococcus infection (GBS), which is estimated to live harmlessly in the intestinal tracts of up to a third of all adults.  When a pregnant woman carries the bacteria, it can pass to her foetus via the amniotic fluid, or during birth as the infant passes through the vaginal canal.  Babies and foetuses are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight the multiplying bacteria.  If untreated, GBS can lead to meningitis and septicemia, which can be deadly. Babies that survive may develop cerebral palsy, or permanent sight and hearing problems.  There is no vaccine available to prevent GBS, although work is in progress to develop one.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The findings, led by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, estimated that out of 410,000 GBS cases every year, there will be at least 147,000 stillbirths and infant deaths globally.  The greatest burden was seen in Africa, which experiences 54 per cent of infections and 65 per cent of stillbirths and infant deaths from GBS, said the report, released at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting in Baltimore.  The top five countries where pregnant women are infected are India (2,466,500) China (1,934,900), Nigeria (1,060,000), the United States (942,800) and Indonesia (799,100), according to the report.  Researchers said the scale of the problem merits more urgency.  ""These disease burden estimates highlight the importance of perinatal infection prevention,"" said co-author Johan Vekemans, medical officer of the Initiative for Vaccine Research at the World Health Organization.  ""It is now essential to accelerate the GBS vaccine development activities. The technical feasibility is estimated to be high.""  If a vaccine is developed that is at least 80 per cent effective and reaches 90 per cent of women, it could potentially prevent 231,000 cases of infant and maternal GBS, said the report.  Currently, women with GBS are given antibiotics during labour to reduce the chance of it passing to their baby.  But there are problems with this approach, said co-author Joy Lawn, professor of maternal, reproductive and child health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  ""Antibiotics currently prevent an estimated 29,000 cases of early-onset Group B Streptococcal disease per year, almost all in high-income settings,"" she said.  ""However, this approach may be difficult in low-income settings where many births take place at home,"" she added.  ""In addition, giving antibiotics to 21.7 million women may contribute to antimicrobial resistance - a major global health crisis.""",en,diseas,,

991901,thestar,None,Egypt Western Desert attack exposes front outside Sinai - World,http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2017/11/07/egypt-western-desert-attack-exposes-front-outside-sinai/,7/11/2017 0:00,7/11/2017 22:45,"CAIRO (Reuters) - A deadly attack on the police in Egypt's Western Desert claimed by a new militant group risks opening up another front for security forces far beyond the remote northern Sinai, where they have battled a stubborn Islamic State insurgency since 2014.  A little-known group called Ansar al-Islam claimed responsibility for the Oct. 21 attack. Analysts and security sources said the heavy weapons and tactics employed indicated ties to Islamic State or more likely an al Qaeda brigade led by Hesham al-Ashmawy, a former Egyptian special forces officer turned jihadist.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has already suggested fighters from Islamic State will move into Egypt and neighbouring Libya now that the group in on the retreat in Iraq and Syria after a string of losses.  Security is key for Sisi, a former military commander who presents himself as a bulwark against Islamist militants, as he looks set to seek re-election next year.  Claims of a new front with possible ties to Ashmawy and al Qaeda would increase risks the security forces face in the Western Desert, where militants can already take advantage of the terrain and the porous Libyan border, security sources, analysts and residents say.  Two security sources and a medical source said evidence showed one militant killed in a follow-up raid was a former military officer and second-in-command to Ashmawy, whose allegiance switched from Islamic State in the Sinai to al Qaeda, and who has been based in Libya since 2014.  ""If he has been involved with what appears to have been a heavily armed and wholly unexpected operation on the Egyptian side of the Egypt-Libya border, that's of great concern,"" said H.A. Hellyer, an Egypt expert and senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.  An interior ministry official said he could neither confirm nor deny the validity of the Ansar al-Islam claim as it was being investigated. Prosecutors are also investigating the attack.  Two Homeland Security officers said militants in the Western Desert appeared more professional than in Sinai. The officers, who work on gathering intelligence, said militants tied to Ashmawy could draw on experience of members who once were in the Thunderbolt elite army unit, or former police.  ""Ashmawy and four other former officers have experience in fighting, surveillance, and planning so the group they have with them is dangerous,"" one officer said, referring to Ashmawy's brigade commanders.  START OF A CAMPAIGN?  It remains unclear exactly what happened when an Egyptian police convoy ran into an apparently well-planned ambush by a heavily armed militant group in a remote, desert area 135 km (85 miles) southwest of Cairo.  Three security sources told Reuters at the time that dozens of police officers and conscripts were killed. But the interior ministry refuted that figure the next day and said 16 police and conscripts died, including some high-ranking officers.  One part of the operation was hit by rockets and heavy weapons, officials and sources said. The lead and rear vehicles were hit first, immobilising the convoy, security sources said.  On Oct. 28, the interior ministry replaced several senior security officials in charge of the area where the attack happened, including a homeland security chief and a Giza province security chief, though no reason was given.  On Oct. 31, the army launched air strikes against the militants it said were responsible, killing dozens and rescuing a kidnapped and wounded policeman.  The new group gave no evidence of its Oct. 21 claim, and it said the oasis attack was the start of a campaign against Sisi's government. It gave a list of grievances but no evidence on the size of its operations or its abilities.  Ansar al-Islam's statement was carried by another group with al Qaeda links, Guardians of Sharia, whose social media feeds also carry statements from al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri.  Three security sources in the Giza area said they believe the attack may have been the work of Ashmawy's militants.  Egyptian authorities believe he fled to Libya in 2014. He has strong ties in the Libyan city of Derna, where he operates an al Qaeda cell with other former Egyptian officers.  He has been blamed for high-profile attacks such as the killing in June 2015 of Egypt's top public prosecutor in a car bomb. But moving into Egypt would also raise questions about whether he had shifted his area of operations.  Both Islamic State and al Qaeda have brigades operating in North Africa, where they have competed for space in Libya, especially in Derna, and sometimes operated alongside each other in small brigades in countries like Tunisia and Algeria.  Oded Berkowitz, an intelligence analyst for risk consulting group MAX Security, said assessing the new group's capabilities or loyalties was difficult, but there could be an effort by al Qaeda to benefit from Islamic State's decline to bolster its presence and recruits locally.  ""There is a strong al Qaeda presence in Libya that can support such an endeavour in Egypt. Usually, a militant group in decline (IS) and an increase in competition between two groups translates into a more aggressive stance, and attempts at larger and more quality attacks,"" he said.  SINAI TO NORTH  Egypt's security forces are battling several militant groups, but have been focussed on an Islamic State affiliate that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers in the northern Sinai and has now begun staging attacks outside the peninsula.  But the Western Desert, a vast region making up more than half of Egypt's territory, has always been a security headache with arms flowing across the frontier from Libya.  Militant groups have found shelter across the border in the chaos that followed the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.  Residents, businessmen and security sources around the area of the ambush say they have seen a heightened militant presence over the last two years, with militants sometimes openly driving along highways at night, and carrying out hit-and-run attacks.  ""It's closer for them to bring the weapons from Libya and it's closer for them to carry out their operations, then flee to Libya or hide out in the desert,"" said one Egyptian military intelligence officer working in Farafra Oasis area near the Oct. 21 attack.  Egypt's continuing struggle against Islamist insurgencies at home contrasts with Islamic State's big losses in Iraq and Syria. In Libya's southern Sahara, Islamic State shows signs of a revival after losing Sirte city a year ago.  U.S. forces carried out air strikes in Libya in September - the first for almost a year - to destroy an Islamic State camp.  When Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in September urged followers to stand fast after defeats in Iraq and Syria, he mentioned Sinai and Sirte as places where they should fight.  Islamic State, which some experts had suspected was involved, included details of the Oct. 21 attack in its Al-Nabaa news bulletin, but without any claim of responsibility.  The Western Desert attack came as Egypt hopes a peace agreement between Palestinian rivals Fatah and Hamas on the Gaza Strip across its Sinai border can help stabilise that area and curb supplies to militants on the peninsula.  ""Militants are able to move in the Western Desert easier than they do in Sinai, due to the open geographic nature,"" one police officer working in the area said. ""It's not like Sinai, which you can cordon off.""  (Editing by Giles Elgood)",en,terrorattack,,

The assault on Shamshad TV by militants disguised as policemen, which was claimed by the Islamic State (ISIS) group, highlights the risks facing journalists who are increasingly targets in the war-torn country.  After about 3 hours of fighting Afghan special forces overpowered the attackers, who were armed with guns and grenades, and freed staff trapped inside the building.  ""The attack has ended. According to the commander of the special forces all the staff who were inside the building have been rescued,"" Shamshad TV announced as it went back on the air.  A Shamshad news presenter, his hands bandaged after cutting himself on glass as he fled the attackers, told viewers that 20 colleagues had been wounded. Six were in a critical condition.  ""We have all come back (to work), all our journalists and colleagues are back on duty,"" he said.  Shamshad news director Abid Ehsas, interviewed by rival Tolo News at a hospital in the Afghan capital where some of his wounded colleagues were being treated, said: ""This is an attack on freedom of media but they cannot silence us.""  The station reported that one attacker blew himself up at the gate. Another went inside and shot at staff before going up to the roof to fire at security forces.  Special forces had to blast their way through a wall of the compound to enter the premises of the Pashto-language broadcaster.  ""I was in my office when gunmen wearing police uniforms attacked the building,"" Ehsas said.  ""They killed one of our guards and entered the building and started firing. Most of us were able to flee but some were wounded and some jumped out of the windows.""  He said the station had not received any threats before the attack.  Gunshots could be heard inside the building every few minutes during the assault as more and more security forces and emergency services swarmed the area.  An employee told Agence France-Presse he had seen 3 attackers entering the building on security cameras.  ""They first shot the guard and then entered the building. They started throwing grenades and firing,"" Shamshad TV reporter Faisal Zaland, who escaped through a back door, told Agence France-Presse.  Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said one employee had been killed and 24 people wounded, including four firefighters.  In a tweet the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AJSC) renewed its call for ""the government to take all preventive measures to protect"" the media Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sentiments echoed by Amnesty International.  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani pledged to take ""serious measures"" to protect journalists in a statement condemning the attack.  Media under attack  ISIS claimed responsibility for the assault in a statement released by their Amaq propaganda agency. The Taliban had earlier released a Twitter statement denying involvement.  Pashto is one of the official languages in Afghanistan and is spoken mainly in the south where the Taliban have a large presence.  The attack spotlighted the increasing dangers faced by media workers in Afghanistan as security worsens.  The country suffered its deadliest year on record for journalists in 2016, according to the AJSC, with at least 13 media workers killed. That made it the second most dangerous place for reporters in the world after Syria.  A Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul in January last year killed seven employees of popular TV channel Tolo, which is often critical of the insurgents, in what the militant group said was revenge for ""spreading propaganda"" against them.  It was the first major attack on an Afghan media organization since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001.  The first half of 2017 saw 10 Afghan journalists killed, the AJSC said in July.  Kabul has been rocked by a series of deadly attacks in recent weeks as the Taliban and Islamic State group step up offensives against security installations and mosques.  Security in the capital has been ramped up since a May 31 truck bomb exploded on the edge of the so-called ""Green Zone"", killing around 150 people and wounding 400 others.  That attack also caused extensive damage to 1TV, a private news channel near the bombing site. Like Shamshad on Tuesday, it managed to resume operations within a few hours.  Special truck scanners, barriers and permanent and mobile checkpoints have been rolled out across the city since the May bombing.  But a suicide bomber struck again in Kabul's heavily fortified diplomatic quarter last week, killing at least five people. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,192,['Kabul']

Islamic State has been all but destroyed over the past two years, remaining only in Albu Kamal in Syria, Rawa in Iraq, in a few neighboring villages and patches of desert, and some isolated pockets elsewhere.  At the height of its power in 2015, it ruled over an expanse of the two countries, eradicating their border, printing money, imposing draconian laws and plotting attacks across the world.  On Wednesday, the army and its allies surrounded Albu Kamal and started to enter it, the pro-Hezbollah al-Manar television said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, reported that Iraqi militias had crossed into Syria to join the assault, but they denied it.  Despite its losses, Islamic State still has a territorial presence in Libya and elsewhere, and many governments expect it to remain a threat even after it loses the caliphate it declared from Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.  It has already carried out a series of guerrilla operations in both Iraq and in Syria, and it has continued to inspire lone militants to attack civilian targets in the West.  In Syria, the end of major battle operations against Islamic State may only prefigure a new phase of the war, as the rival forces which have seized territory from the jihadists square off.  The Syrian army, alongside its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and other Shi'ite militias, and backed by Iran and Russia, have seized swathes of central and eastern Syria in an advance against Islamic State this year.  Russian official media have in recent weeks reported a surge of strategic bombing and cruise missile strikes on Islamic State targets in eastern Syria as the army advanced.  A U.S.-backed coalition has supported a rival campaign in Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that have pushed Islamic State from much of the country's north and east.  NEW PHASE  The Syrian government has sworn to recapture territory held by the SDF, including Islamic State's former capital Raqqa and oil and gas fields lying east of the Euphrates.  In areas controlled by the SDF in northern Syria, Kurdish-led groups have established autonomy, announcing elections and setting internal policies.  On Tuesday, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, described the U.S. forces aiding the SDF in Syria as illegal invaders. Washington has not spelled out how its military support for the SDF would evolve after Islamic State's defeat.  Shaaban also pointed, in a television interview, to the example of Iraq, where the government retaliated against an autonomous Kurdish region after it held an independence referendum.  Iraqi military officials say small groups of Islamic State militants are still entrenched in the town of Rawa and the border desert strip with Syria. Scattered villages near al-Qaim, close to Albu Kamal, are still under militant control in an area called Rummana.  The Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an alliance of militias, denied a report by the Observatory that it had crossed the Syrian border and was attacking Albu Kamal.  ""Our movements are carried out under orders from the commander in chief of the armed forces and our key objective is to liberate Iraq's territories from Daesh.

On Monday the top UN body called on Myanmar to rein in military operations that have pushed more than 600,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh since late August, sparking a dire humanitarian crisis.  The statement expressed Ã¢â‚¬Å“grave concernÃ¢â‚¬Â over rights violations such as killing, sexual violence and torching of homes and property, Ã¢â‚¬Å“including by the Myanmar security forcesÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Other UN agencies have previously described the army crackdown, which Myanmar says is targeting Rohingya rebels, as tantamount to ethnic cleansing.  Responding to the security council yesterday, the office of MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi said the statement Ã¢â‚¬Å“ignores the fact that the issues facing Myanmar and Bangladesh can only be resolved bilaterally, in an amicable manner, betÃ‚Â­Ã‚Â­ween two neighbouring statesÃ¢â‚¬Â.  The statement Ã¢â‚¬Å“could potentially and seriously harm the bilateral negotiations between the two countries which have been proceeding smoothly and expeditiouslyÃ¢â‚¬Â, it added.  After weeks of tension over the billowing crisis, Myanmar and Bangladesh have begun talks on how to repatriate the refugees who have been cramming into squalid camps in the border district of CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bazar.  The two sides have yet to finalise a deal, with Myanmar last week accusing Bangladesh of delaying the process, while a Dhaka official said it was Myanmar who was not ready.  The crisis has showered global censure on Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate once feted around the globe for her years-long struggle against the former junta.  While she lacks control over the military and security policy, the leader has been blasted for not using her moral authority to defend the Rohingya against an increasingly vocal strain of Islamophobia espoused by the Buddhist public.  The 72-year-old, who is also foreign minister, further inflamed the global community when her office vowed to block visas for a UN fact-finding mission to the conflict zone in northern Rakhine.  Diplomats said the UN security council statement, which fell short of a full resolution, was watered down to secure backing from Beijing.  Rights groups have accused the UN body of dragging its feet over the Rohingya crisis and called for sanctions against those involved in the atrocities.  The US, which is dispatching Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Myanmar on Nov 15, has said it is seeking a diplomatic solution to the crisis but has not ruled out sanctions.

ABU DHABI: The battle against Islamic State in the Levant is nearing its end, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday, but he left the door open to Paris engaging elsewhere to tackle Islamist militant groups if needed.  ""We have won the war in Raqqa, and the coming weeks ... will enable us to win completely on a military level in the Iraqi-Syrian zone,"" Macron said in a speech at a French military base in Abu Dhabi where he is on a two-day visit.  France has supplied weapons and training to local forces in Syria and Iraq, has special forces operating in the region and has been one of the main countries bombing militants as part of the U.S.-led coalition. In total, it has some 1,200 troops in its Levant operation.  ""This fight will not be finished. In the Gulf, passing through south-east Asia and the Sahel, there are lots of places where the military fight will continue,"" he said.  France's other main area of combat is West Africa, where it has some 4,000 soldiers as part of a counter-terrorism operation against al-Qaeda-backed militants and where there appears little prospect of Paris being able to disengage anytime soon.  Speaking to France 2 television, Macron appeared to go a step further by suggesting that France could be ready to act elsewhere across Africa if required.

""There will be theatres of operation in which our soldiers are present, such as in the Sahel, but there will undeniably be new battlegrounds against Islamic State, al-Qaeda or Boko Haram,"" he said.  Some analysts have warned that France's military is already overstretched, but politicians may find themselves in a position where it is difficult to refuse demands by some of its allies, especially the United States, to commit more troops in areas such as Afghanistan.

As the army gains ground, complaints are growing that both sides are committing atrocities against civilians.  The Associated Press recently spoke with eight rebel soldiers who had been on the front lines in a rebel-held area and all recounted similar events: government forces gang-raping women, burning houses with people inside and killing children.  Inconclusive peace talks were held in the capital, Juba in October. The negotiations are scheduled to resume in December and by that time opposition forces probably will have lost more territory, experts say.  In the last six months, despite President Salva Kiir's declaration of a unilateral cease-fire, government troops have captured large swaths of land previously held by rebel forces. What was once the opposition heartland, Upper Nile state, is now mostly under government control.  South Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands and forced more than two million people to flee the country, creating the largest displacement of civilians in Africa since the Rwanda genocide in 1994. Refugees, and some of the more than 200,000 people sheltering in United Nations-run camps across South Sudan, have recounted targeted killings and rapes by government troops.  In the Equatoria region, Amnesty International found many accounts of civilians being killed with ""reckless abandon"" by government forces and allied militia, according to a report issued in July.  South Sudan's army has denied the allegations, saying the opposition is spreading ""negative propaganda"" in order to portray them as ""butchers.""  ""This is what you'd expect from your opponent,"" said acting army spokesman Col. Santo Domic Chol. ""We don't kill women and children and we don't want to kill everybody in South Sudan.""  The government's purpose is to promote peace and have everyone, including the opposition, join in national reconciliation, Chol said.  The South Sudan government's campaign is pushing the rebels further into the bush rather than ""convincing them to give up arms,"" said Alan Boswell, conflict analyst for Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based group focusing on armed violence. ""The government hopes to dictate victory on its own terms rather than being forced into a political settlement with its opponents.""  With the dry season approaching and fighting expected to increase, rights groups are urging both sides to stop the attacks, including violence against civilians, said Jehanne Henry senior Africa researcher for Human Rights Watch.  ""Since the start of the conflict we have been documenting horrific attacks on civilians and it's high time government puts an end to these crimes and holds those responsible to account,"" Henry said.  Justin Nyuol, chairman of South Sudan's Human Rights Commission, agreed.  ""While it's true some government forces have committed atrocities, opposition fighters have committed atrocities as well, including in Equatoria or other areas where they control, Nyuol said.  ""There is an element of brutality and it's being carried out by all the parties to the conflict. ... When the war gets more intense the level of brutality goes up.""",en,terrorattack,,

""We were the 'cleaners' group. Cleaning means slitting the throats of those who belong to the other side and are hiding,"" the teenager from Raqqa, Syria, said.  ""A guy from my area was decapitated by [ISIL] because of me. People had their hands chopped off because of me.""  Since the start of the Syrian civil war, armed groups have been using child soldiers in combat. ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group, is thought to have recruited around 2,000 children. They are called ""ashbal al khilafa"", the ""lion cubs of the caliphate"".      Kasswara, who is now 16, fled ISIL, also known as ISIS, after being sexually assaulted and is currently living in Greece. He tells his story in Witness: Lion cubs of ISIL.  Like Kasswara, a number of former cubs have fled to Europe where they live in anonymity. And with ISIL swiftly losing ground in Iraq and Syria, more child soldiers are bound to leave their ranks, raising concerns about whether they will pose a future danger.  Mia Bloom is a professor at Georgia State University who is writing a book on children in ""terrorist"" organisations.  Ishmael Beah fought as a teenager in the Sierra Leone civil war in the 1990s and is now an author and UNICEF advocate for children affected by war.  This is their take on what should happen with ISIL's former child soldiers.  Mia Bloom: A lot depends on the ways in which the children became involved. There's a whole range on the spectrum from luring to outright coercion.  Some children in orphanages and hospitals in Syria and Iraq were just taken. Some were handed over by the parents. Some joined ISIL as a way to ensure that their families would get to keep their house, and would get an allowance and food.  We know that ISIL used techniques to draw children in. They would have these events and give away free candy.  Or they would march the cubs down the street in brand new uniforms so that the other children would admire them and aspire to be like them. The organisation made membership of the cubs to be a rare and desirable thing.  The children of foreign fighters had a different sort of access. There were different schools for them whose language of instruction might be English or French.  Ishmael Beah: ""I was not forced to become a child soldier as some of the other kids were.  The circumstances pushed me to go to a base of the Sierra Leonean army to enlist. I had lost my family, my home and everything I knew as a child.  The military was the safest place to go, to be protected from what was going on in the country.  In the army, there was no choice but to fight. If you didn't kill, you would get killed. You had to fight for ammunition, you had to fight for food. Killing became like breathing. You didn't even think about it.  If you just sit around all day and nothing is happening in your life, the war is more likely to haunt you Ishmael Beah  After more than two years, when I was nearly 16 years old, my lieutenant handed me over to UNICEF. At first, I wasn't happy at all. I had gotten accustomed to the war. The army had become my new family. It's all I knew and all I thought my life would be.  It took a while for that to change. I spent eight months at a re-integration centre. What made the difference is that the staff who worked at the centre looked at us just as children, not soldiers.  I was also given the opportunity to go to school and do something with myself. I discovered I had an intelligence that I could use for something else than war.  Eventually, I studied political science and did so many things I didn't think I was capable of doing. It fostered an environment where I could create new memories to compete with my trauma.  You can come from war, and you can recover, but if you just sit around all day and nothing is happening in your life, the war is more likely to haunt you.  The community was involved in our reintegration too. They had to learn to believe in us again. A former child soldier often creates the expectation that if you were once violent, you'll always be violent.  Bloom: There's always a risk of recidivism. This is true for adults and children. We did research in Pakistan into children who had been involved in the Taliban.  These children were brought to the educational level for their age. They were given vocational training so they could go on to have a job. And they were re-educated religiously because the Islam these kids had studied was completely corrupted.  There was also a lot of aftercare, where the communities embraced the children and brought them back in.  This approach was successful, and some of the children who had been involved with the Taliban became like normal children again. So there is a possibility of a happy ending.  Ostracisation might push them back over the edge Mia Bloom  If members of the family were part of the Taliban, recidivism was much higher. This is where the ISIL situation becomes problematic, because in many cases the parents willingly gave the children over to the cubs.  This counts especially for the foreign fighters, so the ones who are going back to Germany or France.  These children also have a higher risk of relapsing because of the stigma attached to the group.  Even if your parents took you when you were four years old, even if you didn't necessarily sympathise with the group, back in a European city you will be perceived as a foreign element, and that's very dangerous. The ostracization might push them back over the edge.  Beah: One of the problems for us going back into our communities was that people knew we had been given opportunities that they didn't receive.  In the UNICEF centre, we had running water; most people didn't have running water. We had two meals a day; most people did not have that.  So a lot of people thought to themselves: If you fight in a war and you kill people, foreigners will come and give you all these opportunities.  At the re-integration centre, we were constantly being attacked by the community. People would throw stones at our building and come running into our compound to start a fight with sticks and stones.  It was clearly coming from a sense of injustice.  This is why I believe a holistic approach to healing society is necessary. The child that didn't fight was affected by the war too, so they should not be treated differently.  Bloom: Young ISIL fighters returning to Europe puts a huge onus on these countries. Keep in mind that many of these countries already have problems with their Muslim communities when it comes to giving them access to jobs, education and good healthcare.  Imagine how perverse it would be if people who didn't join ISIL don't have access to good programmes and returning fighters get all these resources thrown at them. You're going to have a very absurd situation.  Beah: I joined the army when I was 13. As a child, you don't just go to the battlefield, pick up a gun and shoot another human being. You have to be brainwashed to some extent to believe that what you are doing has some merit.  When I was in the army, I really believed I was fighting the right fight. My family had been killed, and I was fighting to make sure that people wouldn't do this to other children. It appealed to some of us who had lost everything. We wanted someone to pay for what had happened to us.  Now, after the war, I see that this narrative was used by all the groups that would recruit children and I no longer believe in it. But in order to function as a child in that madness, I had to believe in something. I had to justify what I was doing in order to survive.  Bloom: For some children who have fought for ISIL, we could make the argument that they're brainwashed, or they're parroting what the adults say. But for the ones who were 16 or 17 when they joined, it's much harder to convince me that's the case.  I make a distinction between the children who were exposed to violence and children who participated - the ones with blood on their hands. It's going to be a much more challenging experience to re-integrate them.  They're all children, and they all have to be treated as such. But we cannot be so blind as to assume that just because they're a child, they're innocent.  Beah: Until anybody can show me a war that children under 18 started all on their own, I don't think any former child soldiers should be prosecuted.  What I would tell the children coming out of ISIL is that it's going to be very difficult. There's a lot of stigma that they are going to have to deal with. They should make sure they have a strong support network to fall back on. It's not easy; it's going to take some time, but it is possible.  * Not his real name",en,terrorattack,,

The source said Hariri ""isn't expressing himself freely"" with the Lebanese government and that his own political bloc -- which is usually aligned with Saudi interests -- had ""no idea what's going on.""  Speculation has swirled this week that Saudi Arabia is holding Hariri against his will after he said he was resigning in a televised address from the Saudi capital Riyadh, last Saturday.  The remarks are likely to further rattle officials in Riyadh, who have denied forcing Hariri to resign or placing him under house arrest. Hariri holds dual Lebanese-Saudi citizenship and has a residence in Riyadh.  Hariri's office said he had received the Italian and Russian ambassadors to Saudi Arabia in his Riyadh residence on Friday, after questions were raised over his whereabouts.  Hariri's sudden departure has plunged Lebanon into a political crisis and stoked fears of a conflict, either with Saudi Arabia, which is increasingly agitated by Iran's ascendancy in the region, or Israel, which shares Saudi's fears about Iran even if it does not support Riyadh in public.  Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia has a centuries-old rivalry with Shia-led Iran, and Lebanon is fast becoming the new setting for a proxy conflict between the two Middle Eastern powers.  Hariri's Future Movement party had earlier demanded its leader's safe return, saying it was ""necessary to restore consideration and respect"" to Lebanon.  Lebanese President Michel Aoun also demanded Hariri's return in a meeting with Saudi charge d'affaires Walid Bukhari on Friday, the official Lebanese National News Agency reported. ""The way in which Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned was unacceptable,"" he said. He added he would not accept Hariri's resignation until he returns.  Saudis and Hezbollah trade barbs  Hariri, a Saudi-backed Sunni, read his Saturday resignation remarks from notes. While he did not explicitly say who he thought was plotting to kill him, he denounced Iran for meddling in the affairs of Lebanon and several other Arab states.  He also pointed to Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed Shia militant group in Lebanon, whose political wing is the most powerful bloc in Lebanon's fractured coalition government.  Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, lambasted Riyadh for interfering in Lebanese politics on Friday and repeated accusations that Saudi officials had detained Hariri and put him under house arrest.  ""Saudi insulted all the Lebanese by forcing ... Hariri to resign and detaining him,"" Nasrallah said.  He also made the incendiary claim that Saudi Arabia had offered Israel billions of dollars to launch a war against Lebanon and Hezbollah.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir earlier this week called the allegations ""nonsense,"" and blamed Hezbollah for Hariri's resignation.  ""Hezbollah did by its actions. Hezbollah did by hijacking the political system in Lebanon. Hezbollah did by threatening political leaders. Hezbollah did through a series of assassinations that they committed of over the years,"" he said in the CNN interview Monday.  When asked of Hariri was free to leave, he responded: ""Of course, he is. He is in Saudi Arabia. He is a Lebanese-Saudi citizen.""  US diplomat meets Hariri  The political crisis in Lebanon comes against the backdrop of turmoil in Saudi Arabia.  On the same day that Hariri announced his resignation in Riyadh, Saudi authorities arrested dozens of royals, businessmen and senior government officials in what was described as an anti-corruption sweep. Critics of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman accuse him of using the sweep to consolidate his power in the country.  Houthi rebels who have taken over the Yemeni government in the capital, Sanaa, fired a ballistic missile toward an airport in Riyadh , which the Saudis were able to intercept. Saudi Foreign Minister al-Jubeir told CNN that the attempted attack was ""a act of war"" from Iran, which is accused of supporting and arming the Houthis.  JUST WATCHED Saudi Arabia: What's going on?

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he had spoken to Foreign Minister al-Jubeir, who assured him Thursday that Hariri had himself made the decided to resign.  Tillerson on Friday warned against foreign elements intervening in Lebanon's affairs, adding Hariri was ""a strong partner of the United States.""  ""The United States supports the stability of Lebanon and is opposed to any actions that could threaten that stability. There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state -- which must be recognized as the sole authority for security in Lebanon.  ""The United States cautions against any party, within or outside Lebanon, using Lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country.""  US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told journalists on Thursday that the US charge d'affaires to Saudi Arabia, Chris Henzel, had met Hariri on Wednesday.  When asked what conditions he was being held in, she said: ""I would have to refer you to the government of Saudi Arabia and also to Mr. Hariri's office.""  French President Emmanuel Macron made an unscheduled trip to Riyadh on Thursday night and met with Saudi officials.

Two Iraqi infantry divisions and Sunni tribal forces are carrying out the operation in Anbar province.  It is believed ISIL fighters are holding 10,000 civilians hostage in the town of Rawa.  Iraqi forces seized several villages from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS), on Saturday in an operation to retake Rawa, the operation's commander said.  Troops backed by paramilitaries recruited among the region's Sunni Arab tribes ""launched a major offensive to liberate Rumana and the Rawa area"", General Abdelamir Yarallah said.  He later said they had ""retaken Rumana and its bridge on the Euphrates"" along with 10 other villages.  Rumana is on the north side of the Euphrates just across from al-Qaim, while Rawa, a small town, lies downstream.

""The security forces are very confident that they can rout ISIL from one of their last remaining strongholds in Iraq.""  Final battleground  Rawa is the last town still held by ISIL, apart from Albu Kamal, just across the Syrian border.  The Euphrates Valley town and nearby villages were bypassed by government troops and allied paramilitaries when they retook the town of al-Qaim on the Syrian border last week.  Haider al-Abadi, Iraq's prime minister, said on Saturday the Rawa operation aims to ""clean open areas in the desert"" of western Iraq.  The recapture of Rawa would mark the final battleground defeat of the group in Iraq and the demise of the ""caliphate"" declared by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014 over large expanses of Iraq and Syria.  Syrian government forces and allied paramilitaries from Lebanon, Iraq and Iran overran Albu Kamal on Thursday but lost the town again just two days later after a series of ISIL attacks.  ""ISIL fully recaptured Albu Kamal, and regime forces and allied militia are now between one to two kilometres from the city limits,"" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said on Saturday.  Against this backdrop, Abadi said on Saturday that losses from the war against ISIL have cost Iraq $100bn so far.  ""Iraq has lost $100bn in the anti-Daesh war, but we have achieved success in three battles; namely liberating the land, maintaining Iraq's unity and standing up to the threats,"" Abadi said during a speech, using the Arabic name for ISIL.",en,terrorattack,,

Moderates need to develop counter-narratives and reclaim their place, says Leftwrite CentreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mohamed Imran Mohamed Taib.  SINGAPORE: The recent announcement of two foreign preachers Ismail Menk and Haslin Baharim being barred from entering Singapore has shone a spotlight on exclusivist teachings.  They were found to have contravened the code of ethics issued by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) that, among other things, stipulates that religious teachings must not Ã¢â‚¬Å“be prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious or racial groupsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ismail Menk had been said to preach Ã¢â‚¬Å“segregationist and divisive teachingsÃ¢â‚¬Â and had, for example, taught that it was the biggest sin and crime for a Muslim to wish a non-Muslim Merry Christmas or Happy Deepavali.  This focus on exclusivist teachings should not come as a surprise, given the increasing threat of terrorism in the region, and the rising number of terror attacks worldwide.  The challenge at hand demands serious attention at home. In June this year, the Singapore Terrorism Threat Assessment Report revealed that since 2015, 14 Singaporeans radicalised by the Islamic State had to be dealt with under the ISA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and more cases have been revealed since.  Given how fast radicalisation can spread, as radical materials are easily available online and threats to social cohesion can come from global developments, a slew of measures were put in place under SGSecure to build vigilance, cohesion and resilience among the population.  Advertisement  Advertisement  While the connection between exclusivist teachings and terrorism might not be obvious, it is clear that such teachings harm social relations, particularly in SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multi-ethnic and multi-religious context.    However, one must not conclude that exclusivist teachings will necessary lead to terrorism, although terror ideologies do contain exclusivist thought.  Ultimately, exclusivist teachings can stir social segregation, especially when these preach the avoidance of social mixing and interactions with other religious or racial groups. More dangerously, these can sow ill will, inter-group tensions and communal conflict, making society ripe for the picking by extreme elements.  Terrorism often find fertile grounds in such conflict situations, when social tensions are high.  Foreign preachers Ismail Menk (left) and Haslin Baharim have been banned from entering Singapore. (Screengrabs from YouTube)  CONFESSIONS OF A FORMER TERRORIST  This was a lesson observed from the strategy of terror groups. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every conflict is an opportunity,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Sofyan Tsauri, a former member of several terrorist organisations, from the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) to Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid and later on, Al Qaeda Serambi Mekah in Aceh.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is known as the doctrine of miftahul sira (conflict as the beginning),Ã¢â‚¬Â 41-year-old Tsauri explained, citing the radical text of Abu Bakr Naji, an Al Qaeda strategist.  Tsauri had been caught by the Indonesian anti-terror unit Densus 88 in Bekasi, Indonesia in 2010 and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, but was released in 2015 after rehabilitation.  I met him in a recent workshop on Jihad Kiyai Menangkal Radikalisme Beragama (the clericsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ struggle to repel religious radicalism) organised by the Centre for Pesantren Studies based in Bogor, Indonesia.  The centre cultivates moderate and peaceful Islam Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a tradition subscribed to by the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest Muslim organisation with a string of pesantren (Indonesian Islamic boarding schools) across the archipelagic nation.  The former extremist disavowed his former ways through rediscovering his traditional religious roots via the NU.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was the NU tradition that brought me back to reality,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  PATH TO RADICALISATION  TsauriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey into extremism is as interesting as his exit. It was the global Muslim condition that first drew him into Muslim activism Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including the Palestinian condition.  Like many youths who saw the issue as the WestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assault against Islam, and coupled with a sense of injury wrought by centuries of colonialism and imperial designs against the Muslim world, he wanted to do something about it.  But unfortunately, it was the extremist narrative that convinced him that there was some sort of a cosmic war being waged between Islam and the kuffar (infidels). This narrative was cultivated systematically through discourse within extremist circles.  The defeat of Islamic State in its de facto capital Raqqa may only be the start of a wider struggle by the US to contain any insurgency launched by the militant group and to stabilise the region. (File Photo: REUTERS/Stringer)  One such discourse prescribes the need for an Islamic state (daulah Islamiyah) to be realised through active resistance and destruction of the Indonesian state (daulah Indonesiyah). The latter is seen as a taghut (evil and polytheistic) system.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If we live in an unIslamic country,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we must display our resistance, such as by burning the (Indonesian) flag.Ã¢â‚¬Â  He showed me some printed Arabic materials from extremist ideologues within Salafi circles who formulated a Ã¢â‚¬Å“theology of struggle (for death)Ã¢â‚¬Â. They called for the supremacy of Islam to be displayed against evil forces, including the West, Jewish and Christian agents in particular.  The takfiri framework dominates these texts.  Takfir is a Salafi concept of excommunication against those who disagree or depart from a puritanical and strict notion of what Islam is and should be. Extreme Salafists divide the world into two: Islamic versus unIslamic, the latter fashioned as anti-Islam. It is this binary thinking that makes up the Salafi worldview.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The takfiri attitude permeates our everyday life,Ã¢â‚¬Â Tsauri recalled.  Even when he was in prison, he would question the halal status of the chicken served occasionally to inmates. He was obsessed with purity and saw what went into the body to be just as important as what went on in the Muslim world.  More than a fear of contamination, however, it was the belief that the enemies of Islam were always finding subtle ways of weakening and undermining the faith of Muslims that put him on guard.  Call it a conspiracy theory, but to him, it was a very real everyday concern which led him and others to distance and isolate themselves from wider society. They eventually carved their own segregated space in study circles in several mosques. Any imam who did not share their worldview was shunned.  Through daily indoctrination, it was not long before Tsauri became a full-fledged member of a terrorist cell that sought violence as a way of achieving their ideological project of establishing an Islamic state.  It was the Nahdlatul Ulama's tradition that brought me back to reality,Ã¢â‚¬Â Tsauri shared. (Photo: AFP/Adek Berry)  FORMULATING AN EXTREMIST THEOLOGY  But operating within Indonesian society was not easy, especially in times of peace where it was difficult to mobilise masses to take up the struggle against the purported Ã¢â‚¬Å“enemies of IslamÃ¢â‚¬Â.  The window of opportunity appeared in 2009 when the Acehnese governor refused to implement the Syariah law in totality.  It was then that Abu Bakar Bashir, the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, contacted Osama bin Laden to seek consent to launch jihad in Aceh. Aceh was eventually declared a qaidah aminah or a Ã¢â‚¬Å“safe baseÃ¢â‚¬Â where takfiri ideas were to be disseminated.  Aceh was also selected because it was a convenient location for jihad with easy access to weapons. And Tsauri was responsible for the acquisition of weapons through the black market.  By then, the use of social media was on the rise, exploited by the leaders of Al Qaeda. By 2013, Indonesian members of Al Qaeda were debating online on the need to move the focus from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“far-away enemyÃ¢â‚¬Â (the United States) to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“near enemyÃ¢â‚¬Â (local governments).  This was part of wider debates within the central command of Al Qaeda in Iraq, which led to the emergence of a splinter group Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now known as the Islamic State Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who were shifting the battle territorially to Asia.    The theological basis of the focus was slowly formulated, in chat groups and online platforms, as members of the Al Qaeda in Aceh began adopting four positions: First, that ignorance was not an excuse not to be declared an infidel.  Second, a charge of apostasy should be brought against specific individuals or groups such as the police and military in Indonesia who were seen as defenders of evil.  Third, whoever did not call out or doubted the apostasy of a person was himself an apostate.  Fourth, those that practiced bidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ah (religious innovations) or evil acts were automatically considered apostates.  These formulations were derived from the fatawa (legal rulings) issued by second-generation Salafi clerics based in Saudi Arabia. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They form the modern concept of takfir that is at the root of extremist theological thought,Ã¢â‚¬Â Tsauri said.  An image taken from a propaganda video by the Islamic State group's media outlet. The group has leveraged social media to spread its message. (Photo: AFP)  The concept of takfir has proven to be useful to terrorist groups. It widens the notion of kufr (disbelief) to include every Muslim who resides in a country that does not implement the totality of Syariah and does not fight for it.  In the text Inilah Aqidah Kami, Daulah Islamiyyah (This is Our Creed, An Islamic State), Mustaqim alias Abu Yusuf declared Indonesia to be a territory of the infidels who must be fought for.  Such formulations give terrorists a reason to launch jihad against fellow Muslims because these Muslims are not considered ""true Muslims"" because of their acceptance of syirk (polytheism) and bidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ah (wrongful innovations in religion).    These Muslims are also considered legitimate enemies because their lack of will to join the struggle against the enemies of Islam makes them complicit and implicates them as individuals no different from the infidels.  Unsurprisingly, Muslims remain the biggest casualty in terrorist acts. All this reveals a deep sectarian dimension to the present problem of terrorism.  A LESSON FOR US  TsauriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confessions reveal a first important lesson: Amidst the volatile geopolitical conditions, providing safe platforms for discussion and sense-making are necessary.  Just as how the Palestinian conflict has been exploited by extremists to serve their own agenda of inciting a religious war between the West and Islam, so has IS exploited ignorance over issues of the caliphate, conflict in the Middle East and underdevelopment in the Muslim world in general.    Dialogue needs to be open and frank to curb and prevent the exploitation of misunderstanding and ignorance by extremist groups. (Photo: MUIS)  Second, people, particularly youths, must be equipped with ways to deal with rapid social change through constant dialogue so that they can navigate through their challenges.  Extremists often adopt a binary view of things and offer certainty in all matters, whereas issues are often complex, requiring constant negotiation.    Providing space for the negotiation of ideas amid diversity, and over controversial and sensitive issues, may be key. Not allowing active discussions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no matter how contentious these may be Ã¢â‚¬â€œ would give extremists the monopoly to provide answers that people seek.  That would be dangerous, given the propensity of extremist narratives to provide simplistic answers (for example, that the Muslim worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems are due to Ã¢â‚¬Å“anti-Islam forcesÃ¢â‚¬Â or that we are living in end times that require our loyalty to GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army to defeat the dajjal or false messiah).  This is also the context to why radicalisation is now occurring rapidly online. Without avenues to discuss and engage in contentious issues, many youths in particular turn to the internet to seek answers; and many online platforms are now dominated by extremist views.  Youth engagement is necessary in the fight against terror. (Photo: Ngau Kai Yan)  Third, we must not underestimate the power of ideology, which takes the form of religious theological thought. The modern doctrine of takfir Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as a concept and a practice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is one such example. Providing counter-narratives, therefore, is as important as understanding the sociopolitical context that allows such ideas to thrive.  But counter-narrators must take a leaf from their extremist counterpartsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ playbook and learn how to package and sell good ideas while helping people work through issues, and understand the psychology of their audience.  The battle is no longer in public face-to-face interactions, but increasingly, in the online sphere.  Last but not least, maintaining social cohesion in the present climate of terrorism is critical. But this is not an easy task. Early intervention through proscribing exclusivist and segregationist teachings are needed in the upstream battle against extremist ideologies.  More can be done. Beyond general awareness, various sectors of society must come together to strengthen relations that can provide a bulwark against attempts to sow tensions and conflict.  This is our only hope when a real crisis hits home.  Mohamed Imran Mohamed Taib is an interfaith activist and founding member of Leftwrite Centre.

The nine Disneyland cases are among 12 total cases of the bacterial lung infection that the Orange County Health Care Agency is investigating.  The patients, ranging in age from 52 to 94, lived in or had travelled to Anaheim, where the theme park is based, and nine had visited Disneyland in September.  One patient ""with additional health issues"", who had not visited the park, has died, health officials said.  There have been no new cases of the disease linked to Anaheim since September.  Disneyland was informed of the cases on 27 October.  Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, confirmed that two cooling towers had been shut down and treated with chemicals.  They will remain offline until tests confirm they are free from contamination.  The cooling towers provide cold water for various uses at Disneyland, such as refrigeration but not for drinking water, and give off a vapour or mist that could have carried the Legionnella bacteria.  Ms Hymel said that health officials had assured the company that there was no longer any risk to guests or employees of the park.  Legionnaires' disease can be spread through inhaling droplets from contaminated water sources.  While many people have no symptoms, it can cause serious pneumonia and prove dangerous to those with lung or immune system problems.

The government official told Al Jazeera that the kingdom feared for President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's life, and ""urged"" the 72-year-old to avoid returning to Yemen's coastal city of Aden.  The official also rubbished media reports from earlier this week that claimed Hadi was being held under house arrest in Riyadh.  ""Claims that Hadi is under house arrest are complete rubbish,"" the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.  ""Hadi can go anywhere he wants, he can even travel abroad, but from what I understand there is a real risk to his life should he return to Aden.""  Hadi and much of his government have been based in Riyadh since 2015 when Houthi rebels, in cooperation with troops loyal to Hadi's predecessor, former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, captured large expanses of the country, including the capital Sanaa.  ""There are forces there that would like to see him targeted, and that's why the Saudis don't feel it's right for him to come back. They have urged him to stay in Riyadh until the security situation improves,"" the official added.  The official did not say which forces wanted to ""target"" Hadi, but large parts of the south and south east are under the control of the United Arab Emirates and militias backed by Abu Dhabi.  The comments come just days after several international news organisations reported that Hadi, along with his sons, aides and military officials - who haven't visited Yemen since February - had been placed under house arrest.  ""When Hadi asks to go, they [Saudi Arabia] respond it's not safe for him to return as there are plotters who want to take his life and [the] Saudis fear for his life,"" an official was quoted as saying.  Deeply unpopular  Hadi became Yemen's president in 2012 under a US-backed deal that saw Ali Abdullah Saleh step down from power after a year of protests left over 2,000 people dead.  He was supposed to serve a two-year term but repeatedly postponed elections as negotiations over a new constitution through a National Dialogue Conference failed.  But it was his decision to cut fuel subsides in the summer of 2014 that sparked angry protests and forced thousands onto the capital's streets.  The Houthis exploited the unrest and marched south from their stronghold of Saada province to Sanaa, before surrounding the presidential palace - rendering Hadi powerless.  After escaping house arrest, Hadi fled the capital to Aden before seeking sanctuary in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.  But even before the turmoil, Hadi was deeply unpopular among many Yemenis.  Having served for almost 18 years as vice president in Saleh's government, his failure to dismantle a complicated network of alliances Saleh set up between the country's military, civil and tribal groups, drew anger from some of the country's biggest tribes.  'Zero personality'  ""Hadi's faltering popularity goes hand-in-hand with the UAE's growing power in south Yemen,"" Murad Alazzany, a Yemeni political analyst and professor at Sanaa University, told Al Jazeera.  ""His failure to return to Yemen underscores his loss of authority - even in the south that is nominally under his administration.  ""Yemen is incredibly polarised, and he's to blame for this. He's failed to offer a practical political settlement and doesn't possess the personality or any of the necessary skills to rally the people, and let's not forget - he has zero legitimacy.  ""He has also failed to gain any public support in the north, and this is mirrored in the south. Very few southerners, and even fewer people who believe in secession, support him,"" Alazzany added.  The UAE entered Yemen's war in March 2015 as part of a Saudi-led coalition to restore Hadi's ""legitimate"" government.  But in the last two years, it has trained, financed and armed militias in Yemen that only answer to it, set up prisons, and created a security establishment parallel to Hadi's government. Those groups answer to Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of South Yemen's secessionist movement.  Reports by rights groups have also found that the UAE has funded and directed a 'Security Belt' - a force created in 2016 that has been responsible for arbitrarily detaining and abducting people.  Welcome/not welcome?  ""Hadi is not welcome in Yemen,"" Ahmed al-Sharabi, a 40-year-old maths teacher in the capital, told Al Jazeera.  ""He should never return. He's responsible for several crimes and is one of the main people to blame for the the high number of civilian casualties since the start of the war.""  Since March 2015, fighting has killed more than 10,000 people and left over seven million in need of food assistance. Millions of others do not have adequate access to health, water and sanitation services.  Azzubair Abdullah Hasan, a physician treating cholera victims in the city's Aljiraf district, told Al Jazeera that Hadi could still be accepted if he ""ended the war.""  ""If Hadi can do the impossible and bring and end to this war, then yes.""  ""But right now, the people are more concerned about welfare than politics. Anyone who can feed them and take care of them will be welcomed.""  Despite being at war for more than two years, the coalition has failed to achieve its stated aims as Houthi rebels continue to hold the capital Sanaa and large parts of the country's north.  -Al Jazeera",en,terrorattack,,

Around 300 Kosovars have gone to Syria and Iraq since 2012 to fight with the Islamic State group for the establishment of a caliphate ruled by Islamic law. Some 70 have been killed but many, including women and children, are still believed to be in the conflict zone, despite the group's expulsion from almost all the population centres it had held.  The document, ""State Strategy Against Terrorism and Action Plan 2018-2022"", was posted on a government website on Friday. It said potential threats included ""attacks by members of terrorist organisations through foreign terrorist fighters, inactive cells, but also by sympathisers and supporters who may be inspired to commit violent acts"".  International and local security agencies have previously warned of the risk posed by returning fighters, and in 2015, Kosovo adopted a law making fighting in foreign conflicts punishable by up to 15 years in jail.  The report said there had been ""public calls for terrorist attacks in Kosovo and the region"" and called terrorism ""one of the biggest threats to national security"".

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was bound for Myanmar on Wednesday for talks with the army chief whose forces have been accused of atrocities against ethnic Muslim Rohingya during an operation that drove more than 600,000 to flee to Bangladesh.  NAYPYITAW: U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on Wednesday for a credible investigation into reports of human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims committed by Myanmar's security forces after a meeting with it civilian and military leaders.  More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military counter-insurgency clearance operation in Buddhist-majority Myanmar's Rakhine State that a top U.N. official has described as a textbook case of ""ethnic cleansing"".  ""WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re deeply concerned by credible reports of wide-spread atrocities committed by MyanmarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security forces and by vigilantes who were unrestrained by the security forces during the recent violence in Rakhine State,"" Tillerson told a joint news conference with Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of a civilian administration that is less than two years old and shares power with the military.  ""WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also distressed by the fact that hundreds of thousands, many women and children have been forced to flee to Bangladesh.""  Tillerson called for a credible and impartial investigation and said those who committed abuses should be held responsible.  He earlier held talks with the commander of Myanmar's armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is incumbent upon the military and security forces to respect these commitments of the civilian government; to assist the government in implementing them and to ensure the safety and security of all people in Rakhine state,"" Tillerson said.  In posting on his Facebook page, Myanmar's military supremo said he had explained to Tillerson the ""true situation in Rakhine"", the reasons why Muslims fled, how the military was working with the government to deliver aid and the progress made for a repatriation process to be agreed with Bangladesh.  The Myanmar military launched its clearance operation in Rakhine after an army base and 30 police posts were attacked on Aug. 25 by Rohingya militants, killing about a dozen members of the security forces.  Tillerson condemned the attacks on Myanmar security forces.  'STAGGERING'  A senior U.N. official levelled accusations of mass rape, killings and torture against the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, after a tour of refugee camps in the Cox's Bazar region of neighbouring Bangladesh.  Human rights groups have branded as a ""whitewash"" an internal military investigation, after its findings were posted on the army chief's Facebook page this week.  Back in Washington, U.S. senators are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests.  Tillerson said he would advise against any broad-based sanctions against Myanmar, as the United States wanted to see it succeed.  But he said if there was credible and reliable information on abuses by individuals they could be targeted by sanctions.  Myanmar is undergoing a transition to democracy after decades of rule by the military, but the generals retain extensive powers over security and a veto over reform of a constitution that has barred Suu Kyi from the presidency.  Tillerson said the United States would provide an additional US$47 million in humanitarian assistance for refugees bringing the total to US$87 million since the crisis erupted in August.  ""The humanitarian scale of this crisis is staggering. Over 600,000 Rohingya, mostly women and children have fled to Bangladesh and an unknown number from multiple ethnic groups remain internally displaced with limited access to food, water and shelter,"" Tillerson said.

1066130,bbci,None,Zimbabwe latest: How can you tell if a coup is happening?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-41981388,,16/11/2017 0:38,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday  Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been detained by the country's military, who have seized control of the national broadcaster, ZBC.  Soldiers and army vehicles are on the streets of the capital, Harare, where gunfire and artillery were heard on Wednesday.  Is it a coup? The military insists not - but it certainly has a lot of the hallmarks.  The signs that a coup is under way have always been the same across the world and across the decades. Here are the key things to watch out for when a takeover is on the cards.  1. Nobody ever says it's a coup  Firstly, be aware that almost nobody mounting a coup ever says that's what they're doing.  Zimbabwe's envoy to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, explicitly said there was no coup as the government was ""intact"" with no ""military takeover"".  ""We are only targeting criminals around [President Mugabe] who are... causing social and economic suffering,"" Mr Moyo said on state TV. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.""  The ""situation"" probably looks more alarming to those on the wrong side of the military action, however.  This kind of semantic wriggling is common in attempted coups.  In restive Venezuela, which has seen violent anti-government protests since the spring, military officers launched an unsuccessful uprising against President Nicolas Maduro in August.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Venezuela's rebel Army officers called their move ""a legitimate rebellion""  ""This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order,"" said the group's leader, Juan Caguaripano.  Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party disagreed, and deputy leader Diosdado Cabello branded it a ""terrorist attack"" on Twitter.  2. Where's the head of state?  When checking for a likely coup, look at where the head of state is. President Mugabe is being held in Harare under house arrest, according to the office of South Africa's President Jacob Zuma. He reportedly said in a phone call that he was fine.  There is no confirmation of the fate of his powerful wife, 52-year-old Grace Mugabe, who has been vying to be her husband's successor. However, an MP from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, Eddie Cross, told the BBC she had fled Zimbabwe for Namibia on Tuesday night.  Detaining the target of the uprising is a vital stage in proceedings. As the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus observes, the failure of Turkey's attempted coup in July 2016 stemmed from the plotters' inability to immobilise President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Foreign embassies can become a place of refuge for ousted or imperilled leaders. When President George Bush Senior invaded Panama in 1989, repressive strongman General Manuel Noriega holed himself up in the Vatican's embassy in Panama City.  Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption When US troops rolled into Panama, General Manuel Noriega made for the Vatican embassy  And sometimes, the head of state will show up in an entirely different country. In Honduras in 2009, troops deposed President Manuel Zelaya and forced him onto a plane. When he arrived in Costa Rica, he said he had been kidnapped in his pyjamas.  Almost three months later he made a surprise return - and installed himself in Honduras's Brazilian embassy.  3. People (and gunfire) on the streets  Waves of popular protest are a key coup signifier. Protesters will often call for a return to democracy and the fall of a repressive regime, only for the military to move in and take power.  In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak was forced out by mass protests during the Arab Spring of 2010-11, which also swept across Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Syria. The turning point came when the Egyptian army announced that it would not use force against the demonstrating crowds. Mr Mubarak stood down, and a military administration stepped into the breach.  Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Egyptian anti-government demonstrators shout slogans against President Hosni Mubarak at Cairo's Tahrir Square on February 10, 2011  As Turkey's failed coup unfolded in July 2016, civilians actually took to the streets in support of the threatened president. When bridges over the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul were blocked by renegade troops, the public joined pro-Erdogan soldiers to confront them.  There has been a lack of public protest in Zimbabwe, where tensions were triggered by Mr Mugabe sacking his political deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in favour of his wife, Grace. The streets are said to be calm, but armoured military vehicles are patrolling the capital.  4. Foreign powers warn their nationals  Even if not sheltering an endangered leader, embassies on the ground have a duty to keep their nationals safe, so they'll start offering guidance.  In Zimbabwe, the UK Foreign Office has advised Britons ""currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their accommodation until the situation becomes clearer"".  The US embassy tweeted that it would be closed on Wednesday ""due to ongoing uncertainty"".  5. State media seized  Getting the message out is important, so rebels often try to seize state or private media to use as their mouthpiece.  In Zimbabwe, the military has successfully overrun the headquarters of the state TV station, ZBC.  Taking to the airwaves is no guarantee of success, however.  In Turkey in 2016, the doomed army faction used a state broadcaster to claim it had seized power to protect democracy from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In fact, the revolt was suppressed.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Taking over state media didn't guarantee success for the coup against Turkey's President Erdogan  Zambia in 1997 saw an even less successful effort, with an attempted coup that lasted just three hours. At 6 one morning, a man calling himself Captain Solo announced on state radio that he had taken over the country, that the heads of the army and police were dismissed, and that President Frederick Chiluba had until 9am to surrender or be killed. But at 10am the president went on air to say six people had been arrested, and thanked his troops for ""a job well done"".  6. Borders, bridges and airports close  To impose control over a country - or even just its capital city - it helps to close the borders, and seal bridges and other infrastructure that allow people in and out.  In September 2015, presidential guards who led a coup in Burkina Faso ordered the sealing of land and air borders, as well as a night-time curfew.  Perhaps the most striking lesson in airport control comes from Pakistan in 1999, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to sack powerful army chief General Pervez Musharraf, and a battle for supremacy began.  Gen Musharraf was in Sri Lanka when he got word that Mr Sharif planned to move against him, and made an airborne dash from Colombo airport to Karachi. Air traffic control refused permission for the plane and its 200 passengers to land, and the pilot was ordered to divert it, first to Oman, then to India.  The general ordered the pilot to keep circling Karachi, even though fuel was running dangerously low. The plane was brought safely down only when pro-Musharraf soldiers surrounded the airport's control tower. The general was whisked to safety, and claimed control of Pakistan hours later.",en,terrorattack,203,['Zimbabwe']

The army estimated that 2,000 villagers had been displaced by several days of operations in a region straddling two provinces on the island of Mindanao, as the army went after the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), a small and splintered rebel group inspired by ISIS.  The latest operation follows the end last month of what was the Philippines' biggest battle since World War Two, in which troops took five months to crush an alliance of ISIS loyalists, including BIFF fighters, in Marawi City.  The occupation of the city by the militants and their dogged resistance spread alarm in the region about the rise of extremism and radical aspirations to create an ISIS caliphate.  Captain Nap Alcarioto, spokesman for the 6th Infantry Division, said troops were shelling BIFF gunmen in support of ground attacks in an area of marshland between the provinces of Maguindanao and Cotobato, about 170km from Marawi.  ""We are still awaiting results of operations,"" he said.  The army said it was fighting a BIFF faction led by Abu Toraypie, a man allied with the Maute group, the biggest militant group in an alliance that led the Marawi conflict.  Toraypie and some of his men had escaped from Marawi and the army was trying to prevent them from regrouping, the army said.  Military aircraft dropped bombs on another BIFF wing in a town close by.  The BIFF broke away from the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) a decade ago after becoming disillusioned with a protracted process with the government to grant autonomy to what is the mainly Catholic country's only predominantly Muslim region.  Separately, army spokesman Major General Restituto Padilla said Marawi was clear of militants who had been hiding in the ruins of the pummelled city, but unexploded munitions and booby traps had yet to be cleared.  ""The last firefight we had was on Nov 5, when we killed nine terrorists,"" he told a news conference, adding that all top militant leaders had been killed, although this was subject to DNA confirmation.",en,terrorattack,209,"['Top', 'Top', 'Top']"

It was August 4, and the young father was fleeing the main battle zone in Marawi, a city on the southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines, where, for three months, he was held hostage by Maute fighters linked to ISIL.  A bloody battle between the fighters and government forces was raging in Marawi since May, pushing thousands of residents to flee.  ""I was crying all the time. There was always a gun pointed at me,"" Diego, who used a pseudonym for fear of retribution, told Al Jazeera.  ""I lost count how many times they shot at me and beat me.""  Diego thought his ordeal was over when, after swimming for two straight hours, military officers found him on the other side of the city.  Instead, however, he was brought to a university campus where he said he was blindfolded and shackled.  For the next week, Diego said he endured physical, mental and emotional torture at the hands of security officers, whom he said were trying to make sure he was a hostage and not one of the Maute fighters himself.  ""They taunted me, saying 'Let's just kill him.' I could hear them electrocuting the guy next to me. They beat me up, thinking I would admit I was a fighter,"" he said.  War crimes  Diego's story has now been corroborated by a new report by human rights group Amnesty International, issued nearly four weeks after Philippine authorities declared total victory over the Maute fighters in Marawi.  The report, released on Friday and titled ""The Battle of Marawi: Death and Destruction in the Philippines"", describes widespread abuses committed by both Maute fighters and government forces - some of which amount to war crimes.  Based on interviews with 48 survivors and witnesses, as well as local leaders, journalists and activists, the report found that pro-ISIL fighters engaged in unlawful killings and hostage-taking, while government forces mistreated people in their custody.  Government shelling has caused widespread destruction in the city, civilians have been trapped in the crossfire and all parties to the conflict have engaged in looting, Amnesty found.  The group said it had ""documented a variety of serious violations of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict"".  ""Some of these violations amount to war crimes,"" it added.  'Extrajudicial killings'  On May 23, Maute fighters launched an attack on Marawi, the largest Muslim city in the predominantly Catholic nation, targeting Christians or anyone who could not recite the Shahada, the profession of the Muslim faith.  {articleGUID}  They took their victims hostage or killed them on the spot, shooting them with pistols or rifles, or slitting their throats, Amnesty found.  The report documented at least 25 of these ""extrajudicial killings"".  For the hostages, it was a daily struggle to survive torture and abuse at the hands of their Maute captors, Amnesty stated.  They foraged for food, retrieved and buried dead bodies, dug foxholes for the attackers, and made improvised bombs.  The men were forced to fight government forces while the women were used as ""sex slaves,"" the report found.  Many hostages attempted to escape, but those who were caught were either shot or beheaded by the fighters, Amnesty said.  'At least you are alive'  Hostages who successfully fled their captors, like Diego, often had to deal with government forces, who were suspicious of their potential links to the Maute fighters, the report found.  Several survivors recounted being shot at, beaten up and tortured by members of the Philippine Marines in an effort to get them to confess that they were members of ISIL, Amnesty reported.  One man said he was doused in hot liquid.  After two weeks in torturous detention, a survivor told Amnesty that a police investigator apologised for what he went through, telling him: ""At least you are alive. Don't complain"".  Witnesses said at least 10 hostages were also killed in a government air raid.  The government said more than 1,000 people - 920 Maute fighters, 165 soldiers and police, and 47 civilians - were killed in the fighting. It also said it had rescued 1,780 hostages.  According to Amnesty, however, the government's tally of civilian casualties may be incomplete.  Military investigating  The report questioned whether civilian deaths and the ""large-scale destruction"" of the city in government air and ground attacks were ""militarily necessary and proportional to the threat posed"" by the fighters.  The fact that bombings were carried out after the military said only a few Maute fighters were still alive casts doubt on whether the operations met the requirements under international humanitarian law, the report stated.  Police and military officers were among those who looted and ransacked homes and shops left behind by fleeing residents, according to witnesses quoted in the report.  Government forces are held to a higher standard than the armed group they were fighting, said Kathline Tolosa, of the Security Reform Initiative, a Manila-based watchdog.  ""The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is the protector of the people and the state Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ That is why we hold them to account,"" Tolosa said.  Restituto Padilla, a spokesperson for the AFP, acknowledged the ""allegations"" levied in Amnesty's report, but said the armed forces were still investigating.  ""Our actions in the Marawi conflict were guided by the rules of conflict, which provides for the necessity and proportionality in the use of force,"" Padilla said.  ""We also understand the manner in which they question our use of bombings.""  Reparations  Amnesty called on the Philippine government to fully investigate the reported incidents and make reparations to all the victims who suffered from human rights violations.  It urged the government to consider lifting martial law on the island, which Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte imposed on the Mindanao region in May after the fighting in Marawi first broke out. Martial law is set to expire at the end of the year.  The human rights group also called on local authorities to rehabilitate the war-torn city as quickly as possible and provide support to displaced residents.  Diego, meanwhile, said what he experienced in Marawi has left him traumatised.  ""I will never go back to Marawi unless I carry a gun. I want to become a soldier. I want vengeance,"" he said.",en,terrorattack,,

Rawa borders Syria, whose army seized the last substantial town on the border with Iraq, Albu Kamal.  Rawa's capture marks the end of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria's (ISIS) era of territorial rule over a so-called caliphate that it proclaimed in 2014 across vast swathes of Iraq and Syria.  Iraqi forces ""liberated Rawa entirely, and raised the Iraqi flag over its buildings"", Lieutenant-General Abdul Ameer Rasheed Yarallah said in a statement from the Joint Operations Command.  Syria's army has also declared victory against ISIS, but last week militants re-infiltrated Albu Kamal and are still fighting there, as well as in some villages and desert areas nearby.  All the forces fighting ISIS in both countries expect a new phase of guerilla warfare, a tactic the militants have already shown themselves capable of.  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated the armed forces and people, saying Rawa was retaken in record time. ""Liberation of Rawa district in mere hours reflects the great strength and power of our heroic armed forces and the successful planning for battles,"" he said in a statement.  A video issued by the military showed Iraqi forces sending a message to Rawa's residents via radio which said, ""Daesh has ended for good, and now the age of Iraq begins"", referring to the Sunni militant group by an Arabic acronym.  Another showed a convoy of military vehicles sporting Iraqi flags and blasting out the national anthem. State television played patriotic songs and aired footage of troops in Rawa.  ""With the liberation of Rawa, we can say all the areas in which Daesh is present have been liberated,"" a military spokesman said. Iraqi forces will now focus on routing the militants who fled into the desert, and exert control over Iraq's borders, the spokesman said.  The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the stretch of desert which runs along the border of both countries.  Driven this year from its two de facto capitals - Iraq's Mosul and Syria's Raqqa - ISIS has been progressively squeezed into an ever-shrinking pocket of desert, straddling the frontier between the two countries, by enemies that include most regional states and global powers.  In Iraq, ISIS faced the army and the Shi'ite paramilitary groups, backed both by the US-led international coalition and by Iran. Iraq has been carrying out its final campaign to crush the ISIS caliphate, while also mounting an offensive in the north against the Kurds.  REUTERS",en,terrorattack,,

And Mr Mugabe has appeared to have toyed with his emotions - one day promoting him to senior positions in both the ruling Zanu-PF party and the government, raising speculation that Mr Mnangagwa was the ""heir apparent"", but later demoting him after he possibly displayed his ambitions a bit too openly.  But after his sacking, it seemed as though the patience of the man known as ""the crocodile"" finally snapped.  After Mr Mugabe dismissed him and publicly accused him of ""treachery"", his supporters in the security forces where he made his name intervened on his behalf.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who is the ""crocodile"" and is he behind the military takeover in Zimbabwe?  Image copyright AFP Image caption Zimbabwe Army General Constantino Chiwenga (left) is an ally of Mr Mnangagwa  He helped direct Zimbabwe's 1970s war of independence and later became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed.  He has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army.  But anyone hoping that a Mnangagwa presidency would see an end to human rights abuses in Zimbabwe could be mistaken. His critics say the 71-year-old has blood on his hands.  He is known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness, and his faction in Zanu-PF is therefore known as ""Lacoste"".  Who is Emmerson Mnangagwa?  Known as ""the crocodile"" - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste""  Received military training in China and Egypt  Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks  Helped direct Zimbabwe's 1970s war of independence  Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed  Seen as key link between army, intelligence agencies and Zanu-PF party  Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election  Those who fought in the 1970s war, like Mr Mnangagwa, have long monopolised power in Zimbabwe.  Afraid that they would lose their positions if Grace Mugabe were to succeed her husband, as seemed to be on the cards, they intervened.  When his close ally, Gen Constantino Chiwenga, warned against the ""purging which is clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"", it was obviously a reference to Mr Mnangagwa's sacking.  ""When it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,"" he warned, a threat which has now been carried out.  Congo connection  Mr Mnangagwa was born in the central region of Zvishavane and is from the Karanga sub-group of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community.  The Karangas are the largest Shona group and some feel it is their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru group.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Zimbabwean troops (above) intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between the Zanu party of Robert Mugabe (left) and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo (right)  According to a United Nations report in 2001, Mr Mnangagwa was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"".  This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals.  But despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, is not well-loved by the rank and file of his own party.  One veteran of Zimbabwe's war of independence, who worked with him for many years, put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel.""  Another Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?""  The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, would also agree that his rival is not a man of peace.  During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match.  Atrocities  Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu of Joshua Nkomo.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Mnangagwa is not well-loved by the rank and file of his Zanu-PF party  As National Security Minister, Mr Mnangagwa was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu.  Thousands of innocent civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF.  Among countless other atrocities, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly-dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans.  Despite the 1987 Unity Accord, the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland would be reluctant to support a Mnangagwa presidency.  Trained in China  Mr Mnangagwa, though, does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Zimbabwe's bitterly fought guerrilla that preceded independence formed the backdrop to Mr Mnangagwa's rise to power  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It appears as though Grace Mugabe (right) has bitten off more than she can chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa  They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the 1970s fight for independence.  He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party.  Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo).  ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says.  ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days.""  As he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison.  ""He has scars of that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named.  ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young.""  Ice cream plot  His previous demotion came in 2005, when he lost his post as Zanu-PF secretary for administration, which had enabled him to place his supporters in key party positions.  This followed reports that Mr Mnangagwa had been campaigning too hard for the post of vice-president.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Mnangagwa (right) has had a mercurial career serving under Mr Mugabe  But after Mr Mugabe lost the first round of the presidential election to his long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai in 2008, Mr Mnangagwa was rumoured to have masterminded Zanu-PF's political campaign, co-ordinating the party's links with both army and intelligence.  The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes.  Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected.  Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence.  But an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that Mr Mnangagwa was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF.  ""He cuts party finance deals, organises the campaign that links both security and party. He has Mugabe's ear on everything.""  That has obviously changed now.  His rivalry with Grace Mugabe took a bizarre turn earlier this year when he fell ill in August at a political rally led by President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa.  His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm.  But it appears as though by taking on Mr Mnangagwa, she had bitten off more than she could chew.",en,terrorattack,,

Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) meets with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia November 20, 2017. Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS  Russia is actively trying to build an international consensus around a peace deal for Syria, over two years after Moscow began a military intervention that turned the tide of the conflict in AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favour.  Putin will meet the leaders of Iran and Turkey, two other powers with major stakes in the Syrian conflict, on Wednesday. He said he would follow up his talks with Assad with phone calls to U.S. President Donald Trump and to Middle Eastern leaders.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We still have a long way to go before we achieve a complete victory over terrorists. But as far as our joint work in fighting terrorism on the territory of Syria is concerned, this military operation is indeed wrapping up,Ã¢â‚¬Â Putin told Assad, in comments broadcast by Russian television.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now the most important thing, of course, is to move on to the political questions, and I note with satisfaction your readiness to work with all those who want peace and a solution (to the conflict),Ã¢â‚¬Â Putin said.  The declared focus for RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peace efforts is a proposed Congress of Syrian Peoples, to include all the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethnic groups and the warring sides in the conflict.  Previous attempts to broker a peace deal have foundered because powers involved in the conflict have differing approaches. Iran, Russia and the Hezbollah militia have backed Assad, while the United States, Turkey, and the Gulf states have supported the Syrian leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opponents.  Some people familiar with the KremlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking say that, to reach a peace deal, Russia would not insist on Assad staying in power -- as long as the institutions of the Syrian state remained intact.  PEACE CONGRESS  Putin met Assad on Monday evening in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, although the Kremlin did not release information about AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s visit until Tuesday.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would like very much to discuss with you the main principles for organising the political process, and the holding of a congress of the peoples of Syria, that is supported by you,Ã¢â‚¬Â Putin told Assad.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would like to hear from you your assessment of the state of affairs today, and the prospects for the developments of the situation, including your view of the political process, which, in our view, must ultimately be carried out under the aegis of the United Nations.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia November 20, 2017. Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS  Putin and Assad last met on Oct. 20, 2015, a few weeks after Moscow launched its military operation in Syria, which has beaten back anti-Assad rebels and propped up struggling government forces.  For his meeting in Sochi, Assad stayed on Russian soil for a total of four hours, RIA news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. It was AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first publicly declared trip outside Syria since his 2015 visit to Moscow.  Wearing a dark suit and sitting across a small coffee table from Putin, Assad told the Russian leader: Ã¢â‚¬ÂAt this stage, especially after we achieved victory over terrorists, it is in our interests to move forward with the political process.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“And we believe that the situation we now have on the ground and in the political sense permits us to expect progress in the political process.

Slideshow (7 Images)  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to look backwards. We welcome all those who truly want to see a political solution. We are ready to have a dialogue with them,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Assad.  ASSADÃ¢â‚¬ËœS GRATITUDE  Underscoring the importance of the Russian military in propping up AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule, Putin presented the Syrian leader to top military commanders assembled at his Sochi residence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“On behalf of the entire Syrian people, I express my gratitude for what you have done,Ã¢â‚¬Â Assad told them.

Hundreds of Islamic State members and their families were allowed to leave Raqqa by Kurdish and Arab forces who captured the city in mid-October, spokesmen for the fighters and the U.S.-led alliance which supports them said.  The coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq said last month that biometric information including fingerprints was taken from the militants before their convoy left Raqqa, so they would be known ""if they resurface in the future"".  But two senior Turkish security officials told Reuters they had not seen any such data which would identify fighters from Raqqa among the hundreds of Islamic State suspects rounded up in security sweeps in Turkish cities over the last two weeks.  ""If the United States or the coalition received information about Islamic State members who were withdrawn from Raqqa and is not sharing it with Turkey, how will we fight against terrorism together?"" one official said.  ""We didn't receive any biometric data in this office,"" another security official said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  A third government official said he believed the biometric data had not been shared with Turkey.  Ankara has bitterly criticised the deal to allow militants to leave Raqqa, saying it suspects some fighters have been smuggled across Syria's northern border into Turkey and could pose an international threat.  ""These Islamic State members, released with their weapons, will cause deaths of innocent people in Europe, the United States, all over the world, especially in Turkey,"" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week.  His comments reflect long-running tensions with Washington over its support for the Kurdish YPG militia which spearheaded the fight to seize Raqqa from Islamic State, as well as Turkey's complaints at what it says is limited security cooperation.  Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) which has waged an insurgency in the south of the country since the 1980s, and says weapons supplied by the United States will fall under PKK control.  Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week that the Raqqa deal showed the YPG was more interested in gaining territory for a Kurdish state in Syria than defeating Islamic State. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they are not seeking secession.  ""They are in close cooperation with Daesh (Islamic State) there,"" Cavusoglu said. ""These organisations appear to be fighting when it suits them.""  ""NO RAQQA FIGHTERS ENTERED TURKEY""  The coalition said around 250 fighters, accompanied by 3,000 people it described as human shields, left Raqqa on Oct. 15 under the deal reached by Arab tribal leaders and a local civil council.  In a statement to Reuters, it said a coalition leader had attended talks where the deal was reached but was not an active participant, and it ""explicitly disagreed with letting armed ISIS (Islamic State) terrorists leave Raqqa"".  The coalition said screening of the departing fighters was carried out by Kurdish YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who took Raqqa, and the Raqqa Civil Council. It referred questions about the biometric data gleaned from the tests to those two bodies.  As far as it was aware ""none of the terrorists who departed Raqqa with the convoy on Oct. 15, 2017 were able to legally or illegally gain entry to Turkey,"" the coalition said, without saying whether it had been able to track them.  SDF spokesman Mostafa Bali said all the fighters who were allowed to leave Raqqa were in SDF detention. He did not say whether the biometric data had been shared.  But another Turkish official said Ankara suspected - based on interrogations of captured suspects - that some militants from Raqqa had managed to smuggle themselves across the border, despite increased security at crossings.  ""We believe some of the captured Islamic State militants may be from those that left Raqqa,"" he said. ""Since they came in with their families, we get this (information) from their families"".  There was no specific intelligence of a threat to Turkey or Europe at the moment, he added, but an attack could take place at any time. ""We have brought measures to counter this to their highest level,"" he said.  Exchange of information with Europe and the United States was continuing, despite any political differences, he added.  France, where militants killed 130 people in coordinated strikes across Paris in November 2015, said last week the threat of an attack was no greater than over the last two years and security services were either arresting or monitoring Islamist militants who returned from Syria and Iraq.

During a recent broadcast on German television, Holger Munch, director of the Federal German Police, said the terror threat is high and will likely stay that way for years to come.  According to Maximilian Kall, spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice, 85 percent of the cases are connected to radical Islamists.  This yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jump in terror-related investigations reflects the fear that some of the 890 Germans who joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq may be returning to Germany now that ISIS has lost virtually all the territory it occupied. With an Islamic caliphate no longer feasible, the military mission in the Middle East is less attractive and is being redirected to terrorist attacks in Europe.  German police are heavily engaged in surveillance and are gathering evidence that can be used in trials of suspected terrorists, or their supporters.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The rise in the numbers being investigated has proved to be a huge problem for the German court system because they have been flooded with cases over the past two years,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Elmar Thevessen, a terrorist analyst for ZDF, a large public television network.  Many of the federal cases have been transferred to provincial courts in the 16 German lander (states) in order to hasten trials.  The returning ISIS fighters who are trained for combat and the use of explosives pose a serious threat. ISIS is also increasing its calls to sympathizers throughout the world, telling them to use trucks, cars, and knives if conventional weapons are not available.  Police estimate there may be as many as 1,000 people in Germany who are potentially dangerous and willing to commit attacks, according to Thevessen.  Chancellor Angela MerkelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s controversial open-door policy brought 1.5 million refugees from the Middle East into Germany between 2015 and 2016.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There was chaos at the border and virtually no information about the real identity of the refugees and their countries of origin,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Florian Flade, an expert on Islam at Die Welt, a center- right German daily newspaper.  GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, or BfV, warned in 2016 that many unaccompanied adolescent refugees are susceptible to Jihadist propaganda, especially propaganda thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spread on social media. They quickly self-radicalize and are prepared to obey orders to kill non-Muslims.  According to Flade, many of the single young men who were part of the refugee influx become marginalized. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t speak German, are slow to integrate, and have missed years of school because of the wars in Syria and Iraq.  The BfV report finds that Ã¢â‚¬Å“all attacks carried out in Germany in 2016 can be classified as part of the phenomenon of the individual jihad, which means that they were committed by lone perpetrators, or small groups.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Fears that Islamic extremists have entered Germany with the refugee influx have helped fuel a xenophobic backlash against the refugees. This backlash is having a significant political impact.  The Alternative for Germany (AFD), a new far-right political party, had astonishing success in the national election on September 24, gaining 6 million votes and 94 seats in the Bundestag (parliament). The vehemently anti-refugee, nativist party, never before represented in the Bundestag, has now become the party with the third-largest representation. The increasing terrorist threat will likely add to its momentum.  Experts predict more, and bigger, terrorist attacks in Germany. According to Thevessen, chemicals may be used in future attacks because chemicals have been readily available in Syria and Iraq.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Authorities believe we may see big terrorist attacks in Europe within the next two years,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Munch, the director of the Federal German Police, warned that the threat goes well beyond Germany.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is not just a German national problem, it is a European one,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Munch. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Terrorist threats in Germany are a potential threat to all of Europe.Ã¢â‚¬Â",en,terrorattack,215,['Germany']
1116053,aljazeera,Pedzisai Ruhanya Is The Director Of The Harare-based Zimbabwe Democracy Institute About The Author P,Post-Mugabe Zimbabwe will be someone else's fiefdom,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/post-mugabe-zimbabwe-fiefdom-171121155603841.html,,22/11/2017 7:07,"For long in Zimbabwe's politics, the military has been the decisive force keeping President Robert Mugabe in power. In early November, it proved yet again that it is the kingmaker of Zimbabwean politics, thwarting first lady Grace Mugabe's plans to take over from her husband.  The influence that the army has exerted over the past decades has shaped Zimbabwe's regime into a neopatrimonial, personalistic, military oligarchy, with a primary role of keeping Mugabe and ZANU-PF in power. After Mugabe's resignation, the generals seem intent on introducing another member of the oligarchy into the presidency - most likely former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.  But whoever takes over the reins of power in Zimbabwe is unlikely to change the status quo. The regime and its many clients (including the military) will stay intact.  A long history of military politics  The war of liberation in the 1970s charted the political future of Zimbabwe in many ways. The two military groups which led the war - Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) affiliated with Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), and the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) affiliated with the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) - laid the foundations of the Zimbabwean army.  The two political movements, ZAPU and ZANU, dominated the political scene after independence in 1980 and eventually merged into one party called (ZANU-PF) in 1987. The war of liberation remained the main source of political legitimacy, as the majority of the political elite had a role to play in the armed struggle.  The vice-like grip of the military on political affairs is likely, if not certainly, going to continue in the post-Mugabe era.  Robert Mugabe himself was the commander of ZANLA. His vice president, Mnangagwa, was also part of the ZANLA, although his ""struggle credentials"" were questioned during the political campaign against him led by Mugabe's wife, Grace.  {articleGUID}  Therefore, since independence, the military has played a major role in the political scene in Zimbabwe.  Following the formation of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in 1999, the military was involved in torture, kidnappings and killings of opposition supporters in the 2000 parliamentary elections. Before the 2002 elections, all senior military officers pledged that they would not serve under a president other than Mugabe, and the army joined the campaigns of intimidation of opposition supporters.  The army also participated in the 2000 land reforms which saw the forceful expropriation of land from white farmers. In 2001, Mugabe deployed troops on white-owned farms to ""speed up"" the process, which resulted in the death of more than a dozen white farmers.  Most notably, the army launched a violent campaign in the June 2008 presidential election run-off, after Mugabe lost the March 29 presidential election to MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Mugabe won the run-off through military intervention, but the outcome was dismissed by the international community.  Apart from being regularly mobilised to solve Mugabe's political problems, the military has also acquired power over decision-making in various levels of the state.  The military is deployed to the commissariat of ZANU-PF and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to campaign and administer elections respectively. Its personnel occupies various positions in government ministries such as agriculture, land, justice and economic development. They run state programmes such as the Fast Track Land Reform and, of late, the Command Agriculture scheme.  Retired members of the military with liberation backgrounds are appointed as judges of the High Court, such as the current Judge President, retired Major General Justice George Chiweshe.  Others head key government parastatals such the Grain Marketing Board and the National Railways of Zimbabwe. While in these positions, members of the military are involved in partisan distribution of food handouts in times of drought. Those deployed in the justice system have been accused of subverting the rule of law, through selective application of the law against opponents of the regime.  The same applies to retired military personnel in the police force. They rarely arrest members of the ruling party for human rights abuses or other crimes.  A continuation of the old regime  The vice-like grip of the military on political affairs is likely, if not certainly, going to continue in the post-Mugabe era, and it will be the bedrock of a possible Mnangagwa presidency.  In this regard, the role of the military in the transition, given its power, economic influence, and monopoly of coercive force, will shape or break this transition. If the military decides not to hand over power to the preferred civilian faction led by Mnangagwa, the country could be turned into a vicious military dictatorship.  {articleGUID}  If the military resists such temptations and hands over power to Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe's future will be more of the same: a limited political sphere and a dwindled economy exhausted by continuing kleptocracy.  The new president will continue to treat the state as his private fiefdom and give only rhetorical attention to formal political institutions. The elite's access to farms, government inputs like maize seeds and fertilisers for farming, mining claims, fuel, government financial resources, and immunity from prosecution will be more compelling grounds for them to hold on to power than to push for reform.  Mnangagwa and his military backers are likely to go for authoritarian state capitalism along the Chinese model. There will be liberalisation of the economy without democratisation as long-term political and economic trajectories.  This means that ordinary citizens would not enjoy the benefits of the mining and agriculture potential of the economy, as elites will continue to loot the resources. The lack of medicine, good hospitals, clean water, schools and the general improvement of the population will continue.  Therefore, life for the average Zimbabwean is unlikely to change under the new presidency, unless there is huge investment to attract new money, to open closed industries and create new ones that come with jobs for the over 90 percent of unemployed people in Zimbabwe.  The new regime faces challenges of political legitimacy and an economy under recession and informalisation. In order to address the legitimacy question, the new regime will most probably seek to form a coalition government with opposition leaders such as Tsvangirai of the MDC.  Such a coalition could last until the next election in 2018 or be extended. This will pacify the population to avoid a possible uprising as a result of huge expectation for socioeconomic development.  Whatever happens with the government, however, the presidency will definitely be secured. The Zimbabwean military will be there, as always, the guarantor and kingmaker.

He said the Rohingya had suffered ""horrendous atrocities"" and as a result the US was considering targeted sanctions against those responsible.  In September, UN human rights chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein also accused Myanmar of ethnic cleansing.  Mr Tillerson's comments come days before a visit to Myanmar by the Pope.  The Rohingya are a stateless minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, also known as Burma. More than 600,000 have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since violence erupted in Rakhine state late in August.  ""After a careful and thorough analysis of available facts, it is clear that the situation in northern Rakhine state constitutes ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya,"" Mr Tillerson said in a statement.  ""These abuses by some among the Burmese military, security forces, and local vigilantes have caused tremendous suffering and forced hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to flee their homes in Burma to seek refuge in Bangladesh,"" he said.  He said the US wanted an independent investigation into events in Rakhine state and targeted sanctions could follow.  ""Those responsible for these atrocities must be held accountable,"" he added.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts  Mr Tillerson's comments reflect a hardening US stance on Myanmar in recent days. On a one-day visit to the country last week he said Washington was ""deeply concerned"" by reports of widespread atrocities.  He urged the government and security forces to respect the human rights of all those within its borders.  US builds pressure on Myanmar  Analysis by Barbara Plett Usher, US state department correspondent  The designation comes after careful analysis by the State Department, which determined that there was 'intent and planning' behind the 'horrendous atrocities.' Hence Rex Tillerson included the Myanmar military among the parties listed as directly involved.  A senior state department official said the term ethnic cleansing is not defined in international or US law and therefore doesn't inherently imply consequences, but the US is considering targeted sanctions against those responsible.  In the meantime, another senior official said the designation was aimed at increasing pressure on Mynamar authorities to repatriate the Rohingya refugees and make it safe for them to return.  The US has sought to balance its desire to hold the military accountable with its support for the civilian government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi.  The State Department official said a successful transition to civilian rule is crucial to resolving the long-running ethnic conflicts at the root of the latest violence. (Ms Suu Kyi has been criticized for a weak response, but the official said she had no control over the military in their power sharing arrangement, and that she'd have to work with the generals to address the crisis).  The tougher US rhetoric comes after a delegation, led by Senator Jeff Merkley, recently returned from a visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh.  Members of the delegation said they were disturbed by the reports of attacks on Rohingya, including the rape and murder of family members.  The BBC has also heard numerous first-hand reports from refugees of killings, rape and even massacres. Inside Rakhine state itself, a BBC crew witnessed burned out homes and a Muslim village being set on fire.  Despite widespread accusations of human rights violations, Myanmar has consistently denied persecuting its Rohingya minority.  Earlier this month, the Myanmar army released the results of an internal investigation in which it exonerated itself of blame for the crisis.  It said ""terrorists"" from within the Rohingya community (which it called Bengali) were responsible for burning houses and that those who fled did so because they feared those terrorists.  Amnesty International dismissed the report as an attempted ""whitewash"".  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: Who are the Rohingya?  Amid growing international concern over the crisis, China recently proposed a three-stage plan starting with a ceasefire to allow refugees to return to Myanmar.  China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said talks should follow and the final phase would be a long-term solution to end poverty among the Rohingya.  Beijing has close ties with both Myanmar and Bangladesh and in the past has had to deal with thousands of refugees seeking shelter in China after fleeing lawless border regions.  Pope Francis is due to arrive in Myanmar on 26 November. His visit will include meetings with army chief General Min Aung Hlaing and the country's de-facto civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, the Vatican has said.  The pontiff will later travel to the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, where he will meet Rohingya refugees, a Vatican spokesman said on Wednesday.",en,terrorattack,217,"['US', 'Myanmar']"

The grand imam of Cairo's Al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, condemned ""in the strongest terms this barbaric terrorist attack"".  IS TARGETING OF SUFIS  There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bloodshed.  The Islamic State group's Egypt branch has killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, and also civilians accused of working with the authorities, in attacks in the north of the Sinai peninsula.  They have also targeted followers of the mystical Sufi branch of Sunni Islam as well as Christians.  The victims of Friday's attack included civilians and conscripts praying at the mosque.  A tribal leader and head of a Bedouin militia that fights IS told AFP that the mosque is known as a place of gathering for Sufis.  The Islamic State group shares the puritan Salafi view of Sufis as heretics for seeking the intercession of saints.  The militants had previously kidnapped and beheaded an elderly Sufi leader, accusing him of practising magic which Islam forbids, and abducted Sufi practitioners later released after ""repenting.""  An IS propaganda outlet had published an interview earlier with the commander of its ""morality police"" in Sinai who said their ""first priority was to combat the manifestations of polytheism including Sufism.""  The group has killed more than 100 Christians in church bombings and shootings in Sinai and other parts of Egypt, forcing many to flee the peninsula.  The military has struggled to quell militants who pledged allegiance to IS in November 2014.  IS regularly conducts attacks against soldiers and policemen in the peninsula bordering Israel and the Palestinian Gaza Strip, although the frequency and scale of such attacks has diminished over the past year.  The militants have since increasingly turned to civilian targets, attacking not only Christians and Sufis but also Bedouin Sinai inhabitants accused of working with the army.  The Gaza Strip's border crossing with Egypt that had been due to reopen Saturday will remain closed until further notice because of the attack, a Palestinian official said.  Aside from IS, Egypt also faces a threat from Al-Qaeda-aligned militants who operate out of neighbouring Libya.  A group calling itself Ansar al-Islam - Supporters of Islam in Arabic - claimed an October ambush in Egypt's Western Desert that killed at least 16 policemen.  Many of those killed belonged to the interior ministry's secretive National Security Service.

HARARE: Inside State House in Harare, Robert Mugabe was in the tightest spot of his 37-year rule. Tanks were on the streets and troops had occupied the state broadcaster, from where the army had announced it had taken control of Zimbabwe.  Mugabe, 93 years old but still alert, remained defiant. The only leader the country had known since independence was refusing to quit.  At a tense meeting with his military top brass on Nov. 16, the world's oldest head of state put his foot down: ""Bring me the constitution and tell me what it says,"" he ordered military chief Constantino Chiwenga, according to two sources present.  An aide brought a copy of the constitution, which lays out that the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.  Chiwenga, dressed in camouflage fatigues, hesitated before replying that Zimbabwe was facing a national crisis that demanded military intervention.  Mugabe retorted that the army was the problem, according to the sources present. Then the beleaguered president indicated that perhaps they could find a solution together.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The meeting marked the start of an extraordinary five-day standoff between Mugabe and Zimbabwe's supreme law on one side, and the military, his party and Zimbabwe's people on the other.  The generals wanted Mugabe to go, but they also wanted a peaceful ""coup,"" one that would not irreparably tarnish the administration aiming to take over, according to multiple military and political sources.  The president finally accepted defeat only after he was sacked by his own ZANU-PF party and faced the ignominy of impeachment. He signed a short letter of resignation to parliament speaker Jacob Mudenda that was read out to lawmakers on Nov 21.  Mugabe, who had run Zimbabwe since 1980 and overseen its descent into economic ruin while his wife shopped for luxury goods, was gone.  The country erupted into ecstasy. Parliamentarians danced and people poured onto the streets in their tens of thousands to celebrate a political downfall that sent shockwaves across Africa and the world.  To many, the end of Mugabe had been unthinkable only one week before.  Reuters has pieced together the events leading up to Mugabe's removal, showing that the army's action was the culmination of months of planning that stretched from Harare to Johannesburg to Beijing.  BITTER RIVALRY  Drawing on a trove of intelligence documents from within Mugabe's feared Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Reuters reported in September that the army was backing Emmerson Mnangagwa, then vice president, to succeed Mugabe when the time came.  The report detailed how Mnangagwa, a lifelong friend and former security chief of Mugabe, might cooperate with Mugabe's political foes in order to revive the economy. It caused furore in Zimbabwe's media and political circles.  Bitter rivalry intensified between Mnangagwa and Grace, Mugabe's 52-year-old wife, who also hoped to take over as president and had the backing of a ZANU-PF faction known as G40.  In early October, Mnangagwa said he had been airlifted to hospital in South Africa after a poisoning attempt in August. He pointed no fingers - but he didn't need to.  Grace's swift response was to deny it and accuse her rival of seeking sympathy; she belittled him as nothing but an employee of her husband, according to a report in the state-run Herald newspaper.  As the pressure built, Mugabe became increasingly paranoid about the loyalty of army chief Chiwenga, a career soldier and decorated veteran of Zimbabwe's 1970s bush-war against white-minority rule.  Mugabe's spies, who permeated every institution and section of society in Zimbabwe, were warning him the military would not accept Grace as president.  ""Mugabe is very worried of a coup,"" one intelligence report, dated Oct 23, said. ""Mugabe was openly told by senior CIOs that the military is not going to easily accept the appointment of Grace. He was warned to be ready for civil war.""  Reuters reviewed the document, and hundreds of other intelligence reports dating back to 2009, before the coup took place. The documents come from within the CIO, but Reuters could not determine for whom they were written. The CIO is split into factions, some pro- and some anti-Mugabe.  In late October, Mugabe summoned Chiwenga to a showdown, according to another of the documents, dated Oct 30. It said Mugabe confronted the army chief about his ties to Mnangagwa and told him that going against Grace would cost him his life.  ""Chiwenga was warned by Mugabe that it is high time for him to start following. He mentioned to Chiwenga that those fighting his wife are bound to die a painful death,"" the intelligence report said.  At the same meeting, Mugabe also ordered Chiwenga to pledge allegiance to Grace. He refused.  ""Chiwengwa refused to be intimidated. He stood his ground over his loyalty to Mnangagwa,"" the report said.  Reuters put questions about this exchange and other aspects of this article to Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba. In an enigmatic text message dated Nov 23, he replied: ""Enjoy Reuters copy. Goodnight.""  Two spokesmen for Chiwenga declined to comment.  After another tense meeting with Mugabe on Nov 5, Chiwenga left Harare on a pre-arranged official trip and travelled to China, which wields significant influence as a major investor in Zimbabwe.  A day later, Mugabe sacked Mnangagwa as vice president and purged him from ZANU-PF, the liberation movement that Mnangagwa had served since his youth and for which, as a young militant caught bombing a train, he had nearly been executed.  For the generals, Mugabe had gone too far. The military immediately activated a ""Code Red"" alert, its highest level of preparedness, a military source said.  ASSASSINATION PLOT  Moments after Mnangagwa was ousted on Nov. 6, the security details assigned to him and his house were withdrawn, according to a statement he issued later. He was told his life was in danger.  ""Security personnel, who are friendly to me, warned me that plans were underfoot to eliminate me once arrested and taken to a police station,"" Mnangagwa said in a Nov 21 statement. ""It was in my security interest to leave the country immediately.""  From Harare, he managed to escape over the border into neighbouring Mozambique, where he caught a plane to China, according to one source familiar with his movements. There he met up with Chiwenga, the source said.  Reuters could not confirm the account; but an intelligence report from Nov 13 indicates that Mugabe suspected some of his generals of preparing to overthrow him from China.  ""A number of generals are now in China ready to plot Mugabe's ouster with Mnangagwa,"" the report said. It was not clear which generals, and whether their travel to China was authorised.  Mugabe's spies suspected old allies had turned against the ageing president. An intelligence report, dated Oct 30, said Beijing and Moscow both supported regime change out of frustration at Zimbabwe's economic implosion under Mugabe.  ""China and Russia are after change,"" the report said. ""They are after change within ZANU-PF as they are sick and tired of Mugabe's leadership.""  ""The two countries are even ready to clandestinely supply arms of war to Mnangagwa to fight Mugabe.""  Neither China's Defence Ministry nor Foreign Ministry responded to a request for comment. The Foreign Ministry had previously said Chiwenga's visit was ""a normal military exchange mutually agreed upon by China and Zimbabwe.""  Reuters sent written requests for comment to the Kremlin, the Russian Defence Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry. None of them responded.  China has long taken an interest in Zimbabwe, having supported Mugabe's forces during the liberation struggle. After independence it developed connections there in mining, security and construction.  Russia has also had ties to Zimbabwe since the early 1980s, and in 2014 a Russian consortium entered into a partnership to develop a US$3 billion platinum mining project in the country.  Chiwenga's trip to China culminated in him meeting Chinese Defence Minister Chang Wanquan in Beijing on Nov 10.  Two sources with knowledge of the talks told Reuters that Chiwenga asked if China would agree not to interfere if he took temporary control in Zimbabwe to remove Mugabe from power. Chang assured him Beijing would not get involved and the two also discussed tactics that might be employed during the de facto coup, the sources said.  Reuters could not establish whether Mnangagwa met Chang.  Having got wind of the talks in China, Mugabe summoned his still-loyal police commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, and his deputy, Innocent Matibiri, to detain Chiwenga on his return to Harare, government and security sources said.  The pair assembled a squad of 100 police and intelligence agents. But the plot leaked and Chiwenga supporters managed to pull together a counter-team of several hundred special forces soldiers and agents as their commander's plane approached.  Some were disguised as baggage handlers, their military fatigues and weapons hidden beneath high-visibility jackets and overalls, one security source said.  Realising they were outnumbered and outgunned, Chihuri's police team backed down, allowing Chiwenga to touch down without incident, the security source said.  Mugabe's spokesman did not comment on the incident.  ""VERY ALARMED""  Two days later, Chiwenga and a group of military commanders demanded a meeting with Mugabe at his official State House residence in Harare, an ornate colonial villa complete with stuffed leopards and thick red carpets, according to a government source.  They said they were ""very alarmed"" at the firing of Mnangagwa and told Mugabe to rein in his wife and her G40 faction, whom they accused of trying to divide the military, according to the government official, who was present at the discussions.  ""What do you think should be done?"" Mugabe demanded of the soldiers as he sat slumped in an armchair.  The generals asked him to give assurances that they too would not be purged. Mugabe's response was lukewarm, the government source said. Chiwenga told Mugabe he would be making his concerns about the G40 faction public.  Hours later, Chiwenga summoned reporters to the military's main barracks near Harare to issue a statement.  ""We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,"" he said, reading from a prepared text.  The following afternoon, Reuters reported six armoured personnel carriers heading towards the headquarters of Mugabe's Presidential Guard on the outskirts of Harare. It was unclear whose command they were under.  At the time, the city's residents were on edge but still unsure what it all meant.  THE LINE WENT DEAD  At around 6pm on Nov 14, Mugabe's motorcade headed to his private ""Blue Roof"" residence, a heavily fortified compound in the capital's leafy northern suburb of Borrowdale.  Meanwhile, social media buzzed with pictures of armoured vehicles driving along roads to Harare, sparking frenzied speculation about a coup.  Increasingly concerned, Grace put in a call shortly after 7pm to a cabinet minister asking to get WhatsApp and Twitter shut down, according to one source familiar with a recording of the conversation.  The minister, whose identity Reuters is withholding for safety reasons, replied that such a move was the responsibility of state security minister Kembo Mohadi.  ""No-one will stand for a coup. It cannot happen,"" said Grace, commonly referred to as Amai, which means Mother, according to a source who heard the recording.  Mugabe's voice is then heard on the line: ""As you have heard from Amai, is there anything that can be done?""  The minister gave the same response, about the responsibilities of state security, and the line went dead, the source said.  Mohadi declined to comment.  Two hours later, two armoured vehicles rolled into the Pockets Hill headquarters of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), according to ZBC sources.  Dozens of soldiers sealed off the site and stormed into the studios where they accosted staff, snatching their phones and halting programmes. State-owned ZBC, widely seen as a mouthpiece for Mugabe, switched to broadcasting pop music videos.  Mugabe's inner circle, nearly all of them G40 loyalists, had no idea what was under way, according to four sources familiar with their conversations.  Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo called Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi to ask if he had any information about a possible coup. Sekeramayi said no, but tried to check with military chief Chiwenga.  Chiwenga told Sekeramayi he would get back to him. According to the sources, Chiwenga never did.  Moyo remains in hiding and was unavailable for comment. Sekeramayi declined to comment.  SECURITY DETAIL  As ministers in the G40 faction tried frantically to work out what was going on, Chiwenga's men closed in on Mugabe's compound.  According to a source briefed on the situation, Albert Ngulube, a CIO director and head of Mugabe's security detail, was driving home around 9.30pm after visiting Mugabe. He met an armoured car on Borrowdale Brooke, a side road leading to Mugabe's house.  When Ngulube confronted the soldiers and threatened to shoot them, they beat him up and detained him, the source said. Ngulube was later released, but had suffered head and facial injuries, the source added.  Spokesmen for Chiwenga and Mnangagwa declined to comment. Reuters was unable to contact Ngulube.  Other G40 ministers were also picked up by soldiers. Finance minister Ignatius Chombo was found hiding in a toilet at his house and beaten before being detained at an undisclosed location for more than a week.  On his release on Nov 24, he was hospitalised with injuries to his hands, legs and back, his lawyer told Reuters, describing the army's behaviour as ""brutal and draconian.""  Soldiers used explosives to blow the front door off the house of Jonathan Moyo, the main brains behind G40, according to video footage of the house seen by Reuters. Others burst through the front gates of the residence of local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, another key Grace supporter.  Both men managed to escape to Mugabe's residence. Contacted by Reuters shortly after midnight in the early hours of Nov 15, Kasukuwere was audibly stressed. ""I can't talk. I'm in a meeting,"" he said, before hanging up.  For another week, Mugabe clung on to the presidency as Chiwenga and his forces tried to engineer a peaceful, and quasi-legal, exit for the long-serving leader.  But as parliament began impeachment proceedings on Nov 21, Mugabe finally gave up. After 37 years in control, during which much of his country fell into poverty, his letter of resignation said he was stepping down out of ""concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe.""",en,terrorattack,,

The 20-year-old, born in Australia to Somali parents, was detained in a raid on a house in the Melbourne suburb of Werribee on Monday. He is expected to be charged later Tuesday.  Police claim he accessed a guide book online produced by Al-Qaeda on how to commit terror acts and use firearms, but was arrested before he could purchase an automatic rifle.  ""What we will be alleging is that he was intending to use a firearm to shoot and kill as many people as he could in the Federation Square area on New Year's Eve,"" said Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton.  ""It is a tremendous concern to us that (during) the festive season, when people are out enjoying themselves, that there is a potential plot to commit a terrorist act. That is a huge issue for us but that is why we put the resources in.""  He said the arrest meant the threat ""has been removed"".  Advertisement  Advertisement  Federation Square is in the heart of the city, opposite busy Flinders Street train station and St Paul's Cathedral. It is one of the most popular places to see in the new year and would be packed on Dec 31.  The foiled plot comes a year after police prevented another attack in the same area on Christmas Day, arresting several men who planned to use explosives, knives and guns to target the location.  Patton said the man, who lived with his parents, had been on their radar since the beginning of the year, part of a small community of extremists that police have been monitoring.  His behaviour had gradually escalated over time, but police believe he was acting alone.  ""The potential of the attack was catastrophic,"" said Patton, adding that the man was an ""Islamic State sympathiser"".  Asked if he had been inspired by last year's Christmas Day plot, Patton said how he became radicalised was still being investigated.  ""We will be exploring where this person of interest got the idea from,"" he said. ""Certainly, he becomes particularly energised when he sees other activities in the terrorist arena occurring.""  Australian officials have grown increasingly concerned over the threat of extremist attacks, raising the national terror alert level to ""probable"" in September 2014.  Since then, 74 people have been arrested in 347 counter-terror investigations.  Authorities say 13 attacks have been prevented in the past few years, including an IS-directed attempt to bring down a plane using poisonous gas or a crude bomb disguised as a meat mincer.  Despite this, several attacks have taken place, including a cafe siege in Sydney in 2014 where two hostages were killed.",en,terrorattack,229,['Australia']

The Arab Organisation for Human Rights in the UK accuses the UAE government, part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting Huthi rebels in Yemen, of ""indiscriminate attacks against civilians"", lawyer Joseph Breham said.  The London-based AOHR further charges that the UAE has used banned cluster bombs and hired mercenaries to carry out torture and executions.  ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda will have to decide whether or not to open a preliminary probe.  Yemen and the UAE are not signatories to the Rome Statute which underpins the court in The Hague, so Bensouda would only have jurisdiction if nationals from another country were involved.  ""Our complaint targets acts perpetrated on Yemeni territory by the United Arab Emirates which does not recognise the ICC,"" said Paris-based Breham.  Advertisement  Advertisement  But he added: ""The perpetrators of these crimes are mercenaries employed by the Emirates and coming from Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, South Africa or Australia - countries that recognise the ICC.""  It would therefore be possible for the court to launch an investigation, Breham said, accusing Emirati forces of ""air strikes targeting civilian homes, hospitals and schools"".  Since the court opened in 2002, the prosecutor's office has received about 10,000 requests from individuals, groups or countries to investigate alleged crimes.  This year alone, activists from Mexico, Venezuela, the Philippines and the Palestinian territories have all sought to secure or broaden ICC probes.  There are currently 10 preliminary ICC examinations and 11 full investigations under way. Most existing probes have so far focused on African nations.  TORTURE CLAIMS    The AOHR accuses Emirati forces of using mercenaries to torture prisoners in Yemeni government-held jails and carrying out executions.  In June, Human Rights Watch accused the UAE of running at least two ""informal detention facilities"" in Yemen and said it had reportedly transferred detainees to a base in Eritrea.  The UAE rejected the allegations as ""totally unfounded"", saying its forces ""respect international conventions on armed conflicts"".  The UAE has been supporting Riyadh-backed Yemeni government forces since March 2015 in their conflict against the rebels, who are backed by Saudi Arabia's regional arch-rival Iran.  The UN's Human Rights Council agreed in September to send war crimes investigators to Yemen, overcoming resistance from Saudi Arabia, which fought to head off an independent international probe.  The UAE has played a key role in the Saudi-led campaign, which was launched in March 2015 to roll back gains by Huthi rebels, who had taken the capital Sanaa and other northern and central areas of one of the Arab world's poorest nations.  UN officials say Yemen could face the world's largest famine in decades unless the Saudi-led coalition's crippling blockade on ports and airports is lifted.  UN children's fund UNICEF warned Sunday that more than 11 million Yemeni children are in desperate need of humanitarian aid.

1157755,cnn,Sandee Lamotte,"Scarlet fever cases rise, leaving researchers baffled",http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/27/health/scarlet-fever-mystery-study/index.html,27/11/2017 0:00,28/11/2017 14:46,"(CNN) The age-old killer scarlet fever is on the rise in England and East Asia, according to research published Monday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, and investigators don't know why.  ""Whilst current rates (in England) are nowhere near those seen in the early 1900s, the magnitude of the recent upsurge is greater than any documented in the last century,"" said study author Theresa Lamagni of Public Health England, the agency that funded the analysis. ""Whilst notifications so far for 2017 suggest a slight decrease in numbers, we continue to monitor the situation carefully ... and research continues to further investigate the rise.""  Identified by a bright red rash that looks and feels like sandpaper, scarlet fever is a highly contagious disease caused by the same bacteria behind strep throat, group A Streptococcus pyogenes.  Historically a common cause of childhood death, scarlet fever had been declining over the past two centuries, according to the study, with any rise in cases typically following a ""natural cyclical pattern"" every four to six years.  But since 2009, cases have been steadily increasing in several East Asian countries, including Vietnam, South Korea, Hong Kong and mainland China.  An outbreak then hit England, where cases tripled in one year, from 4,700 in 2013 to 15,637 in 2014. Infections continued to rise to nearly 20,000 in 2016, a 50-year high for the United Kingdom, according to the analysis.  Hospital admissions during the outbreak in England are also high, the researchers said, nearly doubling between 2013 (703 cases) and 2016 (1,300 cases).  Identifying scarlet fever  Although anyone who gets strep throat can get scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina, the disease typically strikes children under the age of 10. Frequently spread by droplets via coughing and sneezing, group A strep can also hide on doorknobs, plates and utensils for hours  The red rash that gives scarlet fever its name typically starts on the neck and face and spreads to the chest, the back and other parts of the body. At first, the rash will look like a bad sunburn, but then it will begin to raise and become bumpy. If pressed, the red skin will turn white; it can also be itchy. Once the rash subsides, the skin will often peel, especially on the groin, fingertips and toes.  A very sore, red throat that makes it difficult to swallow, along with a fever of 101 or higher, is a key sign of scarlet fever, along with swollen neck glands, headaches and body chills, nausea and vomiting.  An early symptom can be a ""strawberry"" tongue -- one that looks more red and bumpy than usual -- along with a whitish coating on inside of the throat. Other telltale signs include be a flushed face (except for a white streak around the mouth) and red streaks in the creases of the skin, with the armpits, knees and elbows showing a deeper hue.  Treatment for scarlet fever is the same as for strep: a course of antibiotics, which must be completed to be rid of the bacteria and avoid a relapse. If the regimen is followed appropriately, the disease is usually gone within a couple of weeks. Left untreated, it can lead to serious illness or even death.  Complications of scarlet fever can include Bright's disease, a form of kidney damage, and rheumatic fever, an autoimmune disease that affects the heart, joins, skin and brain. If rheumatic fever affects the heart, it can cause long-term damage. That's one of the reasons scarlet fever was a leading cause of heart disease for adults before penicillin was discovered.  Over the centuries, scarlet fever has caused devastating epidemics . Those infected were often isolated for weeks, while their bedding and belongings were burned to prevent disease spread. Why the prevalence of the disease began to decline, even before the wide-spread use of antibiotics, is a mystery.  Detective work is underway  Why the disease is making a resurgence today is also a mystery, according to the study. Investigators are looking at such possibilities as a change in human immune status, environmental causes and even the disease traveling from Asia to England, although evidence for that is slight. Though the cases in the United Kingdom came from at least three known strains, only one of those was also seen in Hong Kong, and only in few cases.  ""Whilst there is no clear connection between the situation in the UK and East Asia, a link cannot be excluded without better understanding of the drivers behind these changes,"" Lamagni said. ""The hunt for further explanations for the rise in scarlet fever goes on.""  Meanwhile, she suggests that parents in England keep an eye out for telltale signs and act quickly to get their children, or themselves, to a doctor for evaluation and treatment.  ""Guidance on management of outbreaks in schools and nurseries has just been updated, and research continues to further investigate the rise,"" she said. ""We encourage parents to be aware of the symptoms of scarlet fever and to contact their (general practitioner) if they think their child might have it.""

In a comment published alongside the paper, University of Queensland professors Mark Walker and Stephan Brouwer recommend that public health systems around the world be on guard.

With crucial aid from allies Iran and Russia, President Bashar Assad has regained control over large areas of Syria in advances that appear to have put to rest the possibility of a military overthrow, at least for now. But his rule is extremely reliant on continued assistance from Iranian-sponsored militias, which have spread across the war-ravaged country.  The fight against the Islamic State group, which proliferated soon after the conflict began in 2011, has provided a convenient justification for foreign troops to be deployed in Syria with the pretext of fighting the extremists. Now that IS no longer holds any significant urban territory in Syria, the numbers of some forces may be scaled down, but foreign powers with longer-term ambitions and interests will try to maintain a presence in the country for years to come. That will further complicate prospects for a peace settlement.  Some countries have already indicated that they plan to stay for the foreseeable future.  THE AMERICANS  The presence of U.S. troops in northern Syria was initially meant to help train and support Kurdish-dominated local forces fighting the Islamic State group.  The number of troops has grown gradually. Although the official limit on U.S. troops has remained at 503 since shortly before President Barack Obama left office, the actual number is now believed to be more than 1,500, including special forces, a Marine artillery unit, forward air controllers and others. They are spread across more than a dozen bases in northern Syria.  The end of the fight against IS takes away any legal justification for the presence of U.S. troops in Syria, but U.S. officials are now suggesting they plan to maintain a U.S. troop presence in the north until an overall settlement for the war is found. That has raised concern about a more permanent project that risks drawing the U.S. into a conflict with Syria and Assad's ally, Iran.  ""We're not just going to walk away right now before the Geneva process has cracked,"" U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said earlier this month, referring to the U.N.-backed political talks.  Kurdish officials have asked the U.S. to stay on, fearing that a quick withdrawal would facilitate Assad's forces swooping in on Kurdish-held territory in the north.  Earlier this month, the Syrian government called on the United States to withdraw its forces now that the fight against the Islamic State group is nearly over. The Foreign Ministry statement said the presence of U.S. troops will not force a political solution to the conflict.  THE RUSSIANS  Russia has never said how many of its military personnel, warplanes and other weapons are in Syria. Turnout figures in voting from abroad in the September 2016 parliamentary election indicated the number of Russian military personnel in Syria at the time was about 4,300. The Russian presence has likely increased, as Moscow this year deployed its military police to patrol so-called ""de-escalation zones"" in Syria.  Open-source materials Ã¢â‚¬â€ including video from the Hemeimeem air base, the main hub for the Russian military in Syria since its campaign began in September 2015 Ã¢â‚¬â€ indicate that Russia has several dozen jets and helicopter gunships there.  Russia also has deployed special forces to conduct intelligence and coordinate airstrikes. Senior Russian military officers also have helped train and direct Syrian government troops. In recent months, Russian military police have become increasingly visible in Syria.  The chief of the Russian military general staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, said last week that Russia will ""significantly"" reduce its military foothold in Syria as the campaign nears its end.  At the same time, he indicated Russia will maintain a presence at both the Hemeimeem air base and the navy supply facility in Tartus. Gerasimov added that the military's Reconciliation Center, a group of officers who have helped negotiate and maintain truces in Syria and coordinated the delivery of humanitarian aid, also will stay.  Syria has allowed Russia to use Hemeimeem air base indefinitely without cost. Moscow also has signed a deal with Syria to use the Tartus base for 49 years, which could be extended if both parties agree.  The Russian military plans to modernize the air base to allow it to host more warplanes. It also intends to expand the Tartus facility significantly to make it a full-scale naval base capable of hosting warships, including cruiser-sized vessels.  THE IRANIANS AND SPONSORED MILITIAS  Of all the foreign troops in Syria, perhaps none have been as widespread and potentially lasting as the Iranians. The Islamic Republic of Iran has made an enormous effort to keep Assad in power, providing extensive military and financial support throughout the six-year civil war.  It has deployed Islamic Revolutionary Guards in Syria as well as Iranian officers who provide military and political support. Iranian officials say more than 1,000 Iranian fighters have been killed in Syria and Iraq after they were deployed to defend Shiite holy shrines.  Tens of thousands of Iranian-sponsored pro-government local militias known as the National Defense Forces are deployed across Syria, in addition to Iraqi Shiite militias and thousands of Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon who have been key factors in turning the war in the government's favor. Hezbollah is deployed in wide areas along Syria's border with Lebanon, where the Shiite group has built military facilities and long-term bases it is unlikely to leave anytime soon.  Iran's strategy aims to ensure it can continue to pursue its vital interests after the war, using parts of Syria as a base and making certain that a land corridor from Tehran to Beirut remains open.  THE TURKS  Turkey first sent ground forces into Syria last year in a campaign dubbed ""Operation Euphrates Shield."" It was aimed at fighting the Islamic State group, although Turkey also seeks, above all, to limit the expansion of Syria's Kurds along its border with Syria. Ankara perceives the Syrian Kurdish fighters to be an extension of the Kurdish insurgents who have waged a three- decade insurgency in Turkey.  Turkish officials have not disclosed how many Turkish soldiers are deployed in Syria but security experts estimate that at least 2,500 troops are stationed in a swath of territory revolving around the towns of al-Rai, al-Bab and Jarablus Ã¢â‚¬â€ a border zone that Turkey and Turkey-backed rebels took back from IS last year under ""Euphrates Shield.""  An estimated 400 more Turkish troops are in the Idlib region as part of an agreement reached among Turkey, Russia and Iran to create a ""de-escalation zone"" in the area.  Turkey is building schools and hospitals in areas liberated under ""Euphrates Shield"" to encourage the return of refugees, and it was unclear how long the Turkish troops would stay in the zone.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has suggested that the Turkish troops could target a Syrian Kurdish group that Turkey considers to be a security threat in the Afrin region, north of Idlib, once the ""de-escalation"" mission is over.  ___  Associated Press writers Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, contributed.",en,terrorattack,227,['Syria']

Darren Osborne plowed his vehicle into a crowded sidewalk outside Finsbury Park Mosque in north London on June 19, killing Makram Ali, 51, and leaving 12 people injured.

A man was arrested, police said, and is being held on suspicion of terrorism offenses. The attack happened near a mosque, and British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was directed at Muslims.  Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said Osborne had been ""rapidly radicalized,"" adding that his mindset ""became one of malevolent hatred,"" she said during the sentencing, according to the Judicial Press Office.  ""This was a terrorist attack,"" she said. ""You intended to kill.""  Speaking outside the court, the murdered man's eldest daughter Ruzina Akhtar said the family welcomed the verdict while describing the torment they had been through since her father's death.  ""Our father, like the victims of most terrorism, was entirely innocent, which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful and we cannot imagine the trauma he felt in the last few minutes,"" she said in a statement.  ""But we will choose to remember our father with happier thoughts. He will never be forgotten, he will always stay in our hearts, his laughter will echo the walls of our home, his smile will be reflected in our eyes, his memories will be alive in our conversations.""  'Motivated by anger'  Osborne appeared to have been motivated by anger over Islamist terror attacks in London and Manchester, England, in 2017 and a child grooming scandal in Rochdale that involved men of Asian origin, Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London was told.  Flowers and tributes lie at a police cordon near the scene of the Finsbury Park attack.  He rented a van in Wales and drove it to London on June 18 planning to attack people attending a march, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement after the verdict.  When that did not prove possible, he drove around the city looking for a mosque, it said.  Just after midnight, he saw a group of men helping Ali, who had collapsed at an intersection. More people were around than usual because it was Ramadan, and many Muslims were on their way to or from prayers, the CPS said.  According to the prosecution, Osborne deliberately drove his vehicle into the group near Finsbury Park Mosque, fatally injuring Ali and trying to kill as many others as he could. Nine others were taken to the hospital with injuries suffered in the attack.  Darren Osbourne was convicted of murder and attempted murder.  A witness told the court that when Osborne was stopped from fleeing by members of the public, he said: ""I've done my job, you can kill me now.""  In his defense, Osborne claimed that a man named ""Dave"" had been driving the van and was responsible for the attack. But he was unable to explain why closed-circuit TV showed only one man leaving the vehicle, the prosecution said.  The CPS said it had prosecuted the case as a terrorist offense because Osborne's actions were intended to advance a political purpose, expressed in a handwritten note found in the van he used and in comments he made to police officers at the scene.",en,terrorattack,,

Now dozens of patients in northern India are bearing what could be lifelong costs of HIV infection after the medically unqualified man reused an infected needle, officials said on Tuesday, a grim consequence of quacks and unlicensed practitioners filling in the gaps of a healthcare system struggling to meet the needs of 1.3 billion people.  Rajendra Yadav used a dirty syringe to infect nearly 40 people with the virus that can lead to Aids, said Dr S.P. Chowdhary, the chief medical officer for the city of Unnao, where the patients were infected. Authorities expect to find more victims.  ""As of now, he is the one responsible for so many people catching HIV infection. There can be other reasons, but initial investigation puts the onus on him,"" he said, according to the Hindustan Times. Yadav has yet to be apprehended.  Unlicensed people calling themselves doctors, known as jhola chaap doctors, circulate in poor and rural communities in India. Hospitals and physicians can be sparse in the world's second-most populous country, where there is less than one doctor per 1,000 people, below the standard set by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the government said in July.  About a third of those claiming to be doctors had no formal medical schooling, according to a 2016 WHO report. About 19 per cent of them in rural areas possessed the necessary qualifications, compared with 58 per cent in urban areas.  The problem is so acute that the Delhi Medical Council operates a running list of hundreds of unlicensed doctors it refers to as ""quacks"", who are distinguished from legitimate alternatives to licensed medical professionals.  Many Indians rely on folk medicine Ayurveda practitioners and shamans in tribal areas.  Warning signs of infection showed up in July, health officials said, when numerous patients filled local facilities complaining of various ailments. A dozen tested positive for HIV, and another 13 were found with the virus in November, according to the Hindustan Times.  Victims range from children as young as six to people in their 70s. In one family, six were infected.  ""All of them were treated by him in the past,"" Dr Chowdhary said, according to the paper.  Government officials promised action; Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Sidharth Nath Singh said a crackdown on unqualified doctors is possible.  According to the Hindustan Times, officials had an opportunity to blunt the actions of Yadav and halt the infection rate.  The paper said on Tuesday that it had obtained documents indicating a top regional official was notified of the problem in July and did not act.  Chief district doctor Rajendra Prasad received letters of inquiry from Dr Uma Shankar Dixit, the medical superintendent at Unnao, and from Dr Chowdhary.

Violence also flared in the east of Syria, where the US-led coalition said it killed at least 100 pro-regime fighters to fend off an attack on its Kurdish allies.  The clash marked a fresh escalation between Washington, which has threatened the regime over its alleged use of chemical weapons, and Damascus, which labelled the latest incident a ""war crime"".  The United States threw its support behind a United Nations plea for a ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta. ""These attacks must end now,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.  In Eastern Ghouta, which lies east of the capital and has been besieged since 2013, residents had no time to mourn their dead or treat their wounded from the previous day of bombardment.

DOZENS OF CHILDREN  That brought to 228 the number of civilians killed since the regime launched a campaign on Monday of heavy air raids on the area, which has an estimated 400,000 residents.  Among them were at least 58 children, the Observatory said.  ""Children and teachers are terrified that at any moment they could be hit. The siege means there is nowhere for them to escape,"" said Sonia Khush, Save the Children's Syria response director.  ""There must be an immediate halt to the fighting and an end to the siege.""  Moayad al-Hafi, a rescue worker, said his team was targeted as they were pulling bodies out near Erbin.  ""As we were pulling out the children and the dead from under the rubble, they targeted us with five rockets - directly targeting us,"" said Hafi, 24.  At least two civilians were killed in retaliatory rebel mortar fire on government-controlled areas of Damascus, according to state news agency SANA.  AFP correspondents said mortars were raining down on Bab Touma on Thursday night.    Eastern Ghouta was one of several so-called de-escalation zones agreed last year by three of the main outside players in the conflict - Turkey, Iran and Russia.  Ankara announced on Thursday it would host a new three-way summit to revive efforts to end the war, which has killed at least 340,000 people and displaced millions since 2011.  Recent attempts to bring the conflict's protagonists and brokers to the table have floundered, but the UN made a fresh call this week for conflicting sides to halt fighting.  The United States backed the plea but Russia - a longtime ally of Syria's government - shrugged it off.  ""That is not realistic,"" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters at the UN.  US STRIKES REGIME FORCES  A US military official said the US-led coalition that still assists Kurdish-led forces in the hunt for surviving IS members in eastern Syria killed at least 100 pro-regime fighters overnight.  The US Central Command said the coalition acted in self-defence after pro-government forces moved on an area under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.  The SDF and the coalition targeted the attacking forces with air strikes and shelling after ""20 to 30 artillery and tank rounds landed within 500 metres (yards) of the SDF headquarters location"", a US official said.  Syrian state media confirmed that dozens were killed in the clash but appeared to deny the forces were army soldiers, describing the victims as ""popular forces"".  Wounded fighters were taken to the military hospital in Syria's eastern Deir Ezzor city, which is controlled by the government.  A reporter contributing to AFP saw at least six fighters there, lying on hospital beds in sparsely-equipped rooms.  The Observatory said the regime forces may have been aiming to capture of a key oil field and a major gas plant in an SDF-held area.  The Omar oil field, one of the biggest in Syria, had a pre-war output of 30,000 barrels per day, while the Conoco gas field had a pre-war capacity of 13 million cubic metres a day.  According to the Observatory, the forces that launched the attack on SDF positions were local tribal fighters loyal to Assad and Afghan Shiite militia fighting alongside the regime.  In a letter addressed to the UN secretary general, the Syrian foreign ministry said the attack ""represents a war crime and a crime against humanity"".  It accused the United States of trying to set up permanent bases in Syria under the cover of fighting terrorism.  ",en,terrorattack,230,['Syria']
1177340,cnn,Tim Lister,Latest Syria offensives providing a window for ISIS,http://www.cnn.com/2018/02/09/middleeast/syria-isis-opportunity-intl/index.html,9/2/2018 0:00,9/2/2018 22:12,"(CNN) Two major offensives in northern Syria -- one by the Turkish army and the other by the Syrian regime -- are threatening to derail alliances and provide ISIS and other jihadist groups with fresh opportunities.  The Turkish army began Operation Olive Branch on January 20: its goal is to eradicate the Kurdish militia in the Afrin region and establish a buffer zone along the border. The operation has run into determined Kurdish resistance, with seven Turkish soldiers killed at the weekend.  In neighboring Idlib, the Syrian army -- backed by Russian airpower -- is making advances from the south. Much of Idlib is under the control of the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS), a former affiliate of al Qaeda. But remnants of ISIS are have also converged on the area, according to multiple local accounts and the group's own propaganda.  This surge in conflict has jeopardized Russia's efforts to extend ""deconfliction zones"" in Syria as a stepping stone to a broader settlement. Idlib was declared as one of those zones. There's certainly no ""deconfliction"" there at the moment.  The United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria says ""the scale and ferocity of attacks has increased dramatically, resulting in multiple reports of civilian casualties,"" and three hospitals being hit. It is investigating reports that weaponized chlorine was used in the town of Saraqib.  Turkey's 'Olive Branch'  Elizabeth Teoman at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington says Turkish forces and their allies among Syrian rebel groups ""have made slow but steady progress on multiple fronts along the Syrian-Turkish border amid fierce Kurdish resistance and adverse weather,"" and now control a strip some 15 kilometers wide.  Turkey regards the Kurdish YPG, which controls a large chunk of northern Syria, as part of the Kurdish separatist group PKK that has waged an insurgency on Turkish soil for three decades, and sees both as part of the same terrorist organization. While many western governments agree the PKK is a terrorist group, they don't apply the label to the YPG, which has been an effective force in Syria against ISIS.  Turkish officials have been angered by criticism of the Afrin campaign, with Prime Minister Binali Yildirim speaking of ""smear campaigns"" by Turkey's allies. ""If this [NATO] alliance is to persist, you will ignore words of looters, and accredit the words of Turkey, a trustworthy friend,"" he said at the weekend.  The US sees the Turkish campaign as distracting attention from the task of finishing off ISIS. Major General Felix Gedney, Deputy Commander of the joint task force fighting ISIS, tweeted at the weekend: ""Military operations in #Afrin, #Syria are placing @Coalition's #DefeatDaesh mission at risk.""  According to many observers, the YPG's attention has shifted from the ISIS mission towards the 400-kilometer stretch of the Turkish border it currently controls. YPG commanders warn that unless the US-led coalition somehow stops the Turkish offensive, they will be less enthusiastic about going after ISIS and may even abandon positions in Deir Ezzor, where the terror group is still active.  Metin Gurcan, a Turkish security analyst and columnist with al Monitor, says Turkey is unlikely to be moved. Its main objective in Afrin is less the elimination of YPG militants than to show it's a player in Syria -- and to ""influence the strategic preferences of the US and Russia.""  The question is whether Turkey expands its military operation to Kurdish-controlled areas where the US has a presence, like Manbij. US Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert warned at Davos about two weeks ago of the ""grave consequences"" should Turkish troops clash with US-backed forces fighting ISIS, Bloomberg reported  Gurcan says there is a real danger of Turkish-backed rebels and the YPG clashing in Manbij, with neither Turkey nor the US able to restrain their local allies.  Complicating the picture is the possibility that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is helping the Kurds in an effort to combat Turkish influence in northern Syria.  Teoman says ""Assad has allowed the YPG and allied groups to deploy reinforcements to Afrin through regime-held terrain."" And she adds that ""Assad and Iran may be providing advanced weapons systems to the YPG,"" whose use of anti-tank missiles has impeded the Turkish operation.  It's a typically Syrian scenario: 'the enemy of my enemy' is a temporary friend.  But the consequences of the Afrin offensive are broader than the age-old rivalry between Kurdish armed groups and the Turks. It could threaten to further destabilize Syria, taking the seven-year war to uncharted waters, and potentially reviving ISIS in the process.  Where ISIS went  JUST WATCHED ISIS still planning for future after retreat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH ISIS still planning for future after retreat 03:15  For much of 2017, the Syrian Democratic Forces (of which the YPG is the leading element) and the Syrian regime chipped away at ISIS' territorial holdings in northern Syria, culminating in the fall of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor. But several thousand ISIS fighters escaped alive.  Some continue to fight in remote areas along the Syria/Iraq border. US airstrikes last month killed some 150 militants at an ISIS headquarters near As-Shafah, close to the Iraqi border. Those strikes -- just as Turkey launched its Afrin operation -- were guided by SDF forces on the ground, the US-led coalition noted pointedly.  Other ISIS groups have gone deeper into the Iraqi desert. But many have moved to other parts of Syria, according to US officials and analysts.  For the Assad regime, those ISIS remnants are a mixed blessing. They are useful in that their targets include other rebel groups. (ISIS is very good at internecine warfare with rival jihadists.) But since arriving in the provinces of Hama and Idlib in recent months, ISIS fighters have also attacked regime forces, capturing and killing a number of Syrian soldiers last month.  On January 24, the ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency posted a video purporting to show two Syrian soldiers who had been captured in southern Idlib.  Jennifer Cafarella, also at the Institute for the Study of War, told CNN that ""ISIS is advancing into Idlib province on the heels of pro-regime forces, which are not attempting to block its advance.""  Recently, a British jihadist, Lucas Kinney, appeared in a video calling on former fighters to resume their role in the Syrian jihad and urged Muslims in the region to come and fight. It was impossible to identify his location.  Another sign that ISIS has regained its footing is the uptick in its propaganda output. A study by the SITE Intelligence Group shows that in the first half of January there was a sharp increase in the number of ISIS communiquÃƒÂ©s and photo reports compared to previous months.  There may be more opportunities to come. The Idlib offensive being waged by the Syrian army threatens the synchronized strategy of Russia, Turkey and Iran for ending the conflict. They each have different priorities.  Russia wants ""to minimize its costs and losses in Syria in order to avoid jeopardizing Putin's narrative of having ended the civil war, "" according to Cafarella. But Turkey is supporting anti-Assad groups in north-west Syria (in part to block Syrian forces from interfering with Turkey's Afrin operation).  The movement of Turkish forces further south has infuriated the regime and its Iranian allies, which see the zone around the city of Aleppo as their power center, according to Gurcan, the Turkish security analyst.  Russian airpower undoubtedly turned the tide of the Syrian war, but Moscow is struggling to convert territorial advantage into meaningful peace. Its national dialogue conference in Sochi on January 30 was based on the assumption that Assad would remain in power. But the opposition was having none of it, and the conference went nowhere.  Now militant Islamists in northern Syria suddenly have dueling calls to jihad, says Gurcan -- against Assad's forces and Russia and against the ""godless"" YPG.  For the Russians, it's far from ""mission accomplished.""",en,terrorattack,230,['Syria']

The Israeli military said early assessments indicated the jet had been shot down by Syrian fire, but this was still unconfirmed.  It marked the most serious confrontation yet in Syria between Israel and Iranian and Iran-backed forces that have established a major foothold in the country while fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war.  Israel said the F-16 crashed during a mission to strike Iranian drone installations in Syria. It said it sent its jets into Syria after shooting down an Iranian drone over Israeli territory earlier on Saturday.  The military alliance fighting in support of Assad denied any of its drones had entered Israeli air space. In a statement, it said Israel had targeted an air base in the Homs desert that is being used to fly drones in missions against Islamic State.  Such Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorist actionÃ¢â‚¬Â by Israel would be met with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“severe and serious response,Ã¢â‚¬Â it said.  The Israeli military spokesman said Israel did not seek escalation in the region, calling its action a Ã¢â‚¬Å“defensive effort triggered by an Iranian act of aggressionÃ¢â‚¬Â.  IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expanding clout during SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearly seven-year-long war, including deployments of Iran-backed forces near the Golan frontier, has raised alarm in Israel, which has said it would act against any threat from its regional arch-enemy Tehran.  Iranian and Iran-backed ShiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœite forces, including LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hezbollah, have deployed widely in support of Assad. IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military chief warned Israel last October against breaching Syrian airspace and territory.  IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s air force has targeted Syrian military and Hezbollah targets in Syria on an almost regular basis, but its attacks on Saturday appeared to be the most intense yet.  Referring to the downed Israeli F-16, an official in the pro-Assad alliance said a Ã¢â‚¬Å“messageÃ¢â‚¬Â had been delivered to Israel. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I do not believe matters will develop to a regional war,Ã¢â‚¬Â the official said.  U.S. HAWKISH ON IRAN  In Washington, President Donald TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s administration has backed IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hawkish stance on Iran, and declared containing TehranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence an objective of its Syria policy. On a visit to Israel last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called Iran the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“leading state sponsor of terror.Ã¢â‚¬Â  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also expected to visit the region in the coming week to discuss the crisis in Syria and other issues, and is scheduled to visit Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and other countries.  Hezbollah and Israel last fought a major conflict in 2006.  Tensions have also spiked across the frontier between Israel and Lebanon over Israeli plans for border wall, and Lebanese plans to exploit an offshore energy block which is partly located in disputed waters.  Israeli security forces walk next to the remains of an F-16 Israeli war plane near the Israeli village of Harduf, Israel February 10, 2018. REUTERS/Herzie Shapira  The Israeli military said 12 targets, including three aerial defence batteries and four Iranian targets that are part of IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military establishment in Syria were attacked.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“During the attack, anti-aircraft missiles were fired towards Israel, triggering alarms that were heard in Northern Israel,Ã¢â‚¬Â the military said.  Syrian state media reported two separate Israeli attacks.  In the first one, a military source said Syrian air defences had opened fire in response to an Israeli act of Ã¢â‚¬Å“aggressionÃ¢â‚¬Â against a military base, hitting Ã¢â‚¬Å“more than one planeÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Later, state media said air defences were responding to a new Israeli assault and air defences had thwarted attacks on military positions in southern Syria.  Israel said one of its attack helicopters shot down an Iranian drone at around 4.30am (0230 GMT) that had come from Syria into Israel. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In response, the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) targeted Iranian targets in Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â the military said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“MASSIVEÃ¢â‚¬Â ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE  Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said a Ã¢â‚¬Å“substantialÃ¢â‚¬Â number of Israeli warplanes on the mission had come under Ã¢â‚¬Å“massive Syrian anti-air fireÃ¢â‚¬Â, and only one Israeli jet was harmed.  The F-16 came down in a field near the northern Israeli village of Harduf, television footage showed, and one of the pilots was injured as they ejected, the military said.  David Ivry, a former Israeli Air Force chief, told Reuters he believed it was the first time an Israeli F-16 was brought down since Israel began using the jets in the 1980s.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if the pilots ejected because of the (Syrian)fire,Ã¢â‚¬Â Conricus said. It was also unclear at what stage of the mission they ejected, he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“but it is of extreme concern to us if they were shot down.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israel had targeted areas in the countryside southwest of Damascus, near the Syrian-Lebanon border west of Damascus and in the eastern countryside of Homs province for several hours since dawn.  It said another set of raids hit southwest of Damascus, and another struck around the Damascus-Beirut highway near the border with Lebanon.  In Israel, uniformed military personnel could be seen gathered around the burnt and tangled metal in Harduf by mid-morning, with what appeared to be white foam on the surrounding grass. Others knelt in the grass, inspecting pieces of the jet.  Rocket alert sirens sounded in the Israeli-held Golan Heights and in northern Israel. There were no reports of casualties.

In its 4,500-word article, Reuters documented the killings of the 10 Rohingya men in Inn Din village, about 30 miles north of Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State.  The report identified the victims by name and described them as fishermen, shopkeepers and an Islamic teacher. Two were high school students. They ranged in age from 17 to 45.  At least two of the men were hacked to death by Buddhist villagers, and the rest were shot by Myanmar troops, Reuters reported, citing eyewitnesses who are Buddhist  Ã¢â‚¬Å“One grave for 10 people,Ã¢â‚¬Â said U Soe Chay, 55, a retired soldier who told Reuters that he had helped to dig the grave and saw the killings.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Others were already dead.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In January, the military confirmed that 10 Rohingya men were killed in Inn Din by villagers and soldiers. It said the men were terrorists who had attacked security forces, and that the soldiers had decided to kill them because intense fighting made it impossible to keep them in custody.

The villagers told Reuters that the military and the paramilitary police had organized Buddhist residents of Inn Din and at least two other villages to set fire to Rohingya homes, and that Buddhist villagers had participated in the killings of Rohingya in the area.  The government has accused Rohingya insurgents of burning the homes themselves.  Citing unidentified sources, the report said that an order to clear Inn Din had been passed down the military chain of command and that security forces wore civilian clothes to avoid being detected during raids.  Members of the paramilitary police looted Rohingya property, including motorcycles and cows, some of which were later taken by the military, Reuters reported.  None of the 6,000 Rohingya who once lived in Inn Din were still there by October.  The photographs of the 10 victims before and after the killings were provided by a Buddhist village elder who said he did not want to see the events repeated.  Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, the two journalists being held by the Myanmar authorities, had done extensive reporting on the massacre before they were arrested on Dec. 12. Reuters said Mr. Wa Lone had taken some photographs of the mass grave.  Human rights groups have accused the police of entrapping the two journalists by handing them documents. One relative said the two men had been seized so quickly that they did not have a chance to examine the documents.",en,terrorattack,233,['Myanmar']

Syria says its military base came under Israeli fire, and it hit multiple aircraft in response.  ""Massive Syrian Anti-Air fire, one F16 crashed in Israel, pilots safe,Ã¢â‚¬Â IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said on Twitter.  The incident took place after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intercepted an Iranian UAV, which crossed from the territory of Syria into Israel. In response, the Israeli military attacked Iranian positions in Syria. The operation triggered anti-aircraft fire by Syrian forces.  Israeli Ã¢â‚¬Å“aggressionÃ¢â‚¬Â targeted an army base in the central region of Syria, Sana reported, citing a military official. Syrian air defenses struck more than one jet responding to the aggression, the official said.  Images emerged online purporting to show the F-16 crash site and an operation to evacuate the pilots.  IDF spokesman Ronen Manelis earlier said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We identified an Iranian drone UAV which took off from Syrian territory. The drone was identified by IAF systems and was downed by an IAF helicopter. The Iranian drone fell in our territory and is in our possession.Ã¢â‚¬Â He described Israeli operation in Syria as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a surgical action deep in Syria.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Red alert sirens were heard in multiple areas across northern Israel, initially in the town of Beit SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an and later in the surrounding areas and Golan Heights. Local residents told Haaretz that they heard many blasts and reported heavy aerial activity in the area near the Jordanian and Syrian borders.  Syria has repeatedly protested Israeli attacks on targets inside Syria. Earlier this week, Israeli warplanes attacked military targets near Damascus from Lebanese airspace, with the Syrian Army claiming it destroyed most of the Israeli rockets. In January, Israel launched three attacks on military targets in Syria, using jets and ground-to-ground missiles. Back then, Damascus claimed that it shot down one Israeli jet and one missile.  -- RT",en,terrorattack,,

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Israel is seeking for peace, but we will continue to defend ourselves against any attack against us, and against any attempt by Iran to establish military bases in Syria or anywhere else,Ã¢â‚¬Â Netanyahu said Saturday after meeting with top brass at military headquarters in Tel Aviv.  He said had spoken with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about the recent involvement.  IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military launched a Ã¢â‚¬Å“large-scale attackÃ¢â‚¬Â after shooting down the infiltrating drone and struck Iranian targets deep in Syrian before one of its own jets was downed.  The raids hit at least 12 targets, including three aerial defense batteries and four targets that were part of IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military establishment in Syria. The offensive marks IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most substantial involvement in Syria to date.  Israel has issued several stern warnings of late about the increased Iranian involvement along its border in Syria and Lebanon.  Israel called the drone infiltration a Ã¢â‚¬Å“severe and irregular violation of Israeli sovereigntyÃ¢â‚¬Â and warned that Iran would be held accountable for its meddling.  ""This is a serious Iranian attack on Israeli territory. Iran is dragging the region into an adventure in which it doesn't know how it will end,"" Israel's chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, said in a special statement. ""Whoever is responsible for this incident is the one who will pay the price.""  Israel would not confirm whether the aircraft was actually shot down by enemy fire, which would mark the first such instance for Israel since 1982 during the first Lebanon war.  According to Syrian state TV, which quoted a military official, Syrian air defenses struck more than one Israeli plane, and called the Israeli raids that hit a base a Ã¢â‚¬Å“new Israeli aggression.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the drone was ""on a military mission sent and operated by Iranian military forces"" and that Iran was ""responsible for this severe violation of Israeli sovereignty.""  The drone was in Israel's possession, the military said.  Although Israel has shot down several drones from Syria that have infiltrated the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s territory in the past, the attack on an Iranian site in response to SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incident signals an escalation in the Israeli retaliation.  The military confirmed the Syrian target of the droneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s launch components were destroyed.  Iran denied Israel's shooting down of a drone, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasem calling the account ""ridiculous,"" while the joint operations room for the Syrian military and its allies insisted the drone had not violated Israeli airspace and was on a regular mission gathering intelligence on Islamic State militants.  Iranian involvement along IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s border in Syria and Lebanon has been a growing concern as it fears Iran could use the region to position attacks or develop a land route from the country to Lebanon in an effort to deliver weapons to Hezbollah more efficiently.  But Israel has refrained from striking Iranian sites directly. Syria has also repeatedly said it will respond to Israeli airstrikes but has rarely returned fire. Both of those trends came to an abrupt end Saturday as a rapid escalation played out in the early morning hours.  Israel's chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, said Israel held Iran directly responsible for the incident.  ""This is a serious Iranian attack on Israeli territory. Iran is dragging the region into an adventure in which it doesn't know how it will end,"" he said in a special statement. ""Whoever is responsible for this incident is the one who will pay the price.""  However, the joint operations room for the Syrian military and its allies denied the drone violated Israeli airspace, saying it was on a regular mission gathering intelligence on Islamic State militants.  Russia, which backs Assad and maintains a large military presence in the country, called for restraint and appeared to criticize Israel's actions.

On January 20, Turkey launched a military operation against the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia in the Afrin region, backing Syrian rebels with air strikes and ground troops.  ""At this stage, we can say that one out of two helicopters was downed. We have two martyrs,"" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said in televised remarks.  The Turkish military later said nine more soldiers were killed in separate incidents but did not give details.  Another 11 soldiers were injured after the offensive's bloodiest day for Turkish military personnel, the army said.  Yildirim said the helicopter was on a mission in the Afrin region as part of Ankara's offensive dubbed Operation ""Olive Branch"".  Ankara says the YPG is a ""terrorist"" offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey and is blacklisted by Washington and the European Union.  Mustefa Bali, spokesman for the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces dominated by the YPG, said on Twitter that a helicopter had been hit in the Rajo area of northwest Afrin, near the Turkish border.  But the state-run news agency Anadolu said the incident happened in the southern border province of Hatay, with the private Dogan news agency saying authorities were trying to reach the wreckage in the Kirikhan district.  Earlier, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a helicopter had been shot down without saying who was responsible.  ""Of course, these kinds of things will happen. We are in a war. We will have losses, but we will cause the other side to have losses as well,"" he said in a televised speech, vowing to make the perpetrators pay ""a much heavier price"".  'Threat to Turkey'  The Turkish military said one of its helicopters crashed at 1300 (1000 GMT) killing two military personnel but did not give a reason for the incident, only saying that an investigation had been launched.  Last Saturday, seven Turkish troops died in the second worst single-day loss of the operation so far, with five killed in a tank attack.  Some 1,141 ""terrorists"" had been neutralized during the operation, Erdogan said, referring to those killed but also those captured or wounded.  It was not immediately possible to verify this figure.  Yildirim earlier said Turkey had not launched its operation in Afrin to enter into a war or because it had ""an eye"" on another country's territory.  ""Excuse me but no state would ignore a terror organization growing like a tumor next to it,"" he said.  ""This is a threat to Turkey which Ankara has the natural right to fight under international and domestic law,"" Yildirim added. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,230,['Syria']

The Syrian regime used a Russian made S-200 anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down an American made F-16I retaliating to the intrusion of an Iranian made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Most importantly, however, these developments gave Israel a reality check that it has no allies in this tug of war next door.  While the exchange of fire was described as unprecedented, it was not an unusual pattern. Hezbollah has been flying drones over Israel since 2012 and Israel has been repeatedly targeting both the Syrian regime and the Iranian arms shipment to the Lebanese group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Moscow on January 29 and his cabinet met in the Golan Heights on February 7, which were indications that Israel was considering air attacks. What's unique though about the latest confrontation is the Syrian regime's retaliation and its accidental ability to incapacitate the Israeli F-16, which raised questions whether new rules of engagement are being set. The short answer is no, here's why.  The dynamics that set the context of these air attacks persist. Israel remains the leading opposition against the US-Russian agreement in Syria reached last July. These air attacks were a message to Washington and Moscow as much as they were to Iran. It is also increasingly obvious that Israel goes to Moscow, not Washington, on all issues related to Syria, including when launching air attacks. Israel can often push the envelope but will not risk a political clash in Syria with both the US and Russia.  {articleGUID}  The fact is the US and Israeli interests are not aligned in Syria since 2014, when former President Barack Obama Administration decided to coexist with Iran in parallel battles against the so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The Pentagon, under President Donald Trump, maintained this tacit understanding and reaffirmed the top priority of protecting US troops and long-term interests in northern Syria. In return, Israel's top priority is to prevent Iran from establishing a permanent presence in Syria and a supply line to Lebanon.  Meanwhile, Russia remains until further notice the kingmaker in Syria. While Iran and Israel are trading threats, we are not entering a ""new strategic era"", as Hezbollah has claimed. There is no deterrence between an Iranian made drone and an American made F-16, both in the Syrian air with Russian consent. In November 2016, Russia has repaired the Syrian S-200 to operational status, which practically means that no missile can likely be launched without prior knowledge from Moscow, most notably if the target was Israel. Russia's latest intricate balance between allowing Israel to launch air attacks and the Syrian regime to respond is a dangerous game that solidifies Moscow's powerbroker status.  Both Israel and Iran gained from that brief confrontation as they maneuver their psychological and intelligence wars. Israel managed to shift attention to the issue of deterring Iran as the US and Russia are preoccupied with Turkey, the second neighbouring country seeking to alter the Syrian status quo.  Iran has flexed its muscles in Syria but achieved no strategic objective. Netanyahu, who is battling serious corruption charges, cannot find a better scenario to show how invaluable he is to Israeli politics. The Syrian regime gained a needed propaganda tool about its fighting capabilities to prop up the base and distract from the military operations in the outskirts of Damascus. Beyond that, nothing has changed on the ground. The reason why it is the first time in 36 years an advanced Israeli weaponry was shot down is that Israel did not confront a traditional Arab military since 1982.  This latest turmoil also reminded Israel it has no allies in Syria nor control over developments. The Kremlin urged Israel to deescalate tensions while the White House's message to Iran was to merely ""cease provocative actions and work toward regional peace"". The US has been asking Israel to rein in its rhetoric against Lebanon and to show restraints in Syria. However, the Israeli cabinet's rational on February 11 was ""we will continue to harm anyone who tries to harm us"", a rule of retaliation that can only go so far.  Indeed, uncertainty in Syria is making Israel anxious. Netanyahu's end goal seems to be making amendments to the US-Russian agreement and creating a wedge between Iran and the Syrian regime, which are both improbable outcomes. There are no indications that a full-fledged war between Iran and Israel is feasible in the short and medium term. However, the risks are high in the long term, as the dominant powers turn the page of their proxy wars and begin to rethink their postures in Syria.

The Health Sciences Authority has approved human trials here of the antibody known as Tyzivumab.  The clinical trial, which is billed as a world's first, is administered by healthcare group SingHealth and overseen by the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI).  It comes after nine months of development by Tychan, a Singapore clinical-stage biotechnology company, in partnership with WuXi Biologics, which is based in China.  ""The current paradigm of taking years to bring a drug from discovery to the clinic does not allow us to effectively deal with outbreaks of emerging diseases,"" said Mr Teo Ming Kian, chairman of Tychan.  ""To make a difference to outbreak interventions, research discovery must be translated into medicines within such timelines. The development of Tyzivumab is a first step in this direction,"" he added.  About 24 healthy volunteers will take part in the first phase of the clinical trial, said Tychan, with two more phases likely to follow.  FAST TRACK The current paradigm of taking years to bring a drug from discovery to the clinic does not allow us to effectively deal with outbreaks of emerging diseases. To make a difference to outbreak interventions, research discovery must be translated into medicines within such timelines. The development of Tyzivumab is a first step in this direction. MR TEO MING KIAN, chairman of Tychan, on Tyzivumab being approved for human trial after nine months of development.  The antibody works by stopping the virus from fusing with a person's cells and replicating itself.  It has been proven safe and effective in animals, said Tychan in a media release last week.  The first case of locally transmitted Zika here was reported in August 2016 and by the end of that year, about 450 people had been infected.  The number of Zika cases has been low in the past year, with one case reported last month.  While the symptoms are usually mild, the virus has been linked to neurological complications such as microcephaly in babies born to women who contracted Zika during their pregnancy.  Nevertheless, Associate Professor Teoh Yee Leong, a public health physician and chief executive of SCRI, said: ""It is very important for us to have a potential Zika therapeutics in the future to tackle the threat of Zika infection.""  Singapore is at risk of Zika transmissions because of the presence of Aedes mosquitoes, the vector for such transmissions.  These mosquitoes also transmit dengue fever.  The drug development process is generally quite long and it could take many years before a new drug can be made available to the public.  But if this potential Zika therapeutics is successful, it would definitely be impactful to the medical community as this would be the first time a treatment for Zika is available, said Prof Teoh.  Currently, there is no specific treatment for Zika infection other than supportive management.",en,diseas,,

No U.S.-led coalition or coalition-backed local forces were killed in the strike by a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone, which took place near Al Tabiyeh, Syria, on Sunday.  Lieutenant General Jeffrey Harrigian, top U.S. Air Force general in the Middle East, declined in a briefing with reporters to speculate on who was driving the tank. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least two pro-Syrian government forces were killed.  The U.S. military said it destroyed the tank after it moved within firing range of the U.S.-backed forces while being supported by artillery fire.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis played down the incident, saying: ""This could just be a local couple of guys doing something. I don't want to dignify it as a big attack.""  The strike came less than a week after a major clash with pro-Syrian government forces and coalition forces overnight between Feb. 7 and 8 that may have left 100 or more of the pro-Syrian government personnel dead.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The U.S.-led coalition said it repelled that attack near the Euphrates River by hundreds of troops aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who were backed by artillery, tanks, multiple-launch rocket systems and mortars.  Harrigian said the U.S. forces on the ground called in coalition strikes for more than three hours, involving not just F-15E fighter jets but MQ-9 drones, B-52 bombers, AC-130 gunships and AH-64 Apache helicopters to fire munitions and conduct strafing runs.  ""As the hostile forces turned west and retreated, we ceased fire,"" he said.  The incident underscored the potential for further conflict in Syria's oil-rich east, where the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias holds swathes of land after its offensive against Islamic State.  Assad, who is supported by Russia and by Shi'ite militias backed by Iran, has said he wants to take back every inch of Syria.  Harrigian and other U.S. officials have declined to say which forces were responsible for last week's larger attack.  The Kremlin said on Tuesday it had no information about Russian mercenaries reportedly being killed in last week's attack.  The U.S.-led coalition was set up in 2014 to battle Islamic State fighters in both Syria and Iraq, which were largely defeated last year. Some 2,000 U.S. forces remain on the ground in Syria, allied to the Kurdish-led SDF alliance, which holds the largest swath of territory still outside the control of the government.  The Syrian civil war, now entering its eighth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes, while drawing in regional countries and global powers supporting client factions on the ground.

1220441,cnn,Analysis Ben Wedeman,Tillerson's Middle East tour: messenger without a message,https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/middleeast/ben-wedeman-rex-tillerson-mideast-intl/index.html,15/2/2018 0:00,15/2/2018 20:36,"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) If President Donald Trump was out to punish his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, he's found just the thing.  The job of trying to sort all this out has fallen to an oil executive with no diplomatic experience leading a State Department hemorrhaging experienced staff, and to the president's 37-year-old son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a political neophyte well-versed in the murky world of Manhattan real estate, and not much else.  Tillerson's swing through the region takes him to Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. And if there was any doubt about shrinking American influence in the region, this whirlwind tour is making it abundantly clear.  Egypt  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, left, meets Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, in Cairo, Egypt.  His first stop, Egypt, underscored the questionable fruits of the budding bromance between Field Marshall-turned-President Abdel Fatah Al-Sisi and President Trump. Tillerson's host won a presidential election with a dubious 97% of the vote in 2014, and will shortly run again in another election in which he has detained or intimidated all meaningful challengers. Tillerson mumbled a few words about free and fair elections while in Cairo, but was quick to endorse Egypt's latest offensive against Islamist insurgents in the Sinai and the Western Desert.  At a time when press freedom and civil liberties are in dramatic retreat in Egypt, he made it clear that the Trump administration's priority is the almost 18-year-old and seemingly endless war on terrorism.  Kuwait  Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khaled al-Sabah, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, EU Foreign Policy Chief Frederica Mogherini, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, Afghan Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani and Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa pose with other officials for a group photo in Kuwait City.  Next, Kuwait, where he attended a regional summit on the reconstruction of Iraq after the defeat of ISIS. Baghdad estimates reconstruction will cost $88 billion. Participants managed to raise more than $30 billion in pledges.  The US, to coin a phrase from the Obama administration, will be leading from the rear, coughing up a $3 billion line of credit.  Tillerson took the opportunity to weigh in on the continuing spat between Qatar on the one hand and a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia on the other. The Saudi-led bloc accuses Qatar of supporting terrorism and spreading subversion in the region, and last summer imposed an embargo on the country. Iran and Turkey quickly sided with the Qataris, while the US sent a barrage of mixed signals, with President Trump tweeting that the Qataris were funding terror, while the US maintains, and plans to expand, its airbase just outside the capital Doha, the largest US military facility in the Arab world. Last summer Tillerson tried, and failed, to mediate the dispute. His chances of success this time around aren't any better.  Jordan  Then the secretary flies to Amman, Jordan, where he meets with King Abdullah II, still unhappy over President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. Tillerson, who reportedly opposed the move, will just have to suck it up. The Israel-Palestine file is in Kushner's unsteady hands.  Jordan has long been a faithful ally of the United States, but it's an alliance that now comes with a high political cost, especially among the majority of Jordanians who trace their roots back to historic Palestine. In the days that followed the Jerusalem declaration, the Jordanian authorities allowed large and noisy protests in the hopes that Washington might hear, but no one listened.  Israeli forces confront Palestinian protesters in Jerusalem's Old City.  As for the Palestinians, they've made it clear, at least to officials in Ramallah, that they've largely given up on the US playing the role of honest broker. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas flew to Moscow Monday in the hopes that President Vladimir Putin might step in to fill the vacuum left by an American administration seen as the most pro-Israeli in history.  Lebanon  Tillerson will then make the brief flight to Beirut Thursday. As part of the Trump administration's attempt to counter Iran's growing influence in the Middle East, he is expected to urge Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to distance himself from Hezbollah, Iran's main Lebanese ally. But Hezbollah is part of Hariri's coalition government. It played a critical role in crushing ISIS pockets in Lebanon side-by-side with the US-supported Lebanese army. And like it or not, Hezbollah is credited by many Lebanese across the political and sectarian spectrum with making sure ISIS never gained a foothold here. Pushing Hezbollah out of Lebanon's sensitive political equations threatens the kind of instability most Lebanese would rather do without.  A personal anecdote: The other night I sat in a West Beirut bar with a mixed group of Christians and Muslims. ""What do you think of Nasrallah?"" a Christian woman asked me, referring to Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. ""I love him!"" she exclaimed before I could answer, raising her glass of whiskey in salute.  ""He's the designated driver of Lebanese politics,"" chimed in another at the table.  Nasrallah's role in calming the choppy waters of Lebanese politics was highlighted last November when Hariri suddenly resigned under what many believe was pressure from Saudi Arabia, angry over the role of Hezbollah in Hariri's government and their belief that Iran, through Hezbollah, was manipulating Lebanese politics. Nasrallah made a series of television addresses during the tense days after the Hariri resignation, calling for calm. Many in Lebanon credit Nasrallah's stance with preventing a profound schism in Lebanon, perhaps even heading off the outbreak of violence.  Lebanon is a complicated place. Does Tillerson, or his boss, understand that?  Turkey  His final destination, and certainly his most difficult, is Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is livid over American support for Kurdish fighters in the war against ISIS in Syria. Turkey sees the Kurds there as an offshoot of the Kurdish Workers' Party, the PKK, which has waged a separatist war against the Turkish state since 1984.  Smoke is seen billowing from Afrin on January 31, 2018.  Turkey launched an offensive against those Kurdish fighters, many armed and trained by the United States, on January 20 around Afrin, a Kurdish area in Syria along the border with Turkey. The US and Turkey are both members of NATO, but their alliance is in tatters -- indeed, close to its last gasp.  ""Ties with the US are at a very critical point,"" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu Monday. ""We will either fix these relations, or they will break completely. There is no other choice here.""  Not on Tillerson's itinerary, but very much at the center of regional concerns, is Syria. The past 10 days have seen Syrian rebels shoot down a Russian warplane. American and Kurdish forces in Syria killed as many as 100 Syrian pro-government forces, including several Russian contractors, in the eastern part of the country. An Iranian drone was shot down over Israel and Syrian air defenses downed an Israeli F-16.  Never have so many different and antagonistic forces been involved in so much military activity in such a limited geographical space.  The potential for catastrophic confrontation involving global and regional superpowers is huge. Notably absent in all of this is an American role. After the Iranian drone incident, and the downing of the Israeli F-16 and the Israeli airstrikes on Syrian and Iranian targets that followed, the US was AWOL. It could talk to the Israelis, but not the Syrians, nor the Iranians. It was the Russians, in touch with all parties involved, who stepped in and staved off war.  According to the Israeli daily Ha'aretz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone as Israel prepared for a massive counterattack. Putin warned Netanyahu not to escalate hostilities, and Netanyahu complied. The article's author Amos Harel was blunt about what it all meant: ""The quiet after the Netanyahu-Putin call shows once again who's the real boss in the Middle East. While the United States remains the region's present absentee -- searches are continuing for a coherent American foreign policy -- Russia is dictating the way things are going.""  And that about sums it up. Secretary of State Tillerson is, at the end of the day, President Donald Trump's messenger. But he's a messenger without a message.",en,terrorattack,,

KABUL: More than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in violence last year, the United Nations said on Thursday, with militant bombings the main cause while air strikes by U.S. and government forces inflicted a rising toll.  U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a more aggressive U.S. strategy in Afghanistan in August including a surge in air strikes. The militants have responded with attacks in Kabul in the past few weeks, killing nearly 150 people.  The overall civilian toll last year of 3,438 killed and 7,015 wounded was 9 percent lower than the previous year. But the figures highlighted the high number of casualties caused by militant bombs, the United Nations said.  ""Attacks where anti-government elements deliberately targeted civilians accounted for 27 per cent of the total civilian casualties ... mainly from suicide and complex attacks,"" the United Nations said in a statement.  The deadliest attack since the U.N. mission began recording civilian casualties in 2009 was in Kabul on May 31 when a suicide attacker detonated a truck bomb, killing 92 civilians and injuring 491.  Two-thirds of all casualties last year were inflicted by anti-government forces, with the Taliban responsible for 42 percent, Islamic State 10 percent and 13 percent caused by undetermined anti-government elements.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Pro-government forces caused a fifth of civilian casualties with 16 percent attributed to Afghan forces, 2 per cent to international forces and 1 percent each to pro-government armed groups and undetermined pro-government forces, the United Nations said.  The air campaign by international and government forces accounted for 6 percent of civilian casualties in 2017, with 295 people killed and 336 wounded, a 7 percent increase over the previous year.  While ground clashes were the second leading cause of civilian casualties, that toll was 19 percent lower than a record level seen in 2016.  Women and children were heavily affected by the violence with 359 women killed last year, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year - and 865 injured.  The number of child casualties - 861 killed and 2,318 wounded - was 10 percent lower than 2016.  ""Afghan civilians have been killed going about their daily lives - travelling on a bus, praying in a mosque, simply walking past a building that was targeted,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein said in a statement.

The strain was identified in a 68-year-old woman from the eastern province of Jiangsu who was admitted to hospital after falling ill on December 25 but had since recovered, according to China's National Health and Family Planning Commission.  ""She had contact with live poultry before the onset of symptoms,"" Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said late Wednesday after being informed of the case by Chinese authorities, who said the virus genes were of avian origin.  The world's first human cases of bird flu were reported in Hong Kong in 1997, when six people were killed by the H5N1 strain of the virus. Hundreds more have died worldwide in subsequent outbreaks, especially of highly-virulent strains like H7N9.  The semi-autonomous southern Chinese city is a high-risk area for the spread of communicable diseases because of its high population density and busy regional and international transport links.  ""Travellers to the mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms,"" the Centre for Health Protection warned after the H7N4 strain was reported by China.  Authorities in China and Hong Kong did not provide further details on the H7N4 strain found in the woman, such as its virulence. An outbreak of this type of bird flu hit chickens in New South Wales, Australia, in 1997, according to World Health Organization records.

Reuters has reported that about 300 men working for a Kremlin-linked Russian private military firm were either killed or injured in Syria.  The U.S. has estimated about 100 pro-Syrian government forces were killed by U.S. strikes to repel the Feb. 7 attack.  Russian military officers told the United States during the incident that Moscow was not involved. The Pentagon has declined to comment on the exact makeup of the attacking forces and Mattis appeared at a loss to explain the incident 10 days later.  ""I still cannot give you any more information on why they would do this. But they took direction from someone,"" Mattis told reporters flying back to Washington with him from a trip to Europe, according to a Pentagon transcript.  ""Was it local direction? Was it from external sources? Don't ask me. I don't know.""  Mattis said he ""understood"" that Moscow had acknowledged contractors were involved, without elaborating on whether that understanding came from press reports. Russian officials have told reporters that five Russian citizens may have been killed in clashes with U.S.-led coalition forces.  Still, Russian officials deny they deploy private military contractors in Syria, saying Moscow's only military presence is a campaign of air strikes, a naval base, military instructors training Syrian forces, and limited numbers of special forces troops.  But according to people familiar with the deployment, Russia is using large numbers of the contractors in Syria because that allows Moscow to put more boots on the ground without risking regular soldiers whose deaths have to be accounted for.  The contractors, mostly ex-military, carry out missions assigned to them by the Russian military, the people familiar with the deployment said. Most are Russian citizens, though some have Ukrainian and Serbian passports.  The United States and Russia, while backing opposite sides in the Syria conflict, have taken pains to make sure that their forces do not accidentally collide. But the presence of the Russian contractors adds an element of unpredictability.  The U.S. military has said that in its effort to repel the attack on Feb. 7, U.S. forces on the ground called in coalition strikes for more than three hours, involving F-15E fighter jets, MQ-9 drones, B-52 bombers, AC-130 gunships and AH-64 Apache helicopters.  The U.S. military has said the attacking forces were aligned with the Syrian government and were backed by artillery, tanks, multiple-launch rocket systems and mortars.  ""I doubt that 257 people all just decided on their individual own selves to suddenly cross the river into enemy territory and start shelling a location and manoeuvring tanks against it,"" Mattis said.  ""So whatever happened, we'll try to figure it out. We'll work with, obviously, anyone who can answer that question, but I cannot, at this time.""

1245336,bbci,None,Afrin: Kurdish fighters 'strike deal' with Syrian army,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43107013,,19/2/2018 15:44,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Turkey is trying to oust Syrian Kurdish forces from Afrin  Kurdish fighters in north-western Syria say they have struck a deal with the Syrian government under which it will send troops to help repel a Turkish offensive.  The Syrian government in Damascus has offered no confirmation.  Turkey regards the Kurdish fighters, just across its border in Afrin, as terrorists. It launched a major offensive against them last month.  There is currently no Syrian military presence in the area.  A senior Kurdish official, Badran Jia Kurd, told Reuters that government soldiers could enter the Afrin region within days and that they would deploy to some border positions.  The alleged agreement was also reported by Iraqi Kurdish media group Rudaw, which quoted a Kurdish politician from Syria, and a news agency which backs Syrian Kurdish forces.  If the deal has really been struck, Turkish troops could find themselves confronting not only Kurdish fighters in Afrin, but the Syrian army too, says BBC World Service Middle East editor Alan Johnston.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's soldiers withdrew from northern Kurdish areas in 2012.  The Kurds of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) - the dominant Kurdish party - then quickly took charge, backed by its armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG).  The YPG cleared Islamic State (IS) group fighters from wide swathes of Syria.  Turkey is trying to oust the YPG from Afrin because it sees the group as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades.  The YPG denies any direct military or political links with the PKK.  The Syrian military and the YPG have largely avoided direct conflict in the Syrian war thus far but have had sporadic clashes.  ""We can co-operate with any side that lends us a helping hand in light of the barbaric crimes and the international silence,"" Mr Jia Kurd said.  However, he added that the alleged agreement - which he said did not include any political arrangements - could fall through.  ""We don't know to what extent these understandings will last because there are sides that are not satisfied and want to make [it] fail,"" he said.  Northern and north-western Syria hosts an extremely complex mix of alliances between different international and regional players.  According to Reuters, a Kurdish political official said Russia could object to any agreement between the YPG and the Syrian government as it complicates its own diplomatic efforts with Turkey.  The situation is further complicated by the YPG militia receiving funding from the United States, as allies in the fight against IS.

Iran continues to train and equip fighters while strengthening ties with allies in Iraq and Lebanon, in hopes of building a united front in the event of a new war.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ultimate goal is, in the case of another war, to make Syria a new front between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Amir Toumaj, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who studies Iran. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are making that not just a goal, but a reality.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Iranian leaders speak openly of their work to build this axis of resistance against Israeli and American influence. A key to IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategy, analysts and officials say, is to rely not on conventional military hardware or control of territory, which Israel can easily bomb, but on building ties with local forces who share its goals and benefit from its financing and expertise.  That approach has enabled Iran to amplify its power in the Arab world while decreasing the threat to its own forces and homeland. It has also created a problem for countries including the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia, who fear IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing influence but have struggled to come up with ways to stop it.  Some people in Israel have started referring to a potential Ã¢â‚¬Å“First Northern War,Ã¢â‚¬Â meaning that Israel will have to fight across both the Lebanese and Syrian frontiers. And many Israelis say the danger is not just from the new Iranian-backed militias, but also from the Iranian efforts to give advanced, high-precision weapons capable of hitting sensitive infrastructure to Hezbollah, IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful and experienced external force.  Photo  Israeli officials have said that Iran and its allies are seeking to establish a land corridor from Iran to the Mediterranean, via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, to ease the transportation of such weapons and to build underground factories to manufacture them in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has been bombing convoys in Syria that are believed to be carrying advanced arms to Hezbollah, but the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s covert nature makes it hard to determine which arms have slipped through and whether its arms factories are functioning.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Such arms, coupled with heavy barrages from the more than 100,000 rockets and missiles without high-precision targeting capability that Israel says Hezbollah already has, could overwhelm IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defenses.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Israel will face not only quantity, but the threat to vulnerable strategic sites,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and now a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies. Referring to the combination of more precise weapons and a new front, he added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Each one is problematic; together, they are devastating.Ã¢â‚¬Â  IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moves in the region have alarmed the United States. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s particularly concerning is that this network of proxies is becoming more and more capable as Iran seeds more and moreÃ¢â‚¬Â of its Ã¢â‚¬Å“destructive weapons into these networks,Ã¢â‚¬Â Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, President TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s national security adviser, said at a security conference in Munich on Saturday. Ã¢â‚¬Å“So the time is now, we think, to act against Iran,Ã¢â‚¬Â General McMaster added.  In expanding its influence in Syria in recent years, Iran has followed a standard template. In Lebanon in the 1980s, it helped create Hezbollah, which has since evolved into the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s predominant military force and a regional power in its own right, joining the wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. In Iraq, Iran has sponsored a range of militias while developing deep ties to the Iraqi economy and political system.  The war in Syria gave Iran a new opportunity to advance that project by linking its allies across the Levant together.  Fighters from Hezbollah routed Syrian rebels near the Lebanese border and Iran sent advisers to help Mr. AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beleaguered forces during the early years of the war.

But by 2013, Mr. AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces were on the verge of collapse, and Iran intervened more forcefully, undertaking an extensive regional operation to train, arm and transport thousands of Shiite militiamen from abroad to Syria to fight the rebels and the jihadists of the Islamic State.  Estimates of the number of Iranian military personnel in Syria today range from the high hundreds to the low thousands. While some directly participate in combat, most are trainers, commanders or experts who advise the Syrian military and oversee militias. It is these militias, which could have as many as 20,000 fighters, that give Iran its true muscle.  Those fighters include about 6,000 from Hezbollah. Most of the rest of the militia members Ã¢â‚¬â€ who come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan and elsewhere Ã¢â‚¬â€ have been enticed to fight in Syria with money and appeals to their Shiite faith. Indeed, most see the war in Syria in religious terms, as a jihad against enemies of their religion.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Atlantic Council who tracks reports of foreign militia fighters killed in Syria, said the number of deaths reported had decreased substantially as those fighting for Mr. Assad have gotten the upper hand in the war. But instead of leaving the country, he said, the militias appeared to be shifting their sights toward Israel.  Photo  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Iran has realized that it is actually possible to maintain a front against Israel where there is no war but also no peace,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mr. Alfoneh said.  In his research, Mr. Alfoneh said he had identified three main Iranian bases that oversee operations in large parts of Syria Ã¢â‚¬â€ one near Aleppo in the north and two south of the capital, Damascus Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as seven smaller tactical bases near active front lines where Iran and its proxies have a presence.  The idea of a permanent Iranian presence in Syria worries Israel, which fears that it could face a threat there similar to that posed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysts close to Iran and its proxies say that is exactly the idea.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a replication of the Hezbollah model,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ali Rizk, a Lebanese analyst who writes for Al Monitor, a news website focused on the Middle East. Iran is already training fighters in southern Syria, he said, so that if Hezbollah draws down its presence there, as its leaders have vowed to, it will leave behind a Syrian prototype.  In recent months, at least two Iraqi militia leaders have visited the Lebanon-Israel border with Hezbollah, and militia members say the visits have included developing plans for how they might collaborate in a future conflict.  Life has returned to normal in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights since the day of battle on Feb. 10, and the ski resort on Mount Hermon has been operating as usual. There was no immediate sense among Israelis of being on a war footing.  But Israelis and many Lebanese have long worried that another war across their border is inevitable. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ratcheted up the rhetoric on Sunday at the security conference in Munich, warning IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaders not to test IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resolve and pledging that if pushed, Israel would act Ã¢â‚¬Å“not only against Iranian proxies that are attacking us, but against Iran itself.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Both sides say they do not want war, and the fear of extensive destruction and civilian deaths has deterred new hostilities since the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. But the more entrenched IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s allies become, the greater the pressure Israeli leaders could face to launch a strike Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the greater the chances that a miscalculation or mistake by either side could provoke new hostilities.  Some analysts have expressed hopes that Russia, which also intervened in Syria on Mr. AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behalf, could serve as a check on IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ambitions. Russia has cooperated with Iran during the war but also seeks to maintain good relations with Israel.  Notably, Russia has not publicly complained when Israel has bombed convoys believed to be bound for Hezbollah. Others question to what degree the Syrian population will buy into IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideological project, noting that only a tiny portion of Syrians share IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shiite faith.  Much remains unclear about IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intentions. Days after Israel destroyed the drone, Israeli military officials said they were still not sure whether it had been armed, had been sent on a surveillance mission or was merely a test of IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defenses.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is very important for us to understand its mission,Ã¢â‚¬Â Brig. Gen. Tomer Bar, the chief of staff of the Israeli Air Force, told reporters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have to understand it and we will investigate it till the end.Ã¢â‚¬Â",en,terrorattack,,

Air strikes, rocket fire and shelling on several parts of the besieged suburbs also wounded 325 people, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The British-based monitor said the escalation had started on Sunday evening in Ghouta, the only major insurgent enclave around the capital.  There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military. The Damascus government has said it only targets militants.  Factions in Ghouta fired mortars at districts of Damascus, killing a child and wounding eight others, Syrian state media said.

Bekir Bozdag, however, warned any move by Syrian soldiers to help the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, repel a Turkish offensive in northwestern Syria would be a ""major disaster"" for the region.  Turkey will continue its air and ground offensive against the YPG ""with determination until the last terrorist is rendered ineffective"", Bozdag told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting on Monday.  He was responding to a report by the Syrian state-run SANA news agency earlier in the day that said pro-government forces would enter Afrin ""within a few hours to support its people's stand against Turkish regime's attack"".  The report by SANA raised fears of a potential clash between Turkish troops and Syrian forces, which are backed by Russia and Iran.  SANA said the planned deployment followed an agreement between the Syrian government and the YPG.  But a spokesman for the YPG denied agreeing on a deal with Damascus.  ""There is no agreement. There is only a call from us for the Syrian army to come in and protect the borders,"" Nouri Mahmoud told Reuters news agency late on Monday.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops pulled out of most of northern Syria in 2012 as nationwide protests against his rule spiraled into a civil war.  The YPG, part of the US-backed umbrella organisation Syrian Democratic Forces, gained control of large swathes of territory in northern Syria during the course of an offensive against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).  US support for the YPG has infuriated Turkey as it considers the group a ""terrorist"" organisation. Ankara sees YPG as part of the banned Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long bloody rebellion against the Turkish state in southeastern parts of the country.  On January 20, Turkey opened a new front in the long-running Syrian war when it launched a major offensive to expel YPG fighters from Afrin.  Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, speaking at a news conference in Amman, Jordan, said his country would hit back if Assad's forces intervened in Afrin to help the YPG.  ""If the regime is entering to protect the YPG, then no one can stop us, stop Turkey or the Turkish soldiers,"" he said.  Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency on Monday reported President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held telephone conversations with his Russian and Iranian counterparts about the latest developments in Afrin.  Russia's stand could determine how the conflict plays out, said Kamran Matin, a lecturer at the Sussex University in the United Kingdom.  ""A lot depends on the details of this agreement [between the Syrian government and the Kurds] and whether or not Russia is on board,"" he told Al Jazeera.  ""If Russia is indeed supporting this deployment, that means it would act in defence of its ally in case of an attack by Turkish forces on Syrian forces in Afrin. Or more easily, it can close the air space for the Turkish air force to operate, which would make any military operation by Turkey very difficult because it is the superior air force that has given them the edge in Afrin.""

Cases increased four-fold, with more than 20,000 people affected and 35 deaths.  Fifteen European region countries, including the UK, had large outbreaks. Measles cases were highest in Romania, Italy and Ukraine.  People shunning vaccination is part of the problem, say experts.  Although research published 20 years ago about a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been discredited, the scare it created damaged some people's trust of the vaccine.  Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be deadly.  The MMR vaccine can prevent it.  More of our most-read stories:  The WHO says there have been declines in overall routine immunisation coverage, as well as consistently low coverage among some marginalised groups and interruptions in vaccine supply or underperforming disease surveillance systems.  Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, from the WHO, said: ""Every new person affected by measles in Europe reminds us that unvaccinated children and adults, regardless of where they live, remain at risk of catching the disease and spreading it to others who may not be able to get vaccinated.  ""This short-term setback cannot deter us from our commitment to be the generation that frees our children from these diseases once and for all.""  The UK saw 282 cases in 2017, linked to the continuing outbreak in Europe.  The UK recently achieved WHO measles elimination status, meaning that for the past few years the number of cases has been low enough to stop the disease circulating around the country.  The overall risk of measles to the UK population is low, but due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe, cases in unimmunised individuals and limited onward spread can occur.  A few weeks ago, Public Health England warned about measles cases in several regions of England.  At the end of January 2018, there were 51 confirmed cases in the West Midlands.  Image copyright SPL  The vaccine is given as two doses to very young children as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.  Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they have not been fully immunised before.  To prevent outbreaks, WHO says 95% of the population should be immunised. In the UK, coverage was 91.6% among young children in 2016-17.  Measles symptoms include a runny nose, sneezing and cough, sore, red eyes, a high temperature and, after a few days, a red-brown blotchy rash.  Why are measles rates so high?  The main reason behind the sharp rise in measles cases is low immunisation coverage, the WHO says. They say a lack of coverage increases the risk of the virus spreading when it is brought in from abroad.  But some European countries have seen an exceptionally high increase in rates.  Romania is fighting its worst measles outbreak in decades. There were more than 5,500 cases last year, partly due to a shortage of the vaccine and poor healthcare facilities. It is also thought that the country's large Roma population, who often live in severe poverty, are at particular risk of contracting and spreading the virus.  Italy had the second highest number of measles cases in Europe last year.  In recent years, a loose group of campaigners against vaccinations, dubbed the anti-vax movement, has dissuaded Italians from opting in to immunisations by citing supposed risks. In response, the government ruled that children must be vaccinated against 12 common illnesses before they can enrol for state-run schools.  This law is one of the key issues in the upcoming March 4 elections and some people are calling for it to be scrapped.  Ukraine is also struggling with a measles outbreak, with almost 5,000 cases recorded in 2017. The WHO says countries that are experiencing conflict are at an increased risk of measles due to damaged health services and infrastructure.  Measles cases across Europe in 2017",en,diseas,,

The statement did not give a date. Previously the Russian government said ""probably five"" Russians had died in a clash in Deir al-Zour province.  Some reports have said more than 100 Russian mercenaries were killed in US air strikes on 7 February.  Russia does not divulge firm details of ""volunteer"" fighters in the conflict.  What does Russia say?  The latest Russian statement said no Russian regular forces had been involved.  The foreign ministry, quoted by the RIA news agency, described the casualties as ""Russian citizens who went to Syria of their own accord for various reasons"". Some were also from other ex-Soviet republics.  The statement did not specify the numbers of dead or wounded, but spoke of ""several dozen"" casualties, and said the wounded were being treated now in hospitals in Russia.  Who are the mercenaries?  Officially, Russia's military role mainly takes the form of air strikes, helping President Bashar al-Assad's forces.  However, independent media have found evidence of other Russian citizens fighting for the Syrian government side.  Relatives of the hired fighters say they have been paid insurance money by unknown representatives of so-called private military companies, which bring their bodies back.

At least 100 people were killed in one day.  The government's assault on the rebel-controlled suburbs east of the Syrian capital, Damascus, has been a long time coming. Monday's carnage, which continued throughout Tuesday, was the deadliest in eastern Ghouta in three years.  Starved and battered by the government for years, the rebellious area has eluded President Bashar Assad's control despite being encircled and sporadically bombarded since 2013. Now, it appears the Syrian government and its Russian backers have decided to retake the territory at any cost.  Much like rebel-held eastern Aleppo in late 2016, eastern Ghouta is set to become a blood-soaked war theater as Assad tries to bomb it into submission. Tens of thousands of people live there, along with thousands of hard-line fighters, some of whom will probably fight to the end.  Here's a look at the battle for those suburbs.  ___  WHAT IS GHOUTA?  Ghouta is an informal name for the suburbs of the Syrian capital, Damascus, that form around the Barada River, and towns in its eastern reaches, including Douma, Kfar Batna and Saqba. The residents of eastern Ghouta were among the first to rise up against Bashar Assad's rule in 2011. The area was taken over by rebels a year later as the unrest turned into an armed insurgency, then full-blown civil war.  They held on ferociously, determined to preserve the rebel position closest to the capital, denting the narrative of an Assad victory in key places. Today it is the last major opposition enclave in the area, completely surrounded by areas firmly under government control.  Historically an agricultural area, it has been partially besieged by the government since 2013 and completely since mid-2017. The rebel-held suburbs endured a devastating sarin gas attack in 2013 that killed hundreds of people. Over the years, residential buildings, hospitals, schools, warehouses have all been destroyed.  According to the U.N., there are 393,000 residents in eastern Ghouta, many of them internally displaced from other parts of the country, accounting for 94 percent of all Syrians living under siege today.  U.N. aid convoys rarely make it inside, and the lack of access has led to severe food shortages, starvation and malnutrition as well as a sharp rise in food prices.  ___  WHY HAS EASTERN GHOUTA ELUDED ASSAD FOR SO LONG?  Thousands of battle-hardened militants are entrenched in eastern Ghouta, including the powerful Army of Islam group based in Douma, and the ultra-conservative Ahrar al-Sham and Faylaq al-Rahman groups. Haya'at Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel coalition affiliated with al-Qaida, also has a presence in the area.  Despite its proximity to Assad's seat of power in Damascus, Syrian troops stretched thin by the scale of the rebellion overlooked eastern Ghouta for the first few years of the civil war while they focused on recapturing areas deemed more crucial for the government's survival, including Homs, Aleppo and areas near the border with Lebanon.  The militants of eastern Ghouta had years to dig in, amassing an abundant reserve of weapons and ammunition from supply lines that stretched to the Syrian desert. Because the region is a farming area Ã¢â‚¬â€ and once the source of most of the capital's sugar, rice, fruits and vegetables Ã¢â‚¬â€ the militants were able to grow their own food, diminishing the need for supply lines. They've also built a labyrinth of secret underground tunnels beyond the reach of airstrikes. Some supplies get in this way, but utilities have been decimated.  ___  WHAT HAPPENS NOW?  With Russia and Iran's help, Assad has turned the war decisively in his favor, recapturing key areas of the country from rebels and Islamic State militants.  The renewed assault on eastern Ghouta is part of a broader escalation on several fronts in recent weeks as Assad and his allies step up their efforts to finish off remaining pockets of resistance Ã¢â‚¬â€ including Idlib province in the north, which houses many evacuees from Aleppo.  The government has recently sent Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan, also known among his troops as ""Tiger,"" to eastern Ghouta to lead the effort. He has led elite forces to many victories against insurgents since the conflict began, including in Aleppo and most recently in Deir el-Zour against Islamic State militants.  For Assad, victory in eastern Ghouta would remove a long-standing threat and nuisance, going a long way toward ending the seven-year rebellion against him.",en,terrorattack,,

But what a difference a week can make. The war, instead, has reached a new peak. Within the space of a mere few days, Syrian rebels shot down a Russian jet, Kurdish fighters downed a Turkish helicopter and pro-government groups attacked United States-backed forces. Meanwhile, the US killed tens of pro-Assad fighters and over a dozen Russian citizens, the Syrian army shot down an Israeli F-16 and Israel downed an Iranian drone and launched its largest air strikes on Syria in decades. All that happened against the background of intensive regime attacks on opposition pockets in Ghouta and Idlib, which led to the death of an estimated 1,000 civilians in one week alone. No, war in Syria is far from winding down; instead, the last week has demonstrated how it has become a lot more complicated.  The mistake of that hitherto highly optimistic outlook rested on its proponents' sole focus on internal Syrian dynamics, ignoring the emerging secondary conflicts between regional and international powers over the ruins of the country. Foreign powers now dictate the form of the war, according to their own priorities.  How that all began was when the nature of the relationship between local groups - both government and rebel - and their foreign patrons altered, with the effect being to put the latter in the driver's seat in the conflict. The most salient evidence of this came when local groups were pressured to shift their priorities and join in a race between the US and Russia to recapture territories held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in north-eastern Syria. Meantime, the lack of willingness and support from the rebels' backers - because of shifting interests in foreign capitals - made the survival of Bashar Al Assad's regime an unchallenged reality. This has transformed an armed rebellion meant to effect political transition, into a fight simply for survival by the rebels. Seen this way, the war is no longer about securing Syria's future; it is about entrenching the old regime and the great contest of big powers on the plains and in the mountains of Syria.  The end of the military campaign against ISIS was, indeed, the final and decisive factor in this altered environment. Although ISIS still retains pockets of control and is capable of launching asymmetric attacks across the country, the group has lost the vast majority of its territory. Many foreign powers in Syria were thus happy to announce victory over the terrorist group and to adopt new policies accordingly. Consequently, the end of the war against ISIS has ushered in secondary conflicts among foreign powers, who have sought to enforce and/or expand their zones of influence.  For the US, this has revolved around maintaining its presence in north-eastern Syria to stabilise captured areas, improve its leverage for a political transition and contain Iranian influence. The attacks recently by pro-regime forces against US troops along the Euphrates river, in turn, were aimed at minimising that very US influence and stripping it of the resources it controlled. Although the exact make-up of the attacking force remains unclear, it is widely assumed that both Russia and Iran were directly involved. While this incident was not completely driven by foreign actors, the support and encouragement of foreign parties were what allowed it to occur. Just as importantly, it demonstrates a contest between outside interests taking place on Syrian soil.  Away from the north-east, the country is now divided into areas of influence between the key external powers. Some have a physical military presence in their areas (namely, the US, Turkey, Russia and Iran), while other areas are under symbolic influence (namely, by Israel). Attempts to change the de-facto frontlines of those areas can be made either by mutual consent or force. And they are being so attempted. For example, the ongoing Turkish-led operation against Kurdish forces in Afrin is being conducted with the blessing of Russia, which pulled back its troops and lifted the enforcement of its no-fly zone. The battle is driven entirely by Ankara's desire to eliminate the perceived threat posed by the Kurdish-led Democratic Union Party (more commonly known by its Turkish acronym, PYD) along the Syria-Turkey border. Rebels taking part in the Afrin operation are widely perceived as proxies working on behalf of Turkish interests.  And on another front, consider the clashes involving Israel. These incidents between Israel and Iran-backed forces have erupted because Teheran have been attempting to forcibly expand its influence in southern Syria along the Israel-Syria disengagement lines. Israel does not have a military presence inside Syria and has clearly designated its frontlines as no-go zones for pro-Iran militias. The confrontations began after an Iranian drone penetrated Israel's airspace. Israel retaliated by attacking the base from which the drone was launched. In response, the Syrian regime then downed an Israeli F-16 fighter jet. That then provoked Israel's biggest air strikes on Syria in decades. Israel, which has enjoyed a relatively quiet frontline with Syria for decades, is unlikely to have wanted to foment trouble for itself. This implies that Iran may have been behind the recent clashes.  The Syrian war has long been a proxy conflict motivated by internal Syrian dynamics. But recent developments illustrate that it has been transformed into more direct war between foreign powers hoping to create a new order in Syria. These externally driven conflicts will unlikely provoke all-out, direct confrontations between foreign powers, but the deepening direct involvement of these actors and their attempts to play off each other for more leverage means confrontations will continue. In short, the external powers who had earlier been entrusted with the responsibility of ending the Syrian conflict are now the ones fuelling it.",en,terrorattack,,

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday that at least 403 people were killed in the ""hysterical attack"" that began on Sunday, including 150 children. Almost 2,120 others were wounded.  UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, stressed the urgent need for a ceasefire in comments made before Thursday's UN Security Council meeting.  ""The humanitarian situation in Eastern Ghouta is appalling and, therefore, we need a ceasefire that stops both the horrific heavy bombardment of Eastern Ghouta and the indiscriminate mortar shelling on Damascus,"" he said.  He added the ceasefire needs to be followed by immediate, unhindered humanitarian access and a facilitated evacuation of wounded people out of Eastern Ghouta and warned against this being a repeat of Aleppo.  Living under bombardment  Residents of Eastern Ghouta, the majority of whom are internally displaced, say there is nothing they can do and nowhere to hide.  Rafat al-Abram lives in Douma and is a car mechanic. The air attacks over the last few days have disrupted his job as the street he works on was destroyed by two raids.  ""I managed to get some of my tools and equipment out, and fix cars whenever I can,"" he told Al Jazeera.  ""Sometimes I also fix the ambulances of the civil defence, which break down often because of their constant use.""  His wife and two teenage daughters, Khadija, 17, and Ola, 15, remain at home. They start their day by sitting together before al-Abram visits his neighbours to get the latest grim news.  ""Sometimes a bombing takes place near where I am working, which means I have to stop and hurry to help the civil defence pull victims from the rubble,"" he said.  After al-Abram returns home, he says he is haunted by the unbearable scenes he witnessed during the day.  ""Seeing a father or mother wailing and crying over their dead children, or a father carrying his son who has one leg amputated, or another screaming at God and then at people to help save his family who are all lying under the rubble of a building Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I try to comfort them even though I want to sit and cry with them from the horror of what is happening all around us,"" he said.  'Survive or die together'  Rebel-controlled Eastern Ghouta, a mostly rural area on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, has been under government siege since 2013. About 400,000 Syrians live there. The siege has resulted in huge inflation of the cost of basic foodstuffs, a bag of bread now costs the equivalent of $5.  Malnutrition rates have reached unprecedented levels, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, with 11.9 percent of children under the age of five acutely malnourished.  Only one aid convoy was permitted inside the area in February, to the town of Nashabieh, but none were allowed in January and December.  Nisma al-Hatri told Al Jazeera her husband and 10-year-old daughter Sara wake up to the sound of warplanes.  ""Every day goes like this: bombings, then I clean the house from the effect of the nearby shelling, then we hide in one room, attempting to survive or die together,"" Hatri said.  ""My daughter Sara and I wake up with our arms around each other from the night before,"" al-Hatmi continued. ""We all sleep on one mattress. She hugs me and asks me why she can't go out to play, or to school or to see her friends. I cannot answer her.""  The 32-year-old used to be a teacher, but schools were shut down a month ago because the situation grew too dangerous to go outside. Nevertheless, Hatmi still gives lessons to Sara and other neighbourhood children on an almost daily basis.  Her husband goes out every morning for several hours and returns with barley, which Hatmi cooks with rice for their breakfast and dinner. Some days her husband returns empty-handed.  'War against civilians'  Mahmood Adam, a member of the Syrian Civil Defence, described to Al Jazeera the reality of Eastern Ghouta as ""disastrous"".  ""We are talking about a systematic targeting of civilians in their homes, schools, medical centres, marketplaces, and civil defence sites,"" he said. ""This is an extermination of the society in this area.""  ""There are families who have been hiding in basements and underground shelters who haven't seen the sun in days for fear of the brutality of the regime and the Russian warplanes,"" he continued.  ""We don't know whether we will be alive to tell the world what is happening in the next hour or day. The rocket launchers are relentless, and the warplanes have not left the skies of Eastern Ghouta since Sunday.  ""Everyone here knows this is a slaughter and a crime against humanity,"" he added. ""This is a war against civilians.""  Targeting medical centres  Speaking from the Turkish border city of Gaziantep, Al Jazeera's Osama Bin Javaid said doctors in Eastern Ghouta are saying the circumstances are ""beyond words"".  ""What they see is body after body arriving in makeshift clinics,"" Bin Javaid said. ""[They are] trying to give medical aid to the people who are in their hundreds being wounded in a relentless barrage of rockets, shells, and air raids.  ""They are running out of medical assistance and places to put these people because at least 22 facilities, according to the Syrian American Medical Society, have been targeted since Sunday,"" he said.  Ahmed al-Masri, spokesman for the Union of Free Syrian Doctors, told Al Jazeera that government forces are attempting to destroy ""every aspect of civilian life"".  ""The regime's forces are using the most ferocious means of bombardment,"" he said. ""As a result, many of the hospitals and medical facilities in Eastern Ghouta were directly hit and destroyed.  ""Three of our medical centres were shelled and destroyed, and one of our crews was killed and three others wounded.""  No consensus on ceasefire  Meanwhile, the UN Security Council failed to reach an agreement on a resolution put forward by Sweden and Kuwait that called for a 30-day cessation of hostilities to allow aid delivery and the evacuation of civilians from besieged Eastern Ghouta.  Russian UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzya said there was ""no agreement"" and presented amendments to the draft resolution ""for it to be realistic"". He also accused the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, of being ""closely affiliated with terrorist groups"".  The Syrian ambassador to the UN, Basher al-Jaafari, accused the UN and mainstream media of backing ""terrorists recruited by the US from all over the world"" to fight in Syria.  Al Jazeera's diplomatic correspondent James Bays said Jaafari's comments were typical of a man who has ""stoutly defended his government and whatever it does"".  ""He is representing a government that is breaching international law - effectively many would say carrying out war crimes,"" Bays said, speaking from the UN headquarters in New York.  ""He's very much supported diplomatically by Russia.

The UN Security Council demanded on Saturday that all parties cease fighting for 30 days ""without delay"".  But the Syrian government's ally Russia said the truce would begin only once they had agreed how to implement it.  It came as activists reported that nine civilians were killed in a government air strike on the town of Douma.  At least 541 people have been killed by government air and artillery strikes since hostilities escalated eight days ago, according to a medical charity.  The Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel-held area near the capital, Damascus, and has been besieged since 2013 by the Syrian military with support from Russia and Iran-backed militias.  What is happening now in the Eastern Ghouta?  Reports on Monday morning spoke of renewed bombardment of the enclave, where some 393,000 civilians are trapped.  The Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are known as the White Helmets, said nine civilians were killed in a strike on one building in Douma. A monitoring group said the victims were from the same family.  The official Sana news agency meanwhile cited police as saying a civilian had been injured in the government-controlled Qassa area of Damascus by shells fired by rebels in the Eastern Ghouta.  On Sunday, at least 20 civilians were killed in government air and artillery attacks, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), a charity that operates hospitals in the enclave.  Casualties were also reported following what the opposition newspaper Enab Baladi reported was a ground offensive by pro-government forces that rebels repelled.  What has the UN said?  Addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, UN Secretary-General AntÃƒÂ³nio Guterres said Security Council resolutions were ""only meaningful if they are effectively implemented and that is why I expect the resolution to be immediately implemented and sustained"".  He added: ""Eastern Ghouta cannot wait. It's high time to stop this hell on Earth.""  The UN Security Council resolution demanded that ""all parties cease hostilities without delay"" and ensure ""a durable humanitarian pause for at least 30 consecutive days throughout Syria"".  The resolution was agreed to enable humanitarian aid deliveries and medical evacuations of the critically ill, but operations against the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS), al-Qaeda and what the resolution terms al-Nusra Front are not covered by the truce.  Al-Nusra Front was the name of al-Qaeda's former official affiliate in Syria. Its latest incarnation is an alliance of jihadist groups called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).  HTS has a presence in the Eastern Ghouta, but the enclave is dominated by the Islamist rebel groups Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman.  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Monday called on the Syrian government and its supporters to ensure the process of de-escalation took place.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the cessation of hostilities would ""start when all sides of the conflict agree on how to introduce it"".  The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and said it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both the jihadist militants and the mainstream rebels.  How bad is it in the Eastern Ghouta?  One doctor, who gave his name as Dr Jad, told the BBC medics were working with ""no electricity, no medication, no oxygen, bombs, no medication for anaesthesia, no painkillers, no antibiotics"".  He added: ""They are working in a really, really dreadful, difficult situation; it reminds us of the First World War.""  The Syrian Network for Human Rights group, which tracks casualties, says 12,763 civilians have died as a result of attacks by Syrian government forces and their allies in the Eastern Ghouta since March 2011, when the Syrian civil war began.  Was there a chlorine attack on Sunday?  Ambulance drivers reported a chlorine smell after a bombardment air strike in the town of al-Shifuniya.  Workers within the opposition-run health ministry said there had been admissions on Sunday of people suffering symptoms consistent with exposure to chlorine gas.  They said 18 people had been treated ""with oxygen nebulising sessions"", that one male infant had died, and that a four-month-old baby was on a ventilator.  It was unclear whether the boy's death was related to gas or the explosion.  The Syrian American Medical Society, a relief organisation, also told the BBC there were patients ""suffering from symptoms indicative to exposure to chemical compounds"".  None of reports could be independently verified.  Mr Lavrov said on Monday that ""bogus stories"" about the use of chlorine were a ""provocation"" intended to sabotage the UN resolution.  The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons.  However, a joint investigation by experts from the UN and the Organisations for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded two years ago that government forces had used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015.  The experts are also confident that government forces used the nerve agent Sarin in an attack on the northern rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun last April, killing more than 80 people.  - BBC",en,terrorattack,,

Mr Johnson said he hoped Britain and other Western nations would not stand by in the event of a chemical attack, voicing support for limited strikes if there is ""incontrovertible evidence"" of the Syrian's government involvement.  ""If we know that it has happened, and we can demonstrate it, and if there is a proposal for action where the UK could be useful then I think we should seriously consider it,"" Mr Johnson told BBC radio.  Over the past week, Syria's army and its allies have subjected the rebel-held enclave of Ghouta near Damascus to one of the heaviest bombardments of the seven-year war, killing hundreds.  Britain is part of the US-led coalition involved in air attacks on Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but the government lost a parliamentary vote on the use of force against Syrian government in 2013.  Mr Johnson said he supported the US decision to fire cruise missile at Syrian government targets last year after almost 100 people, including children, were killed in a gas attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun.  The United Nations accused the Syrian government of being responsible for an attack that used sarin gas.  ""What we need to ask ourselves as a country and what we in the the West need to ask ourselves, is can we allow the use of chemical weapons, the use of these illegal weapons to go unreproved, unchecked, unpunished,"" Mr Johnson said.  However, he warned there was little international appetite for sustained military action against the Syrian regime.  ""The people listening to us and this programme in eastern Ghouta cannot get the idea the West is going to intervene to change the odds dramatically in their favour,"" he said.

A government source said 16 attackers and defenders died, while other sources reached by AFP from Paris sketched a bloodier outcome, with at least 28 killed.  The coordinated offensive underscored the fragility of the Sahel nation, one of a string of African states struggling with a bloody jihadist insurgency.  Heavy gunfire broke out mid-morning in the centre of the Burkinabe capital Ouagadougou.  Witnesses said five armed men got out of a car and opened fire on passersby before heading towards the French embassy. The car was later seen ablaze.  At the same time, an explosion occurred near the headquarters of the Burkinabe armed forces and the French cultural centre, which are located about a kilometre (half a mile) from the site of the first attack, other witnesses said.

The army's medical chief, Colonel Amado Kafando, said 75 others had been injured.  Three security sources, two in France and one in West Africa, told AFP in Paris that at least 28 people were killed in the attack on the military HQ alone.  French government sources said there had been no French casualties and described the situation in Ouagadougou as ""under control"".  French President Emmanuel Macron telephoned his Burkinabe counterpart Roch Marc Christian Kabore to express solidarity and send his condolences to the families and victims of the slain security force members, his office said.  Macron, who made a high-profile visit to Burkina Faso in November, said the attacks ""illustrate once more the threat weighing on the entire Sahel region.""  Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said damage to the embassy was minor, and the mission would be able to resume normal operations ""in two or three days.""  He paid tribute to the Burkinabe forces defending the embassy: ""It's thanks to the courage of these troops and gendarmes that no-one was hurt.""  'OVERTONES OF TERRORISM'  There was no immediate claim of responsibility.  Burkina Information Minister Remis Fulgance Dandjinou said the attack ""has strong overtones of terrorism"".  Burkina Faso has a history of military-backed coups as well as of militant attacks.  The country is one of a group of fragile states on the southern rim of the Sahara that are battling militant groups.  The insurgency has caused thousands of deaths, prompted tens of thousands to flee their homes and dealt crippling blows to economies that are already among the poorest in the world.  On Aug 13 last year, two assailants opened fire on a restaurant on Ouagadougou's main avenue, killing 19 people and wounding 21. The attack remains unclaimed.  On Jan 15 2016, 30 people, including six Canadians and five Europeans, were killed in a militant attack on a hotel and restaurant in the city centre.  Responsibility was claimed by a group called Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).  JOINT SAHEL FORCE  France, the former colonial power in the Sahel region, has deployed 4,000 troops and is supporting a five-country joint force gathering Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.  On Feb 21, two members of the French counter-terrorism force were killed by a landmine near Mali's border with Niger and Burkina Faso. Twelve French troops have died since the campaign, called Operation Barkhane, was launched in August 2014.

Umar Haque, 25, showed the children beheading videos and other violent militant propaganda, forced them to re-enact deadly attacks on the British capital and made them role-play attacking police officers.  ""His plan was to create an army of children to assist with multiple terrorist attacks throughout London,"" said Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. ""He tried and he did, we believe, radicalise vulnerable children from the ages of 11 to 14.""  Despite having no qualifications and being employed as an administrator, police say Haque used the guise of teaching Islamic studies to groom 110 children into becoming militants at the Lantern of Knowledge, a small private Islamic school, and at a madrassa connected to the Ripple Road Mosque in east London.  Of those children, 35 are now undergoing long-term safeguarding measures involving social services and other authorities. Six of the group gave evidence at Haque's trial, detailing how he taught them fighting was good and had given them training such as doing push-ups to build their strength.  His intention was to use them to attack London targets such as the Big Ben tower, soldiers from the Queen's Guards, a large shopping centre, banks, and media stations, prosecutors said.  Believed to have been self-radicalised online, Haque was inspired by an attack in March last year when Khalid Masood ploughed a rented car into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge, killing four, before stabbing to death a police officer in the grounds of parliament.  He had discussed with Abuthaher Mamun - a 19-year-old who also taught at the mosque - carrying out a similar attack using guns and a hire car packed with explosives. He had made the children re-enact Masood's assault and told another co-defendant the public deserved to be annihilated.  ROLE-PLAYING  ""He tried to prepare the children for martyrdom by making them role-play terrorist attacks. Part of that role-playing was re-enacting attacking police officers,"" Haydon said.  ""He had shown them graphic terrorist videos - beheading videos and frightening terrorist activities overseas. He described himself as a loyal follower to ISIS.""  Haydon said the children had been ""paralysed by fear"" into not telling their parents or teachers, with Haque saying he was part of ISIS and threatening that they would suffer the same fate as those in the militant videos he showed them.  However, Haque's ""ambitious"", long-term plans were in an early stage, he said. No issues had been raised at the school - rated outstanding by government inspectors - prior to Haque's arrest and when it came to light what was going on, police initially met a wall of silence from the children.  ""He shouldn't have been teaching, so that's a concern,"" Haydon said. ""We have had challenges with both the local community and some of these institutions."" Haque was found guilty at London's Old Bailey Court of a number of offences including preparing terrorist acts, having previously pleaded guilty to four charges.  Mamun, who police said was involved in fundraising and attack planning, and Muhammad Abid, 27, were also convicted of helping him. They will all be sentenced at a later date.",en,terrorattack,,

Major Ronald Suscano, spokesman for the army's 1st infantry division, said fighters from the Maute group, the biggest faction in the alliance, had managed to escape before the military retook Marawi City and killed the core leaders, in what was the country's biggest security crisis since World War Two.  The United States last week designated the Maute as a terrorist group.  ""They are regrouping, retraining and recruiting for another attack,"" Suscano told reporters.  He said the rebels broke into smaller groups with some slipping into the capital Manila to carry out bombings.  The Philippines is predominately Christian but Muslim rebels in the south of the country have battled the government for years. Some of them have with links to international Islamist groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.

They were paraded before the media and, according to police, admitted being Maute members, but said they were in Manila to hide, not to launch attacks.  Philippine army chief, Lieutenant-General Rolando Bautista, said rebels had escaped the battle in Marawi with huge sums of cash looted from homes. That was helping to support their recruitment and re-arming for what could be another urban attack.  ""There is still a possibility that they will occupy another city, that is a big possibility,"" Bautista told reporters.  Delays in the reconstruction of Marawi were helping the Islamists to recruit disgruntled residents, mostly poorly educated young men.

At least 68 civilians were killed Monday, a monitor said, while the United Nations reported dozens of trucks carrying aid had reached the main town of Douma.    The government removed medical supplies from the first aid convoy to arrive since the start two weeks ago of a bloody Russian-backed assault that has sparked outrage but little action from the West.  The 46 aid trucks arrived after fresh air strikes hit the shrinking rebel-held zone and regime troops rapidly advanced, seizing around 40 per cent of the region.  An AFP reporter in Douma said warplanes were flying overhead and explosions from further bombardment on the enclave could be heard even as the aid was being unloaded.  The UN's refugee agency UNHCR said the aid convoy had been in the town of Douma for nearly nine hours.  Advertisement  Advertisement  But on Monday evening it cut short its mission and left the enclave, the UN said.  ""We delivered as much as we could amidst shelling,"" UNHCR's Syria representative Sajjad Malik tweeted. ""Civilians are caught in a tragic situation.""  Linda Tom, spokesperson for the UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA in Syria, told AFP fighting and air strikes had continued during the convoy's deploment, ""including on Douma city while the convoy was offloading"".  More than two weeks of air strikes, artillery and rocket fire on the last major rebel-held enclave near Damascus have killed hundreds and devastated towns.    At least 19 people were killed in the town of Hammuriyeh, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Another 49 died elsewhere in the enclave, it added, bringing to around 760 the number of civilians killed since the assault began, including at least 170 children.  At least 15 civilians were killed and 70 wounded in strikes ""believed to be Russian"" on the town of Kafr Batna, said the Britain-based monitor, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.  RAPID REGIME ADVANCES  The UN Human Rights Council on Monday ordered investigators to examine the latest violence and condemned ""the indiscriminate use of heavy weapons and aerial bombardments against civilians, and the alleged use of chemical weapons in Eastern Ghouta"".    Regime troops and allied forces have advanced rapidly across farmland in the east of the enclave in recent days, the Observatory said.  By Monday evening they had retaken 40 per cent of the enclave, it added.  Armed groups there, one of them made up of fighters from Al-Qaeda's ex-affiliate, have been firing mortar rounds and rockets on adjacent neighbourhoods of Damascus, killing around 20 civilians in two weeks.  The offensive has sent hundreds of civilians fleeing from their homes away from the moving front line, compounding a humanitarian crisis and echoing the regime's devastating 2016 assault to retake second city Aleppo.  A suffocating, years-long government siege has forced Eastern Ghouta's estimated 400,000 inhabitants to scrape by on smuggled goods, produce from local farms and rare aid deliveries.  MISSING TRAUMA KITS  Monday's convoy was delivering ""health and nutrition supplies, along with food for 27,500 people in need,"" the UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA said.  But the UN and aid groups said the Syrian government had blocked medical supplies from entering.  Save the Children said the regime had removed surgical kits and insulin, exacerbating the acute lack of medical care in the enclave.  ""Doctors say they have to reuse bandages and needles on multiple patients as there simply aren't enough to go round,"" it said.  ""Some 400,000 innocent civilians are trapped with no food, water or medicine. They must be protected,"" said Sonia Khush, the group's Syria director.  ""The items (removed) included trauma kits and other life-saving supplies,"" Linda Tom told AFP, calling for a solution ahead of a planned Thursday aid delivery.  The United States on Sunday condemned the assault, accusing Moscow of killing ""innocent civilians"" and ignoring a UN resolution calling for a 30-day cessation of hostilities.  EVACUATION DEAL  Moscow has offered safe passage to non-combatants wishing to leave Eastern Ghouta during daily ""humanitarian pauses"", but the UN and the Observatory say no Syrian civilians have left the enclave since the first break in fighting took effect last week.  Damascus and Moscow have accused rebels of preventing civilians from leaving in order to use them as human shields.  French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday urged his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to ""take real and concrete steps"" to push Damascus to accept a truce.  In remarks broadcast on state television on Sunday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said his forces would push on.    ""The majority (of people) in Eastern Ghouta want to escape the embrace of terrorism. The operation must continue,"" he said.  Observers have said a further advance on the ground might spark fresh efforts to negotiate an evacuation to Idlib, a northern province where defeated anti-regime forces from across the country have gathered.

The public acknowledgement of what Col. Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, called an ""operational pause"" is the most explicit sign yet that Turkey's intervention in the Kurdish-held enclave of Afrin is hindering the U.S. effort to finish off IS in Syria.  For weeks, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other U.S. officials have called Turkey's operation a ""distraction"" from the anti-IS campaign. Mattis also has said the U.S. understands that Turkey has an active Kurdish insurgency inside its own borders and that it views Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, to be a terrorist organization. The U.S. says the YPG is separate from the Kurdish fighters inside the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, but Turkey disagrees.  Turkey launched its air and ground offensive in the Afrin enclave on Jan. 20, conducting airstrikes and artillery strikes on a daily basis. It is just one dimension of a complex war in Syria that includes a range of local opposition fighters, extremist elements, Syrian government troops, proxy forces and military units from Russia and the United States.  Manning said that although ground operations against IS in the Euphrates River Valley have been temporarily suspended, U.S. airstrikes against IS holdouts in that area are continuing. He said one airstrike Sunday near the city of Abu Kamal destroyed two IS supply routes.  ""The nature of our mission in Syria has not changed,"" Manning said. He said the Syrian Democratic Forces, which are comprised of Kurdish as well as Arab fighters, remain ""our major partner"" in completing the war against IS in Syria.  Another Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Adrian Rankine-Galloway, said he could not offer an estimate of the number of Kurdish fighters who have left the Euphrates River Valley battlefield to join the fight against Turks in Afrin.  ""They're not fighting ISIS any more, and that basically meant that they're not taking territory back from ISIS as quickly as they had been in the past,"" Rankine-Galloway said.

You probably knew that.  But the way you cover up also matters, and there are plenty of people who have not yet heard the consensus guidance of health officials: If no tissue is available, you should aim into your elbow, not your hand. Even if that means breaking a long-held habit.  ""If somebody sneezes into their hands, that creates an opportunity for those germs to be passed on to other people, or contaminate other objects that people touch,"" said Dr Vincent Hill, chief of the waterborne disease prevention branch of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States.  Germs are most commonly spread by the respiratory droplets emitted from sneezing and coughing. When they land on your hands, they are transmitted to things like doorknobs, elevator buttons and other surfaces people around you are likely to also touch.  Sneezing and coughing into your arm has become the standard suggestion of not just the CDC, but also organisations like the American Academy of Paediatrics and the American Public Health Association.  Even the New York City subway system occasionally runs an announcement asking riders to ""cough or sneeze into the bend of your arm or use a tissue"".  The suggestion is relatively new. The CDC guidance has become official only in the last 10 to 15 years, Dr Hill said.  Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said he began seeing the suggestion more prominently about 10 years ago.  Children are frequently taught in school the proper way to cough or sneeze - sometimes referred to as the Dracula cough, since it makes you look like the count covering up with his cape.  University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine professor of paediatrics Mary Anne Jackson said the term ""cough etiquette"" first turned up in 2000, and she traced the suggestion to sneeze into your arm to 2003, when Sars fears were widespread.  It gained further prominence in 2009, when the H1N1 swine flu pandemic struck the US.  That year, Ms Kathleen Sebelius, then the Health and Human Services Secretary, shamed NBC journalist Chuck Todd for his sneezing etiquette at a White House press briefing. (Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host, later dismissed her advice as coming from ""elitist snobs"".)  To be clear, the manoeuvre does not eliminate all risk, even if it is the best tactic available.  Studies have shown that even masks cannot prevent all droplets from becoming airborne, Prof Jackson said.  But anything to reduce the amount of flying particles helps. And health officials keep coming back to a drum that can never be beaten enough: Make sure you consistently wash your hands.  ""Hand washing is one of the most important things people can do to keep healthy,"" Dr Hill said.  NYTIMES",en,diseas,,

His army -- fighting on multiple fronts amid desertion and exhaustion -- was losing ground. Islamist rebel groups were threatening to cut key routes connecting regime strongholds. And then an Iranian general went to Moscow, and the tide of Syria's conflict began to change, gradually but remorselessly, in the regime's favor.  He had seen at first hand that the war was going badly, despite the involvement of pro-Iranian militia and the Lebanese Hezbollah fighting on the side of the regime.  Soleimani's meetings in Moscow would rescue Assad but condemn Syria to destruction on an ever-greater scale. For the next two years, Russia and Iran underpinned a scorched-earth campaign that broke the back of the resistance but laid waste to Syria.  A Russian rescue  By the late summer of 2015, Assad's forces controlled less than a quarter of Syria. The Alawite heartland around Latakia was threatened; so was the regime-held part of Aleppo, Syria's largest city. Assad announced an amnesty for army deserters and the regime abandoned its strategy of an army ""in all corners"" of Syria to focus on Damascus and a corridor leading to the coast.  Smoke rises after a warcraft belonging to the Russian Army bombed a residential area in the Darat Izza neighborhood of Aleppo.  Russia was also anxious that Assad would be overthrown and that Syria, long an ally of Moscow, would become a failed state, another Yemen. But the Kremlin calculated that a combination of Russian air power and Iranian militia on the ground could reverse the course of the war. And by showing decisive will in Syria, Russia could contrast its own determination to back an ally with US ambivalence toward the moderate rebel groups it had promised to help.  At the UN General Assembly in September 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin said western intervention in the Middle East had been a disaster. ""Instead of democracy and progress, there is now violence, poverty, social disasters and total disregard for human rights,"" he said.  As he spoke, the first Russian combat aircraft were arriving at a hastily upgraded base on the Syrian coast.  For Putin, a Syrian expedition would show off Russian military prowess, safeguard Moscow's toehold in the Mediterranean and outmaneuver the Obama administration. For Soleimani and the Quds force, already active in neighboring Iraq, a bolder presence in Syria would bring closer the Islamic Republic's dream of an arc of influence from Tehran to Beirut.  The Kremlin said its air force would destroy ""terrorist"" groups in Syria. In fact, the targets were frequently moderate rebel groups supported by the United States and the Gulf countries. In late 2015, Russian planes were often flying well over 100 sorties a day. The United States and human rights groups accused Moscow of indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure, especially hospitals.  Syrian pro-government forces walking in the ancient Umayyad mosque in the old city of Aleppo after they captured the area.  A joint operations room was formed and several thousand Hezbollah militia, as well as Iranian Quds fighters, joined the Syrian army to begin to roll back rebel gains in the north and northwest. Possessing few weapons that could take out planes or tanks, the rebels began to lose ground.  The Obama administration -- concerned that more advanced weapons would fall into extremist hands -- had a cumbersome vetting process for groups it supported. Its train-and-equip program was enough to keep a few rebel groups alive but far too little to change the military balance. And its exclusive focus on airstrikes against ISIS -- but not the Assad regime -- infuriated Syrian rebel groups, moderate and otherwise.  The regime also benefited from divisions among rebel groups, and fighting between them, especially ISIS' desire to obliterate all other factions. Methodically, with the Geneva peace process stymied and successive ceasefires failing, regime forces and their allies embarked on a new strategy. ISIS was left alone, and so were the Kurds, who were building a large autonomous region in the north. The regime focused on the spine of Syria -- north from Damascus to Homs and Hama; while intense aerial bombardment of the northwestern province of Idlib kept rebel groups off balance.  By mid-2016, the Syrian army, fortified by Russian-supplied hardware and supported by Hezbollah and Iranian fighters, was closing in on its greatest prize: recapturing eastern Aleppo. A siege of rebel-held areas was tightened; there was the daily terror of barrel-bombs; and once again rebel groups turned on each other. As a photographer in Aleppo told CNN, ""There's not enough food stored for more than a month. If they force a siege for one month, people will die.""  Russia's President Vladimir Putin embraces his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad during a meeting in Sochi.  After the last access to the outside world was closed off, a Russian-mediated evacuation decanted thousands of rebels and their families to Idlib, a tactic that might be described as clear-and-dump and has also been applied elsewhere. In the space of a few months, the population of Idlib doubled to more than two million.  Since Aleppo, the regime has been able to pick off the last pockets of resistance, such as Eastern Ghouta outside Damascus. Assad and the Russians finally turned their attention to ISIS-held areas such as Deir Ezzor, not least because they were oil-rich. And Putin coaxed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan into being part of a plan to create what were called ""deconfliction zones"" -- frequently areas put on ice until the regime could muster the resources to attack them.  In January last year, the chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, said Russian aviation had carried out 19,160 combat missions and 71,000 strikes since the beginning of its involvement in Syria. The Defense Ministry said that over 48,000 service members had Ã¢â‚¬Â³gained combat experience"" in the country.  Pyrrhic victory  The campaign has often seemed like a scorched-earth policy, but it has succeeded in corralling what is left of the revolt, in Idlib and a few other scattered pockets (if you exclude the Kurds and the Syrian Democratic Forces in the far north of Syria). It has also succeeded in radicalizing the uprising, with militant Islamist factions in the ascendancy. The political opposition to Assad, fuming in exile, has virtually no armed wing inside Syria.  Bashar al-Assad has won in the sense that there is no viable alternative to his rule that enjoys broad international support. He has lost in the sense that he now presides over a broken country, whose reconstruction could cost anything from $100 billion upwards. International donors and investors are highly unlikely to venture anywhere near Syria until a credible political settlement is worked out. As Syrian journalist Jihad Yazigi put it, ""Saudi Arabia is not going to put money in a country that is controlled by Iran."" And Russia doesn't have the money.  A Syrian man reacts while standing on the rubble of his house while others look for survivors and bodies in Aleppo.  While Syria's rebel groups are down, they are not yet out. They have years of combat experience, and several have a jihadist outlook that scorns surrender or compromise. Even as their control of territory shrinks, a return to guerrilla warfare beckons.  The regime now controls well over half of Syria but almost all of the border with Turkey is still beyond its reach. Assad is propped up by troops and militia from four countries; those of a fifth (Turkey) are cutting a swath across parts of northern Syria. Above all, seven years of conflict have produced a toxic legacy of extremism, distrust and abject poverty.",en,terrorattack,,
1335311,channelnewsasia,None,Thousands flee in first mass exodus from Syria's besieged eastern Ghouta,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/aid-convoy-enters-eastern-ghouta-10046652,,16/3/2018 15:47,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Syria said a convoy of 25 aid trucks entered the northern pocket of Syria's besieged eastern Ghouta on Thursday.  EASTERN GHOUTA, Syria: Thousands of Syrian civilians fled from a rebel pocket in eastern Ghouta on Thursday, crossing by foot to army positions in the first mass exodus from the besieged enclave since Syrian government forces launched an assault to capture it a month ago.  Men, women and children staggered under the weight of blankets, bags and suitcases as they walked along a dirt road to army lines on the outskirts of Hammouriyeh town. Some wept.  One man carried a baby in a suitcase, the child's head and arms peaking out through the zipper. Others reached government positions in the nearby town of Beit Sawa on wheelchairs.  ""We had been trapped in the basements and did not dare come out, in the cellars and tunnels,"" a man who left the rebel pocket to government territory told Reuters on the outskirts of Hammouriyeh. ""We could not do anything.... There was no food.""  ""There was no water, no electricity, no education for the children,"" said another man from Hammouriyeh, Amer al-Shourbaji.  Another man, who gave his name as Abu al-Nour, told Reuters he had been in contact with people in army territory for days trying to arrange safe passage out.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""For eight days, we have coordinated with the soldiers, telling them we want to get the civilians out,"" he said.  The exodus could prove a key moment in eastern Ghouta, one of the seven-year-old war's biggest battles, in which the fate of civilians trapped in the siege zone has been central.  The United Nations has estimated 400,000 people had been under siege in eastern Ghouta, the last large rebel bastion near the capital Damascus, with little access to food or medicine.  The government and its Russian allies have been pounding the area with air strikes since mid-February and launched a ground assault that has seized much of the territory since last week, cutting towns off from each other.  Fighting has raged on there despite a U.N. Security Council demand for a ceasefire. Moscow and Damascus argue the enemies they target are members of terrorist groups unprotected by the truce. They say rebels are preventing civilians from escaping.  The rebels deny this and say most residents are now fleeing because of the government's bombs falling on Ghouta.  The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict, said at least 12,500 people left towards government territory. They came out of Hammouriyeh and Jisreen, which the army advanced into on Thursday, and other towns nearby.  ""Every hour, over 800 people are leaving,"" Russia's RIA news agency cited Major General Vladimir Zolotukhin as saying.  Moscow has offered safe passage out to rebel fighters willing to surrender the territory, a tactic that has helped Damascus and its allies regain control over major cities in western Syria. The opposition says that amounts to forced displacement.  SPLINTERED  Last week, pro-government forces splintered the rebel territory of eastern Ghouta into three separate pockets. Rebel fighters, who have vowed not to surrender, have been pulling out of some towns in the face of the advance.  ""We have withdrawn to Ain Terma,"" Mahmoud, 23, a fighter with the Failaq al-Rahman rebel faction in Hammouriyeh told Reuters by telephone, referring to another nearby town.  ""The situation is very mixed up. we didn't understand anything at all,"" he said. ""We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want anything other than for the civilians to be safe, and whatever happens to us happens. We don't know what will happen.""  The Syrian army seized swathes of farmland and factories in the northeast of Hammouriyeh, said a military media unit run by Iran-backed Hezbollah, which fights alongside Syria's army.  Wael Olwan, spokesman for Failaq al-Rahman, accused the army in a tweet of storming Hammouriyeh and exploiting the plight of civilians fleeing air strikes.  Earlier this week, small groups of sick and wounded people were evacuated from another zone further north, around the town of Douma, under a deal between the Jaish al-Islam rebel faction and Russia. There has so far been no mass exodus from there.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said 25 aid trucks entered that besieged pocket and headed to Douma, eastern Ghouta's biggest town.  ""This is just a little of what these families need,"" the ICRC in Syria said in a tweet. ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said the convoy, which entered through the al-Wafideen crossing with the United Nations, contained food aid for 26,100 people for one month, among other items.  The Observatory said government warplanes and shelling had pounded the Failaq zone overnight. Air strikes on the town of Zamalka there killed 12 people on Thursday, it said. The Douma town appeared quiet on Thursday while the aid convoy entered.  The army's month-long onslaught of air and artillery strikes on eastern Ghouta has killed more than 1,100 people and injured thousands more, the United Nations says.  The Syrian government and its key ally Moscow say their forces only target armed militants. They have said they seek to end the rule of Islamist insurgents over civilians and stop mortar fire on Damascus.  ""Praise God...the families are coming out to suitable locations to the state's embrace,"" an army officer said on state television on Thursday.  State TV showed interviews with people crossing the front, in which they said the Ghouta insurgents had not let them out before. They were coming through a crossing in Hammouriyeh, and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) would move them to temporary shelters in rural Damascus, it said.  Dozens of people crowded into trucks and tractors waved or chanted as they drove by.  One man cried and thanked the Syrian army in the broadcast. Another from Hammouriyeh said militants had attacked somebody who tried raising the Syrian flag there in recent weeks. ""They fired at him and brought down the flag,"" the unnamed man said.

1337249,thestar,None,Civilians flee as two big Syria battles enter decisive phases - World,http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2018/03/16/syrians-leave-rebelheld-ghouta-for-second-day-turkey-attacks-afrin-town/,16/3/2018 0:00,16/3/2018 23:26,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Thousands of civilians were fleeing from besieged enclaves on opposite ends of Syria on Friday as two major battles in the multi-sided war entered decisive phases, with hundreds of thousands of people trapped in the path of both assaults.  Air strikes killed scores of people in eastern Ghouta, a war monitor said, and weary residents streamed out on foot for a second day, as Russian-backed government forces pressed their campaign to capture the last big rebel bastion near Damascus.  On another front, Turkish and allied rebel forces shelled the northern Kurdish-held town of Afrin heavily, killing at least 27 people and forcing 2,500 people to flee, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported.  The Kurdish YPG militia defending Afrin said it was battling the Turkish forces who tried to storm the town from the north.  The two offensives, one backed by Russia and the other led by Turkey, have shown how Syrian factions and their foreign allies are aggressively reshaping the map of control after the defeat of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate last year.  The Syrian war entered its eighth year this week having killed half a million people and driven more than 11 million from their homes, including nearly 6 million who have fled abroad in one of the worst refugee crises of modern times.  The government launched its offensive on eastern Ghouta a month ago, and Turkey began its cross-border assault in Afrin in January. In both cases, hundreds of thousands of civilians have been trapped inside encircled pockets on the battlefield.  AIR STRIKES KILL 57, CIVILIANS FLEE  Backed by Russia and Iran, government forces have thrust deep into eastern Ghouta on the capital's outskirts, splintering the rebel enclave into three separate zones. The United Nations believes up to 400,000 people have been trapped in the densely populated farms and satellite towns, short of food and medicine.  For the first time in the month since the government unleashed the Ghouta offensive, one of the deadliest of the war, residents are fleeing in their thousands, carrying children and belongings on foot from rebel territory to government positions.  Moscow and Damascus accuse the rebels of having forced people to stay in harm's way as human shields. The rebels deny this and say the government aims to depopulate opposition areas.  The Observatory said air strikes in eastern Ghouta killed 64 people, including 13 children, in the town of Kafr Batna and another 12 people nearby on Friday. It said Russian aircraft had carried out the strikes. Syrians believe they can distinguish Russian aircraft from those of the Syrian army because the Russians fly at higher altitude.  Syrian State TV broadcast footage of men, women and children walking along a dirt road near the town of Hammouriyeh, many of them carrying bags, to escape rebel towns. Some waved to the camera and said the rebels had stopped them from leaving.  Russian news agencies reported that more than 4,000 people had come out on Friday.  A humanitarian spokeswoman for the United Nations in Damascus said the actual number of people who had exited eastern Ghouta so far was not known and neither were the destinations of all evacuees. The U.N. had not observed the evacuations, but was visiting shelters where some of the people were arriving.  The Istanbul-based spokesman for Failaq al-Rahman, the rebel faction controling the pocket that has seen the exodus, has said civilians' safety could not be guaranteed in government areas.  The mayor of the nearby army-held town of Adra, Jassem al-Mahmoud, said around 5,000 people were sheltering there so far and as many as 50,000 were expected, who would be guaranteed food and medical help.  The U.N. children's fund UNICEF said it had response plans in place to cope with 50,000 people leaving eastern Ghouta.  The outflow began on Thursday with thousands fleeing the southernmost of the three Ghouta pockets. Russia said more than 12,000 people left on Thursday.  During campaigns to recover other areas, the Syrian government has taken territory by allowing rebel fighters and opposition activists safe passage out to insurgent-held areas at the Turkish border. Russia has offered similar safe passage to rebels who leave eastern Ghouta, but so far they have refused.  ALARMING REPORTS  The Ghouta and Afrin campaigns have both continued despite a U.N. Security Council demand for a 30-day ceasefire. Moscow and Damascus argue the rebels they target in Ghouta are terrorists unprotected by the truce. Turkey says the same of the Kurdish YPG militia it is fighting in Afrin.  The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Russia convened a meeting in the Kazakh capital Astana to discuss the situation in Syria. The three states last year agreed to contain the conflict on several fronts with ""de-escalation zones"", while simultaneously pursuing own military objectives in Syria.  Turkey wants to crush the YPG which it views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in Turkey. The United States views the YPG as a valuable partner in its war against Islamic State in Syria.  A spokeswoman for U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said it had received ""deeply alarming reports"" of civilians being killed and injured in air strikes and shelling in Afrin, and of the Kurds preventing civilians from leaving.  Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV broadcast footage from the Afrin area showing cars, small trucks, tractors and groups of people on foot leaving the town. An elderly man told the channel he had left on foot at 2 a.m. when shells started falling.  ""There are a lot of people leaving the city as well, and a lot still inside,"" he said.  President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had ""largely solved the Afrin issue"". ""We are nearing the end in Afrin,"" he said.

People walk with their belongings as they flee the rebel-held town of Hammouriyeh, in the village of Beit Sawa, eastern Ghouta, Syria March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki  A new wave of people fled a rebel pocket to army lines in eastern Ghouta near the capital Damascus, as rescuers and a monitor said air strikes pounded the besieged zone.  In the northern Afrin region, people fled as Turkish war planes struck the main town, Syrian Kurdish forces and the monitor said. More than 150,000 people have left the town in the last few days, a senior Kurdish official said.  The two offensives - one by the Syrian army with RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s support, the other led by Turkey with allied Syrian rebels - entered decisive phases this week. Both have shown how foreign backers and their Syrian allies are reshaping the map after the defeat of Islamic StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-proclaimed caliphate last year.  Turkey launched the cross-border offensive in January against the Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters who control Afrin.  In its month-long assault, the Syrian military has marched into much of eastern Ghouta, the last major insurgent bastion around Damascus.  EASTERN GHOUTA  Troops splintered Ghouta into three besieged zones in one of the bloodiest offensives of the seven-year war. Residents came out in their thousands this week for the first time, from the southern pocket around Hammouriyeh town.  State media said 30,000 more civilians reached army positions on Saturday, including some who started leaving the Harasta zone as well in a new outflow.  Men, women, and children walked along a dirt road, staggering under bags and suitcases, footage on state TV showed. Many carried infants on their shoulders or pushed them in strollers. Some elderly people hobbled on wooden sticks.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on Zamalka killed 30 people gathering to leave for government lines in the morning. Damascus and its ally Moscow say they only attack armed militants and seek to end the rule of Islamist insurgents over the suburbs.  The rebel factions accuse Damascus of trying to depopulate opposition towns and deny its charges that they have blocked people from leaving.  The United Nations has said the exact number of people fleeing is not known nor are the destinations of all evacuees. Mobile clinics were open and some people were taken to hospital in the capital, it said.  The governor of rural Damascus, Alaa Ibrahim, said the government was setting up new centres due to the massive crowds.  Residents would go back Ã¢â‚¬Å“in a very short timeÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ibrahim said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“As the army advances ... we will return the citizens to their homes ... then we will continue providing services.Ã¢â‚¬Â  An army officer in charge of arrivals in Adra said authorities had dispersed 25,000 people in recent days across temporary shelters there and in two nearby towns. In Adra, the newcomers stayed in schools, receiving food, water, and medicine, he said.  An elderly woman sits in a wheelchair in the besieged town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh  The officer said boys and men between the ages of 15-60 could Ã¢â‚¬Å“settle their affairsÃ¢â‚¬Â with the state by writing a vow that says Ã¢â‚¬Å“I pledge not to return to armed actions.Ã¢â‚¬Â Some 1,500 had done so in the town, he said.  The state has proposed such settlements before for those who accept the return of its rule in other enclaves it seized with the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias.  Khaled Hamad, a shepherd, said he signed a pledge after leaving Hammouriyeh with his wife and five children on a tractor. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They said now we were within the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embrace,Ã¢â‚¬Â he recalled.  The last few days inside had become so harsh that his family ate their cowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s food, he said.Ã¢â‚¬Â(Now) they eat every hour.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Hamad said militants in Ghouta had fired at his brother, killing him and injuring his sons, for trying to get out.  AFRIN  An estimated 12,000-16,000 people had already left Ghouta before Saturday, while more than 48,000 were reportedly displaced in Afrin, a U.N. aid official in Syria has said.  The Turkish military has pushed the YPG militia back from the border and nearly encircled it with advances on the western and eastern flanks of Afrin town. Ankara sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK which has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We can enter Afrin (town) any second. We can give you the good news any minute,Ã¢â‚¬Â Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told a congress of the ruling AK Party. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Conquest is close. We walk towards that aim.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Turkish air and artillery strikes rained down overnight and in recent days, driving tens of thousands out of the main town by car and on foot, Kurdish authorities and the Observatory say.  Hevi Mustafa, a senior civic official, said people fled the main town to other Kurdish-held parts of the region and to government territory. Many were stranded out in the streets without food, she said.  The Turkish military denied on Saturday it had struck a hospital in Afrin, saying it waged the campaign in a way that would not hurt civilians.  The YPG and the Observatory had said a Turkish air strike on the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main hospital killed 16 people the night before.  Rezan Heddo, a YPG media adviser, and state TV, said people arriving in the nearby towns of Nubul and Zahraa, under government control, received some aid.  The journey was Ã¢â‚¬Å“catastrophicÃ¢â‚¬Â for most residents as they walked dozens of kilometres and slept out in the open, he said.  Inside the town, Ã¢â‚¬Å“there is no water, there are no hospitals,Ã¢â‚¬Â Heddo added. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are civilians under the rubble and no capacity to get them out.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Additional reporting by Dominic Evans in Istanbul, Firas Makdesi in Damascus, and Polina Devitt in Moscow; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Andrew Bolton",en,terrorattack,,

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Units of the Free Syrian Army, which are backed by Turkish armed forces, took control of the centre of Afrin this morning at 8.30 am (0530 GMT),Ã¢â‚¬Â Erdogan said, adding that de-mining operations were under way.  Taking Afrin has been the main objective of TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operation Olive Branch, a deadly ground and air offensive launched on January 20 with the aim of ousting the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia group.  Erdogan said a Ã¢â‚¬Å“large numberÃ¢â‚¬Â of Kurdish fighters had Ã¢â‚¬Å“fled with their tails between their legsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  He added Turkish special forces had deployed in the city.  News of AfrinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capture was also confirmed by the Turkish military, which released a statement saying the city centre was Ã¢â‚¬Å“under controlÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Search operations to locate mines and other explosives are under way,Ã¢â‚¬Â it said.  On Twitter, the military posted a video of a soldier putting a Turkish flag on a balcony.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now the Turkish flag will fly over there! The flag of the Free Syrian Army will fly over there!Ã¢â‚¬Â said Erdogan who was speaking at a ceremony marking the battle to open the Dardanelles during World War I.  As the Turkish operation intensified, more than 200,000 civilians fled the Kurdish-majority city in less than three days and dozens have been killed in the area, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  The monitor said Sunday that more than 1,500 Kurdish fighters have been killed in the two-month assault by Turkish forces and allied Syrian rebels on Afrin.  Most died in air strikes and artillery fire, the group said adding that more than 400 pro-Ankara rebels had been killed since January 20  Ankara sees the YPG as a Syrian offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan WorkersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Party (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey since 1984.  But Washington has provided weapons to the YPG, which it sees as a key ally in the fight against jihadists in Syria and Turkey, with AnkaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military operation hiking tensions between the two Nato allies.  According to figures released by the Turkish army, 46 Turkish soldiers have been killed since the start of the Afrin offensive.

1364449,cnn,Words Sheena Mckenzie Graphics Mark Oliver Cnn,How seven years of war turned Syria's cities into 'hell on Earth',http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_meast/~3/XX7aUMkcTYc/index.html,,21/3/2018 3:46,"Architectural masterpieces dating back centuries have been annihilated. Bustling marketplaces turned ghostly quiet. And basic infrastructure -- hospitals, schools, roads -- has been pummeled into dust.  Syria's civil war, which marks its seventh year on Thursday, has transformed ancient cities into scenes of apocalyptic devastation.  Since the March 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime exploded into a civil war with a dizzying array of fighting factions battling each other, entire neighborhoods have been wiped from the map.  Even in cities were the fighting has officially ended -- such as Homs, Aleppo and Raqqa -- government reconstruction is almost nonexistent, instead falling to civilians to mend the pieces of their broken neighborhoods as best they can.  And with governments and NGOs reluctant to hand money to Assad-controlled Syria for reconstruction, its once-vibrant cities continue to crumble.  Here's a look at the before and after.  Greater Damascus: 'Garden of Eden turned Hell'  Eastern Ghouta's devastated Jobar neighborhood, pictured February 27, 2018.  Founded in the 3rd millennium B.C., Damascus is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities on Earth and the seat of power of Assad's regime. While the UNESCO World Heritage-listed old city has escaped much of the ravages of war, its sprawling outer suburbs have been pounded to near-oblivion.  The rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, on the northeast outskirts of Damascus, is home to about 400,000 people and since mid-February has been the focus of a renewed offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian regime.  Eastern Ghouta is one of the last major rebel-held areas of Syria, along with Idlib in the north. Were the Assad regime to take back control -- as it appears poised to do -- it would mark a significant turning point in the country's civil war.  Before 2009 Now 2018  Eastern Ghouta's Jobar neighborhood (pictured above), on the eastern border of Damascus city, has suffered some of the worst damage.  CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman remembered a very different Eastern Ghouta before the war: ""According to local tradition, the Ghouta, once a sprawling oasis on the outskirts of Damascus, was the Garden of Eden. When I lived in Damascus many years ago, I regularly went with my parents and their friends for picnics there and remember sitting in the cool shade by bubbling irrigation canals, playing backgammon under trees heavy with fruit.  ""Today, it's perhaps the closest thing to hell on Earth.""  Aleppo: Syria's 'commercial heart' broken  Aleppo's Great Umayyad Mosque, pictured on July 22, 2017.  Once the commercial heart of Syria, Aleppo has gone from a bustling city of more than 2 million people -- about the size of Houston -- to a crumbling and bloodstained shadow of its former self.  The battle for eastern Aleppo, particularly in its final stages, was among the fiercest of the war. Thousands died and hundreds of thousands more fled before the regime, backed by Russian air power, recaptured the city from rebels in December 2016.  Some progress has since been made rebuilding the devastated city. Thousands of residents have returned to try and salvage what's left of their homes. Electricity runs most of the day, versus just a few hours during the height of fighting. The Syrian government is also building power lines in the desert between Damascus and Aleppo to make supplies more reliable.  Before 2010 Now 2016  Among eastern Aleppo's worst-hit areas was the UNESCO World Heritage-listed old city and its 12th century Umayyad Mosque (pictured above).  The regime and opposition groups blamed each other for its partial destruction in April 2013.  Homs: The 'capital of the revolution'  A Christmas tree stands amongst the rubble in the Christian-majority neighbourhood of Hamidiyeh, in the old city of Homs, on December 17, 2017.  Once known as the ""city of black and white stones"" for its distinctive architecture, Syria's third-largest city Homs became better known as the ""capital of the revolution"" after mass demonstrations against Assad in 2011.  The government recaptured the rebel stronghold in 2014, following an offensive that destroyed much of the multicultural city's distinctive mixture of mosques and churches, souks and squares.  Almost four years later, the Baba Amr neighborhood that was the epicenter of the rebellion remains in ruins.  ""Our homes do not just contain our life earnings, they contain our memories and dreams. They stand for what we are,"" said Marwa al-Sabouni, a young architect who hopes one day to rebuild her hometown Homs. ""To destroy one's home should be taken as an equal crime to destroying one's soul,"" she told CNN in 2016.  Before 2010 Now 2016  Homs' National Hospital (pictured above) appears to have been destroyed in the fighting.

Raqqa: Apocalyptic scenes in ISIS capital  Syrians make their way along a destroyed street in Raqqa, on February 18, 2018.  Raqqa was the capital of ISIS' so-called caliphate in Syria, and the terror group's last major stronghold in the country before US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) recaptured the city in October 2017.  During almost four years under ISIS' hardline Islamic laws, schools were banned, cultural sites destroyed and the heads of executed residents placed on spikes in the city's main square.  Months after Raqqa was liberated, it remains a scene of apocalyptic devastation. ""Piles of gray concrete rubble and charred, hollowed-out buildings have replaced homes and schools,"" CNN reported shortly after ISIS was forced out. ""You can drive for miles without seeing even a flash of color. The odd tree hanging on for life offers a flicker of brown and faint green.""  Before 2012 Now 2018  ISIS militants bombed the Uwais al-Qarni Mosque (pictured above), in 2014, according to Reuters.  The terror group sought to destroy cultural sites that did not fit its extreme view of Islam, including the ancient city of Palmyra in central Syria, along with the Mosul Museum in Iraq.

The rare Senate vote on Tuesday addressing US war powers aims to shut down US military involvement in Yemen within a month, unless Congress formally authorises continued involvement.  The US military is currently supporting a Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen since 2015.  The vote - brought by a bipartisan group of senators, including Bernie Sanders - comes on a day when President Donald Trump met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  ""If you look at the War Powers Act, what America is currently involved in constitutes a military action. That's pretty clear,"" Sanders said earlier this month. ""If we can establish this principle, it will be a significant departure in policy for the United States.""  Some US lawmakers have expressed concern about the three-year-old Yemen conflict, which has killed at least 10,000 people, led millions to face famine, instigated a deadly cholera outbreak, and caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis.  'Unauthorised war'  The Pentagon since 2015 has provided ""non-combat support"" to Saudi Arabia, including intelligence sharing and air-to-air refueling for its warplanes.  James Mattis, the US defence secretary, last week asked Congress not to interfere with the US' role, warning restrictions could ""increase civilian casualties, jeopardise cooperation with our partners on counter-terrorism, and reduce our influence with the Saudis - all of which would further exacerbate the situation and humanitarian crisis"".  Yemen's conflict is seen as both a civil conflict and a proxy war between regional titans Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Senators Sanders, Mike Lee, and Chris Murphy said earlier this month their resolution would force the first-ever vote in the Senate ""to withdraw US armed forces from an unauthorised war"".  ""We believe that, as Congress has not declared war or authorised military force in this conflict, the United States involvement in Yemen is unconstitutional and unauthorised, and US military support of the Saudi coalition must end,"" said Sanders.  France targeted  Meanwhile, a report commissioned by human rights groups said France may have broken international law by providing weapons and technical help to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in their military operations in Yemen.  {articleGUID}  The report by Paris law firm Ancile said France was in all probability continuing to export arms to Saudi and UAE with no guarantee they will not be used in Yemen.  The weapons exports would likely ""constitute a violation by France"" of the UN's Arms Trade Treaty and the EU's Common Position on Arms Export, said the report commissioned by Amnesty International and French anti-torture group Acat.  A foreign ministry spokeswoman insisted on Tuesday that ""France has a robust and transparent system of controls on exports of weapons of war"".  ""Export decisions are taken under the prime minister with strict respect for France's international commitments,"" she said.  Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of Western weapons and European governments have come under pressure from NGOs over fears their arms could potentially be implicated in war crimes in Yemen.  Norway suspended arms exports to the UAE while Germany said no weapons will be supplied to countries involved in the war.",en,terrorattack,,

On Monday night, at least 16 children and four women were reported killed after taking shelter in a school in the town of Irbin, which was hit by an air raid.  Activists told Al Jazeera that the deaths came as the government bombardment of the enclave resumed following a brief lull.  For its part, Syria state TV reported on Tuesday that at least 35 people were killed after a rocket was fired at a government-controlled area in Damascus.  SANA news agency blamed ""terrorists inside Eastern Ghouta"" for firing the rocket, which had targeted a market in the Kashkoul neighbourhood in Jaramana, a southeast suburb of Damascus.  Eastern Ghouta, which has been under rebel control since mid-2013, has been under a relentless bombing campaign, launched by Russian-backed Syrian forces a month ago.  According to the UN, hundreds of people have been killed as government forces and its Russian allies attempt to drive out armed opposition groups from Eastern Ghouta.  Activists and monitors say, however, the death toll is much higher, with some reporting as many as 1,400 killed.  Jaish al-Islam, one of the rebel groups in the area, launched a counterattack on Monday, activists said.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces have reportedly captured 80 percent of the enclave.  Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon, said that talks between the Russians and rebel fighters were ""happening"", but the renewed bombardment was an indication that negotiations were not ""going well"".  While the pro-government alliance seeks a full surrender, rebels want a ceasefire deal, our correspondent said.  ""They are now in a weak position, and are shrinking in rebel-controlled territories under heavy fire, particularly in the town of Douma Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and Irbin,"" she said.  'War crimes'  Though thousands have fled to various shelters in government-controlled territories, some 340,000 remain trapped inside, suffering from acute food shortages and a lack of medical supplies, the activists told Al Jazeera.  People in Eastern Ghouta have been appealing for international support and for monitors to be deployed on the ground to ensure their safety and protection in case government forces seize more territory in the enclave.  On Monday, Assad visited army posts in the area.  The pro-government alliance considers the latest operation as a victory, Al Jazeera's Khodr said, while human rights organisations express concern over missing civilians.  Lama Fakih, Human Rights Watch's deputy Middle East director, told Al Jazeera that in order to ensure the security of people fleeing from Eastern Ghouta, ""we do need to have monitors on the ground"".  ""No one needs to be reminded of the violations that we have seen in places of detention by government forces,"" she said.  ""From torture, to ill-treatment, to sexual violence and even executions.""  Fakih's statement comes as activists inside the enclave report the arrest of many who attempted to flee to government-controlled territories.  The United Nations human rights chief has said the siege of Eastern Ghouta ""has involved pervasive war crimes"", citing the ""use of chemical weaponry, enforced starvation as a weapon of warfare, and the denial of essential and lifesaving aid, culminating in the current, relentless, month-long bombardment"".  Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein made the remarks during an informal meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday after a Russia procedural manoeuvre blocked him from speaking to a formal meeting.  -Al Jazeera",en,terrorattack,304,['In']

The Senate voted 55-44 on Tuesday against the motion, which called for an end to US military aid to Saudi-led coalition forces fighting in Yemen that had not been directly approved by Congress.  Shireen Al-Adeimi, a doctoral student at Harvard University who is originally from Yemen, said she was ""extremely disappointed"" by the fact the resolution was killed before it could be brought up for discussion on the Senate floor  ""At this point, three years later and so many human lives later, it feels like such a criminal act that they won't even acknowledge this,"" Al-Adeimi told Al Jazeera in a telephone interview.  The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has been a humanitarian disaster. Instead of supplying bombs and refueling capabilities, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that civil war and provide humanitarian help. Ã¢â‚¬â€ Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) March 20, 2018  A bipartisan group of US Senators Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, Republican Mike Lee of Utah and Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut Ã¢â‚¬â€œ introduced the resolution at the end of February.  Later co-sponsored by a total of 14 Senators, the motion sought to invoke the War Powers Act, a law that seeks to restrict the US president's ability to go to war without congressional approval.  If passed, it would have required Donald Trump to withdraw US troops from hostilities in Yemen within 30 days.  The motion stated that the US has provided Saudi-led forces with ""aerial targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and mid-flight aerial refuelling"", and assistance in aerial targeting and the coordination of military and intelligence activities.  ""What we are saying is if Congress wants to go to war in Yemen or any place else, vote to go to war. That is your constitutional responsibility,"" Sanders said on the Senate floor on Tuesday.  He said critics of the motion would argue US troops are ""not really engaged"" in Yemen.  ""Tell that to the people of Yemen whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked 'Made in the USA', dropped by planes being refuelled by the US military on targets chosen with US assistance,"" Sanders said.  Humanitarian crisis  Saudi Arabia launched a military offensive in Yemen in 2015. Its stated purpose was to root out Yemen's Houthi rebels, who had taken over the country's capital, Sanaa, and forced out Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi .  More than 10,000 Yemenis have been killed since the war began, tens of thousands have been injured and another two million people have been displaced.  Living under what has been described as the gravest humanitarian crisis in decades, Yemenis face severe food, water and medicine shortages and a devastating outbreak of cholera, which has affected nearly one million people.  Every house has its own sad story in Yemen now. They don\'t even have time to stop and think about it Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the amount of killing and death is horrible Radhya al-Mutawakel, chairperson and co-founder of Mwatana Organization For Human Rights  At the end of 2017, United Nations officials said ""Yemen remains on the cusp of one of the largest famines in modern times"".  Radhya al-Mutawakel, chairperson and co-founder of Mwatana Organization For Human Rights, an independent Yemeni organisation, said the Senate vote result was ""very depressing"".  ""It was time for something different to be done,"" al-Mutawakel told Al Jazeera over the phone from Sanaa on Wednesday.  She said countries like the US, UK and France have the power to stop the war in Yemen since they provide military and political support to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners, such as the United Arab Emirates.  ""But instead they are fuelling the war by the arms trade and by political support to some members in the Saudi-led coalition,"" al-Mutawakel said.  She said life in Yemen is getting worse by the day and that virtually every Yemeni citizen has experienced the loss of a loved-one.  ""Every house has its own sad story in Yemen now. They don't even have time to stop and think about it Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the amount of killing and death is horrible,"" she said.  ""Most Yemenis are civilians. They are victims of the war, but they are not involved. They want peace; they want this war to stop.""  War powers  The Senate vote was not the first challenge to the US role in Yemen in the past year.  In November, the US House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution that called on US forces to end ""unauthorised hostilities"" in the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.  An earlier version of that motion sought to directly challenge US involvement in Yemen under the War Powers Act, but it was eventually watered down after opposition from both Democrat and Republican leaders.  Rita Siemion, international legal counsel for US-based advocacy group Human Rights First, said US lawmakers are ""really starting to realise the importance of playing a role in deciding where, when and why the US uses military force"".  Under the US Constitution, Congress has the power to decide if the US can go to war, while the president has limited authority to engage in defensive force to respond to an attack, she explained.  In the case of Yemen, the US executive branch has argued that its support for Saudi-led forces does not mean it is engaged in hostilities.  ""What they've said is, we're doing things like helping refuel their airplanes, providing intelligence, targeting assistance, but our forces are not themselves directly engaged in that conflict,"" Siemion told Al Jazeera.  The US' use of drone and missile strikes against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and other groups in Yemen has largely gone unchallenged, however, and was not included in the Senate resolution this week.  US Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, said he expects to present a new Authorisation for Use of Military Force next month, US media recently reported.  The US still relies on war authorisations that were passed in 2001, in response to the 9/11 attacks, and in 2002, to allow for military action in Iraq.  Siemion said any future war authorisation law must include several specific provisions, including clear geographic limits and mission objectives, strong reporting requirements and a commitment to respect international law.  It must also include a time limit on any military action.  ""The sunset clause is really kind of the most critical of all of these so that we avoid these never-ending, forever wars that are constantly morphing,"" she said.  ""[It] means that Congress has to come back and decide what continued authorities are still needed, if any, and make those adjustments.""  Saudi leader in US  The Yemen motion also came up for a vote on the same day Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, met the US president in Washington.  MBS, as the Saudi leader is commonly referred to, began a two-week visit to the US on Monday that aims to solidify the US-Saudi relationship, rehabilitate his country's image and secure investments as part of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy.  Trump and bin Salman ""discussed the threat the Houthis pose to the region"" in their meeting and additional steps to deal with the humanitarian situation in Yemen, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday morning.  The leaders ""agreed that a political resolution to the conflict is ultimately necessary to meet the needs of the Yemeni people"", the statement read.  The US and Saudi Arabia have maintained strong ties for decades.  Last year, Trump announced an $110bn weapons deal with the Saudi government from Riyadh, where he chose to go on his first official visit abroad since becoming president.  For her part, Al-Adeimi expressed frustration that bin Salman is ""going around unchallenged"" in the US, despite being ""the architect of the worst humanitarian crisis on earth"".  She added, however, that it is important for Yemenis to know that the unsuccessful Senate vote doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean the fight is over.  ""The good news is there were 44 senators who voted to talk about thisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ which is substantial, given the cover-up, so to speak, and how little attention this has been getting,"" she said.  ""This isn't the end. We're going to continue. We're going to find ways to bringing attention to this conflict and bringing an end to this conflict.""",en,terrorattack,305,"['Yemen', 'US']"

Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, named long-time infectious disease specialist Robert Redfield as the new director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on March 21.  The 66-year-old health professional has Ã¢â‚¬Å“dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients,Ã¢â‚¬Â Azar said in a statement. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are proud to welcome him as director of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier epidemiological agency.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Redfield, who did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment, will replace Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, a Trump administration appointee who resigned at the end of January.  Fitzerglad, who headed the CDC for roughly six months, resigned over a conflict of interest. Politico first reported that she had purchased thousands of dollars in shares in a tobacco company shortly after she was named the health agencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s director.  RedfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appointment does not require Senate confirmation, meaning he could start the job in a matter of days, according to The Washington Post.  In light of RedfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appointment to the CDC, here are 3 things to know about him.  HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done extensive research on the AIDS virus  While working at the Defense Department's Walter Reed Institute of Research in the 1980s, Redfield began researching the AIDS virus around the height of the epidemic.  At the time, many scientists believed the AIDS virus was only spread among homosexuals. But Redfield questioned this theory, later becoming one of the first researchers to demonstrate heterosexuals could contract the virus as well.  In the 1990s, however, Redfield was accused of misrepresenting data that allegedly bolstered the effectiveness of a new AIDS vaccine. In response, the Army and a Congressional committee investigated his research. Redfield was later cleared of any scientific misconduct.  Around the same time, Redfield also drew criticism from public health leaders for endorsing the isolation of infected soldiers, and for calling for mandatory HIV testing of soldiers and health care workers Ã¢â‚¬â€ even though the CDC and the U.S. surgeon general thought such measures could lead to discrimination and likely wouldn't halt spread of the disease.  HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked to combat the opioid epidemic in Maryland  Redfield, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a medical school professor at the University of Maryland, co-founded the Institute of Human Virology at the school.  The institute is the first in the U.S. to Ã¢â‚¬Å“combine the disciplines of basic science, epidemiology and clinical research in a concerted effort to speed the discovery of diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide variety of chronic and deadly viral and immune disorders - most notably HIV, the cause of AIDS,Ã¢â‚¬Â according to its website.  The institute also addresses addiction issues, the Nature Journal reported. Redfield has been praised for his work to fight the opioid crisis.  As the Nature Journal noted, this makes Redfield an Ã¢â‚¬Å“attractive fitÃ¢â‚¬Â under the Trump administration, which declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency in October.  He was considered to lead the CDC under President George W. Bush  Redfield, who served from 2005 to 2009 on former President George W. BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presidential advisory council on HIV/AIDS, was also considered by Bush to become the new director of the CDC, The Washington Post reported.  Bush chose Dr. Julie Gerberding instead, who served from 2002 to 2009. She resigned after former President Barack Obama was first elected.

The number of human deaths in just three months is alarming, said experts, when compared with full-year figures from last year, when 11 people died of rabies, and in 2016, when 13 people died.  The Thai authorities' measures include sending out mobile vaccinations teams that treat up to 800 stray dogs a day. Meanwhile, emergency response teams are prepped to locate rabies cases, and vaccinate animals within a 1km radius of the infection within 48 hours.  Mr Apai Suttisunk, director-general of the Department of Livestock Development (DLD), told reporters on Wednesday that the department was aiming to vaccinate over eight million stray dogs and cats, the main cause of the spread of the disease. He expects to treat 80 per cent of these by June.  ""Over two million animals within a 5km radius of infections have been vaccinated so far,"" he said, as quoted by the Bangkok Post.  Bangkok and its surrounding provinces Chachoengsao and Samut Prakan have been designated outbreak zones for the virus, which has spread to 28 provinces nationwide.  Experts say a vaccine shortage and soaring canine numbers were behind the outbreak.  According to Professor Sanipa Suradhat of the veterinary microbiology department at Chulalongkorn University, the country's rabies vaccine programme was suspended in 2016 over a dispute about whether local administrative bodies were authorised to supply vaccines.  In the same year, the Food and Drug Administration recalled some stocks after substandard lots were found. The DLD has been dogged by corruption claims regarding the vaccines, which are alleged to have been supplied for the last 25 years by a single company linked to the wife of a senior department official.  ""As a result of that probe and recall... vaccines in stock for the following years were affected even though orders resumed,"" Prof Sanipa explained.  The authorities are urging people to go for vaccinations if they are bitten. ""We advise people to wash the wounds... and get a post-exposure vaccine within 48 hours,"" said Dr Wanthanee Wattana, deputy permanent-secretary of the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority.",en,diseas,,

Described by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave as ""very dangerous and devious"", Ahmed Hassan had his head bowed and his eyes closed as he was handed a life sentence.  He was found guilty earlier this month of the attempted murder of 93 people who escaped when a fireball engulfed a District Line Tube carriage at Parsons Green on 15 September last year.  A jury rejected his explanation that he only wanted to act out a fantasy like the Tom Cruise film Mission: Impossible and convicted him of multiple attempted murder.  The 18-year-old pretended to engage with the anti-terrorism Prevent scheme as he plotted mass murder in the capital, the court heard.  He created a bomb with 400g of ""Mother of Satan"" explosives and 2.2kg of shrapnel while his unsuspecting foster parents were on holiday in Blackpool.  ""It must have come as a disappointment that the carnage you hope to create had not occurred,"" the judge said during sentencing on Friday.  Video: Screwdrivers, nuts and cutlery packed into Tube bomb  The judge said it was ""sheer luck"" that the main charge did not fully detonate, and said he was satisfied that the offence of attempted murder was an act of terrorism.  Hassan plotted his attack with ""ruthless determination and almost military efficiency while pretending to be a model asylum seeker"", the court heard.  The judge added: ""Your intention that morning was to kill as many members of the British public as possible.  ""I'm satisfied you were determined to create as much death and carnage that day as possible.""  Image: A review of Hassan's dealings with Prevent is under way  On the morning of the attack, Hassan left his home and caught a train to Wimbledon carrying his bomb inside a Lidl bag.  He set the timer on the District Line and got off one stop before the bomb partially exploded on the floor of the carriage at Parsons Green.  He was motivated by Islamic State extremism, ""deep-seated hatred"" of Britain, revenge for the death of his father and anger at continued bombing in Iraq, the judge said.  For nearly two years, the highly intelligent college student had lived a ""double life"", he said.  Video: Bomber's foster mum 'betrayed'  Hassan had been shown ""every kindness"" since he arrived in Britain yet harboured ""dark thoughts"" and significant hatred and animosity towards the country that took him in.  The court heard Hassan had arrived in Britain illegally in 2015 and told officials he had trained with IS in Iraq. He was also older than he purported to be.  Hassan was referred by Barnardo's and Surrey social services to Prevent, but kept his murderous plans a secret.  In what the judge said was a ""remarkable act of cynicism"", he used his student of the year award of a Ã‚Â£20 Amazon voucher to buy one of the key chemicals online.  Image: Hassan was found guilty earlier this month of the attempted murder of 93 people  The night before the bombing, his foster father Ron Jones went to find out why Hassan was not sleeping, unaware he was sitting next to the highly unstable TATP explosives.

1385334,cnn,Angela Dewan Joe Sterling Schams Elwazer,French police officer who killed suspected terrorist seriously wounded,https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/europe/france-trebes-intl/index.html,23/3/2018 0:00,24/3/2018 10:29,"(CNN) A French police officer is fighting for his life after shooting a gunman who went on a deadly rampage in southern France, authorities said Friday.  The gunman killed three people and wounded 16 others when he stole a car, fired at police officers and took hostages in a supermarket in what authorities are treating as a terrorist attack.  Interior Minister GÃƒÂ©rard Collomb said the officer, a lieutenant colonel with the National Police, offered to exchange himself for one of the female hostages being held inside the Super U supermarket in TrÃƒÂ¨bes.  When the officer went inside the supermarket, shots were fired. The lieutenant colonel had his phone on, so police could hear his interactions with the gunman, Collomb said. As soon as they heard gunfire, police went in.  The gunman was killed and the officer, identified by a source close to the investigation as Arnaud Beltrame, was seriously wounded.  The Interior Ministry identified the gunman as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, who was known to authorities for minor crimes including drug offenses, Collomb said.  An investigation has been opened into murder and attempted murder ""in connection with a terrorist in TrÃƒÂ¨bes,"" the French prosecutor's office told CNN.  Police have taken into custody a woman who was ""very close"" to Lakdim and ""shared his life,"" prosecutor FranÃƒÂ§ois Molins told reporters at a news conference in Carcassonne.  Police respond to the hostage situation Friday in the southern French town of TrÃƒÂ¨bes.  ""Our country has suffered an Islamist terrorist attack,"" President Emmanuel Macron told reporters. ""We've paid the price of the danger of the terrorist threat in blood for several years.  ""I want to state my absolute determination to the nation to lead this fight.""  The ISIS-affiliated Amaq News Agency said that the gunman was a ""soldier"" of the militant group and that he had responded to its call to attack coalition countries, a reference to the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Amaq offered no evidence ISIS had any contact with the attacker.  ""This attack has been claimed by ISIS, and it is currently being analyzed,"" Macron said.  A local prosecutor said the attack appeared to be ""ISIS-inspired,"" CNN affiliate BFM TV reported. Witnesses said the man shouted, ""I am a Daesh soldier,"" using another name for ISIS.  A BFM TV reporter at the scene said the attacker claimed to be an ISIS soldier and demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam , the suspected mastermind of the November 2015 Paris attacks  CNN could not independently confirm the gunman made the demand. Abdeslam is on trial in Belgium.  France has faced a string of terrorist attacks in recent years, including the Paris attacks and other smaller-scale assaults. The country remained under a state of emergency for about two years after the Paris attacks. It was lifted late last year.  How the rampage began  The violence unfolded when the attacker stole a car, killing one person in the vehicle and gravely wounding another, said Collomb, the interior minister.  The gunman then shot at four National Police officers who were jogging in Carcassonne. The driver tried to run the officers down. One of them was wounded, but he is not in serious condition.  The gunman proceeded to the Super U market. He entered the market, firing his weapon and killing two people. He took several others hostage.  Police found the car, and SWAT teams surrounded the market.  Collomb said a National Police lieutenant colonel shot the gunman after offering himself for at least one of the hostages.  The order of the shots was unclear, Collomb said. Police raided the store after hearing gunshots.  Two others were wounded at the market, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.  ""People were absolutely calm before and never thought that there could be an attack in a town like this,"" Collomb told reporters, adding that the risk of terrorism in France remained ""very high.""  A Portuguese citizen was among the wounded, a spokesman for Portugal's Foreign Ministry told CNN.  French police and firefighters secure parts of TrÃƒÂ¨bes on Friday.  'Totally deserted'  A supermarket employee who fled as shots were fired told BFM that he and about 50 others had been on lockdown in a car park.  Madeline Fuhrman, a witness, said that TrÃƒÂ¨bes had gone quiet after the attack.  ""It's totally deserted now. Absolutely every shop is closed. There's not a soul in sight,"" she said.  Macron, who was in Belgium for a summit of European Union leaders, returned to France and spoke to reporters after a crisis meeting at the Interior Ministry.  French police block access to TrÃƒÂ¨bes as they respond to the hostage situation Friday.  The French leader hailed law enforcement's response.  ""The forces of order intervened with remarkable speed, both to contain the individual who hid away with his hostages, to help one of the victims who was still alive who he had left in the surrounding area,"" Macron said.  He singled out the officer who volunteered to be traded for a hostage and saluted his bravery.  ""He has saved lives, and done his role and his country proud. He is currently fighting for his life, and all our thoughts are with him and his family,"" Macron said.  Macron said the investigation should answer several questions -- when and how the gunman was radicalized and where he got a weapon.  He said French soldiers overseas risk their lives ""to reduce this threat.""  CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the interior minister's name.",en,terrorattack,,

The blast occurred near the Tolip Hotel on Saturday afternoon in Rushdi, a neighbourhood in Egypt's second city, close to the motorcade of Major General Mostafa al-Nemr, the head of security in Alexandria, an Egyptian security source told Al Jazeera.  The suspected car bomb, which also wounded at least four people, targeted the motorcade, the source said.  State news agency MENA quoted al-Nemr as saying that two people, a policeman and a driver, were killed in the blast.  The Egyptian ministry of interior said that the attack was an assassination attempt against al-Nemr.  Former deputy interior minister Rafiq Habib told Al Jazeera he suspects the perpetrators belong to an ""extremist group"", although nothing has been yet confirmed.  ""The timing of this explosion, which comes just ahead of the presidential elections, is telling of its objective to sow fear among voters,"" Habib said.

""We will come here soon to celebrate the victory over the Kharijites ['secessionists' from Islam] of this era,"" he said, referring to armed groups in the area.  A major operation was launched on February 18 with Egyptian ground, air and naval forces, along with border guards and police.  The army ordered hospitals to be placed on high alert, preparing extra beds and personnel, to deal with emergencies and medical evacuations.  Security operations against rebel groups in Sinai have been ongoing since 2000, but the uprising picked up the moment after the military coup in 2013.  In late 2014, Egypt declared a state of emergency in the region, while Sinai's most active armed group pledged its allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).",en,terrorattack,313,"['Egypt', 'Egypt', 'Alexandria', 'Alexandria']"

INSURGENCY  Islamic State attempted to assassinate EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defence and interior ministers in December during a trip the pair made to the Sinai Peninsula, where the hardline militant group has been waging an insurgency for almost five years.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Friday that Islamic State militants would soon be defeated in the Sinai as he visited troops battling the jihadists there.  Polls will open on Monday when voters choose between Sisi and one little-known candidate who supports the former field marshal. All credible opponents dropped out in January, citing intimidation by the authorities after the main challenger was jailed.  SisiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s critics say he has cracked down harshly on dissent and that tough economic reforms have eroded his popularity. Supporters say such measures are needed to stabilise Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.  As military commander, Sisi led the ousting of EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only competitively-elected leader, President Mohamed Mursi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was toppled amid demonstrations against his rule in 2013, a year after taking power. Sisi took office with a landslide election victory a year later.  State news agency MENA blamed the Brotherhood, which is now banned in Egypt and designated a terrorist group, for SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bombing.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This attempt comes in the context of terrorist Muslim Brotherhood elements trying to disrupt the electoral process and influence citizens into not going to the polls and participating in the presidential election,Ã¢â‚¬Â the agency said.  Islamic State and other militant groups have successfully assassinated officials in recent years. Islamic State bombed a hotel in Sinai in 2015 during a parliamentary election, killing seven people including two judges overseeing the vote.

The bomb, which exploded in a car near a convoy transporting the security chief through a residential area of the Mediterranean city, also wounded 4 others, the government press office said.  General Mostafa el-Nemr, Alexandria's security chief, was not among the casualties of the ""terrorist bombing that targeted the convoy,"" his office said, quoted by state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram.  Health ministry spokesman Khaled Megahed said the casualties were taken to a military hospital.  Photographs posted online showed black smoke rising above the site of the attack on Al-Moaskar Al-Romani street, near a police station.  An Agence France-Presse correspondent at the scene said security and military units had cordoned off the area of the attack, which left several burnt-out cars.  The bombing, for which there was no immediate claim of responsibility, came ahead of Monday's start of Egypt's presidential election in which the incumbent, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is expected to sweep to a second term in office.  Sisi stormed to victory in the 2014 presidential election, having led the military a year before in ousting Egypt's first freely elected leader, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi.  Since the ouster of Morsi and a crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood, security forces have sought to quell attacks by jihadists who have declared allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group.  The jihadists of Ansar Beit al-Maddis have killed hundreds of soldiers, policemen and civilians, mainly in its North Sinai stronghold but also elsewhere in Egypt.  IS claimed the 2015 bombing of a Russian airliner carrying tourists from the South Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, which killed all 224 people on board.  It has also killed scores of members of Egypt's minority Coptic Christian community in church bombings and shootings.  Last April 9, during Palm Sunday celebrations, suicide bombers killed 45 worshippers in attacks on churches in Alexandria and Tanta, also north of Cairo, since when Egypt has been under a state of emergency.  Sisi gave the armed forces and police a three-month deadline in November to wipe out the jihadists.  The president's ultimatum came after suspected IS gunmen massacred more than 300 worshippers in a Sinai mosque associated with Sufi Muslims, who are seen by IS as heretics.  The deadline has since been extended and the armed forces have launched their most comprehensive campaign yet to end the 5-year-old jihadist insurgency.  The military gives regular updates on the operation, saying it has killed more than 100 jihadists so far while losing at least 20 troops. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,,

Eastern Ghouta was the opposition's final stronghold on the edge of Damascus, but beleaguered rebels are now left with less than 10 per cent of their one-time bastion.  Since Feb 18, a Russian-backed air and ground assault by Syrian troops has brought most of the area under government control, and Damascus is using evacuation deals to clear the last three pockets.  Talks are still ongoing for the final area around Ghouta's largest town of Douma, but negotiated withdrawals have already been reached to clear two other zones.  Fighters from the Islamist Faylaq al-Rahman faction were the latest readying to leave Eastern Ghouta, following another hardline group that quit the town of Harasta in the past few days for rebel-held Idlib province.  After several hours of delay, fighters and civilians boarded buses in the rebel-held town of Arbin and drove to a checkpoint dividing opposition-held territory from regime forces.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""Several buses carrying 500 fighters and their families have reached the Arbin crossing, in preparation for their departure from Ghouta,"" state news agency SANA reported, adding evacuations would continue Sunday.  RELATIVES BURIED UNDER RUBBLE  The evacuations from the towns of Arbin, Zamalka, and Ain Tarma had been scheduled to begin Saturday morning, but a military source said they were delayed due to ""logistical issues,"" including unblocking and demining the route they would take.  Buses entered around 4pm local time (1400 GMT), and fighters, their families, and other civilians began boarding them in Arbin as night fell.  Mohammad, 20, was among them and said his departure was bittersweet.  He and his two brothers survived bombardment on their hometown, but their father did not. They were unable to extract his body from the rubble for a funeral.  ""What kills us is that we couldn't bury our relatives. They stayed under the rubble,"" Mohammad told AFP as he limped onto a bus with his siblings.  The government has implemented a ""leave or die"" strategy to retake Ghouta, reducing swathes of it to rubble with air strikes and artillery fire but keeping open the offer of evacuation.  The onslaught has killed more than 1,600 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  State media said on Saturday that more than 105,000 civilians had fled Ghouta in recent weeks. The army has opened three ""corridors"" for people to flee from newly-recaptured territory into government zones.  Once the government had whittled down rebel territory to three isolated pockets, it pursued separate negotiations with the factions in each zone.  The first deal brokered by Russia was reached with the hardline Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham for the town of Harasta.  More than 4,500 people, including over 1,400 fighters, left Harasta for Idlib over two days.  'LOSING MY NERVES'  The second agreement was reached with Faylaq al-Rahman on Friday and provides for the transfer of around 7,000 people, medical treatment for wounded civilians and fighters, and the release of detainees held by the rebel group.  Syrian state TV on Saturday interviewed eight men who said they had been detained by Faylaq for over a year and were released under the settlement.  Waiting at the edge of Ghouta, Sabah al-Salloum desperately hoped her son Munzer - kidnapped four years ago by Ghouta rebels - would be among them.  ""I heard from the news the kidnapped would be released, and I'm losing my nerves waiting. I couldn't sleep,"" Salloum told AFP.  Those being bussed out of Ghouta on Saturday include civilians, rebels, and some allied militants from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate.  Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said the buses would go first to Idlib, then may head to Afrin - a flashpoint town recently captured by Turkey and its rebel proxies from Kurdish forces.  There was no immediate confirmation from Faylaq al-Rahman on whether their fighters were going to Afrin, but the faction is known to be backed by Ankara.  Syria's conflict erupted in March 2011 with anti-government protests but has since drawn in world powers, including Turkey and Russia.  Moscow played a key role in the two agreements already reached and is mediating talks for the last pocket, held by Jaish al-Islam.  With the conflict grinding on into its eighth year, Syria's government is more determined than ever to clear opposition holdouts around the capital to halt rebel rocket fire onto Damascus.  Student Layal al-Jumaa lives in a neighbourhood that overlooks Harasta, and woke up Saturday after a full night's sleep uninterrupted by bombardment.

With the latest detentions, the number of students being held by the police rose to seven, he added.  Erdogan on Saturday had slammed anti-war students at Bogazici University as ""terrorists"" as tensions rose on the campus over divided views of Turkey's cross-border military campaign in Syria.

In a show of protest, another group of students unfurled anti-war banners.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Aksu told AFP the detentions began on Thursday, based on the video recordings.  ""An (anti-war) expression could disturb certain quarters but it cannot be considered a crime under the Turkish penal code,"" he said.

In Turkey, police have detained over 500 people for social media posts and protests speaking out against the military offensive in Syria.

A busload of Syrian rebels evacuated from Eastern Ghouta arrives in government-held territory on March 25, 2018  One hundred buses carrying 6,749 people -- around a quarter of them fighters -- left a part of the enclave controlled by the Faylaq al-Rahman rebel faction, the SANA state news agency said.  The departure was part of a deal reached last week between the Islamist group and Russia, which is helping its Syrian ally negotiate such deals to clear the last rebels out of Ghouta.  Russian-backed Syrian troops and allied militia have waged a brutal offensive since February 18 in which they have recaptured more than 90 percent of Ghouta, a onetime rebel bastion on the edge of Damascus.  Moscow has negotiated two evacuation deals so far for Ghouta.  One, implemented last week, saw hardline Islamist rebels from Ahrar al-Sham leave the battered town of Harasta in the west of the enclave.  The agreement with Faylaq al-Rahman was announced on Friday and its implementation started the following morning.  Nearly 1,000 people -- including rebels, their relatives and other civilians -- were evacuated on Saturday, followed by 5,435 people on Sunday.  (Video YouTube/TRT World)  President Bashar al-Assad has used such agreements to recover swathes of territory since the uprising against him began seven years ago this month.  They have usually begun with the military encirclement of an area, followed by bombardment and a ground operation before a deal is reached.  Eastern Ghouta lies within mortar range of Damascus, and rebels had used it repeatedly as a launchpad for rocket attacks on the capital.  The regime responded with a crippling half-decade siege of the enclave's 400,000 residents, sealing off access to food, medicines and other goods.  On February 18, the regime, its ally Russia and loyalist militia launched an all-out air and ground assault that killed more than 1,600 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  The Britain-based monitor said it had also documented the detention of more than 40 men and boys by Syrian troops in recaptured areas.  Devastating air strikes and artillery fire have reduced large parts of Ghouta to ruins, forcing their residents to abandon them.  Some 110,000 people have fled into government-held territory, most of them on foot or motorbike, through corridors opened up by the army and its Russian allies, according to state media.  The United Nations says around 55,000 of them are housed in very basic conditions in regime-run temporary shelters on the edge of Ghouta.  - Rebel prisoners released -  Moscow has brokered talks with the rebel groups that control the three remaining pockets of the enclave.  The first agreement, with hardline Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham, saw more than 4,500 people, including rebel fighters, leave the town of Harasta last week.  Under the second deal, rebels from Faylaq al-Rahman are being given safe passage to the northwest, along with thousands of civilians, in exchange for releasing prisoners they were holding.  Eight were freed on Sunday and another 26 the following day, SANA said.  A third set of talks is underway over the final pocket -- controlled by Jaish al-Islam and including the enclave's largest town Douma.  Some 200,000 people are estimated to remain in Douma, including many who fled other parts of Ghouta as regime forces advanced.  Jaish al-Islam spokesman Hamza Bayraqdar has said the negotiations are focused on the rebels staying, not evacuating.  Jaish al-Islam would lay down its heavy weapons in exchange for government-provided water and electricity returning to the town.  Russian military police, but not Syria's army, would deploy there.  Syria's pro-government Al-Watan daily said the parties had three days to study the proposal.  But divisions within opposition ranks were holding up the talks with some hardliners seeking to sabotage the proposed deal, Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.",en,terrorattack,,

FILE PHOTO: Rebel fighters gesture as they stand next to a bus before their evacuation, at Harasta highway outside Jobar, in Damascus, Syria March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki/File Photo  Russia and the rebel faction controlling Douma, the last Ghouta town still in insurgent hands, said they were still negotiating over the fate of the town. Moscow said it saw a chance of the remaining insurgents quitting Douma.  Thousands of fighters have accepted Russian-brokered deals to leave other parts of the enclave in the past week with their families on government-supplied buses, giving them safe passage to other insurgent-held areas. Tens of thousands of other civilians have stayed behind to accept state rule, and tens of thousands more have fled across the frontline.  The collapse of rebel control in eastern Ghouta, after one of the fiercest campaigns of the seven year war, has delivered the insurgents their worst defeat since they were driven out of Aleppo in 2016.  At a weekly briefing, RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the Ã¢â‚¬Å“counter-terrorist operationÃ¢â‚¬Â in eastern Ghouta had nearly finished, according to RIA state news agency.  Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said there could be progress in talks with fighters from the Jaish al-Islam group, which holds Douma, RIA said.  Eastern Ghouta, an early centre of the 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, was until last month the biggest and most populous remaining rebel stronghold near the capital.  Its capture will cap a string of battlefield victories for the government of President Bashar al-Assad since Russia sent its air force to join his war effort against the rebellion in September 2015, making his position unassailable.

REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh/File Photo  A commander in the alliance supporting Assad, which besides Russia includes Iran and ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite militias from Lebanon and Iraq, said on Wednesday negotiations with Jaish al-Islam had stopped.  However, Jaish al-Islam official Mohammad Alloush, based outside Syria, told Reuters by text message on Thursday that talks were continuing, Ã¢â‚¬Å“despite reports of threats and provocations in order to put pressure on civiliansÃ¢â‚¬Â.  SHELTERS  Despite some artillery fire on Douma on Wednesday, there has been no renewal of the armyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s withering bombardment and assault that stormed most of the rebel enclave in just a few weeks.  It split eastern Ghouta into three parts, and the factions in two of the zones agreed surrender terms a week ago, including the choice of accepting AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule or leaving with light weapons for opposition territory in northwestern Syria.  FILE PHOTO: A girl looks out of a bus carrying rebels and their families as they wait to be evacuated, at Harasta highway outside Jobar, in Damascus, Syria March 25, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki/File Photo  Daily convoys of buses have since made the 320km (200 miles) journey to Idlib carrying about 7,500 fighters and their families, 30,000 people in all, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.  About 134,000 other people fled across front lines from rebel territory in eastern Ghouta into areas held by the government, the Observatory said. Some 40,000 people remained in the towns it has recaptured so far.  On Thursday, the United Nations resident and humanitarian coordinatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office in Syria said in an emailed update that 75,000 civilians had been received in shelters and 47,000 civilians remained in them. It described conditions in the shelters - mostly unfinished buildings, hangars or schools - as Ã¢â‚¬Å“direÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told the U.N. Syria envoy that displaced people could begin returning to eastern Ghouta in a few days, RIA said.  Assad and his allies say their offensive was needed to end the rule of Islamist militants over civilians and to stop rebel mortar fire on Damascus, which state television says has killed dozens in recent weeks. The Observatory says the government assault has killed more than 1,600 people.  Western countries and rights groups have accused the Syrian military of targeting civilian infrastructure and repeatedly using indiscriminate weapons including helicopter-dropped barrel bombs, chlorine gas and fire-setting incendiary munitions.  The Syrian and Russian governments deny all that and have accused the rebel groups of fabricating evidence of such attacks and of killing people who tried to flee their territory, which the insurgents deny.

The former rebel bastion on the outskirts of Damascus has been drained by a nearly six-week Syrian government assault and two evacuation deals brokered by regime ally Moscow.  Under such agreements, rebels agree to hand over territory in exchange for safe passage for them and civilians to opposition-held northwest Syria.  More than 36,000 people have already been bussed out of the enclave, and fresh evacuations were under way on Friday.  Some 4,800 people, including fighters, were boarding buses in a pocket of Ghouta held by the Faylaq al-Rahman rebel faction, Syrian state media reported.  The agreement for that withdrawal, reached last week, left the overpopulated, devastated town of Douma as the final rebel holdout in the region.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Russia's defence ministry on Friday said it had brokered a deal that would see rebels abandon Douma ""shortly"", but the fighters there quickly denied it.  ""We categorically refuse leaving or being displaced,"" said Jaish al-Islam's spokesman Hamza Bayraqdar.  ""That's an essential demand of the negotiations. We have not reached an agreement yet,"" he told AFP, adding that talks were ongoing.  CIVILIANS HANG IN BALANCE  Civilians in Douma have become anxious over their uncertain fate.  ""Jaish al-Islam is here and has to resolve the issue of civilians. We hope we can be done with this whole thing,"" said 39-year-old resident Mohammad al-Hussein.  ""If they made me choose between leaving or staying, I'll stay. I didn't stay here for seven years just to leave in the end,"" he added.  Eastern Ghouta was the armed opposition's last stronghold around Damascus, which groups regularly targeted with rockets and mortar rounds.  To secure Damascus, President Bashar al-Assad launched a ferocious air and ground assault on Feb 18 to oust rebels from Ghouta.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor says more than 1,600 civilians have been killed in the onslaught, which has overrun more than 90 percent of Ghouta.  Troops pursued a divide-and-conquer strategy, seizing most of the enclave then breaking up what was left of it into three isolated pockets.  Civilians walk along a destroyed street in the former rebel-held town of Harasta in Eastern Ghouta on Mar 30, 2018, a week after regime forces recaptured the town. (Photo: AFP/Stringer)  Moscow stepped in and swiftly announced two withdrawal agreements with rebels, the first of which saw more than 4,500 fighters and civilians bussed out of the town of Harasta.  The second deal, reached with Faylaq al-Rahman one week ago, has seen over 31,000 people quit the towns of Arbin and Zamalka and the Jobar district.  In the first two deals, rebels caved in to Russia's ""leave or die"" approach but negotiations for the Douma pocket, held by Jaish al-Islam, look more arduous.  Douma's population has swelled to an estimated 200,000 with people displaced from other bombed-out districts.  Jaish al-Islam had been in talks with Russia to reach a settlement whereby they could stay, instead of being bused out like other rebels.  But negotiations faltered over the group's demands of a general amnesty and unrestricted movement for Douma residents across the country, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP.  Moscow threatened Jaish al-Islam with a renewed blitz on the town if they did not agree to withdraw, and Syrian troops have amassed around the holdout.  'ABOVE GROUND'  On Thursday, Russia's foreign minister said rebel groups had ""nearly been wiped out"" by the government's offensive.  Syria's state news agency SANA said around 29,000 civilians had fled Douma in recent days, using a ""corridor"" opened up by advancing Syrian troops.  SANA said a total of 143,000 people in total had streamed out of Ghouta along such corridors and as part of the evacuation deals.  The state outlet did not confirm the agreement with Jaish al-Islam, but its correspondent said ""preliminary information"" indicated a deal was close.  Meanwhile, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said Friday it was bringing humanitarian assistance to devastated Ghouta districts already recaptured by the regime.  Red Crescent workers distributed bread, water, and other aid to the towns of Kafr Batna, Saqba, and Ain Terma.  The rebels and civilians evacuated so far have been taken northwest to Idlib, where they could finally afford basic necessities after years under siege.  ""The war we had was something unlike anything else in the world,"" said Abu Laameh, a 65-year-old evacuee who could finally afford a pack of cigarettes.  ""It feels like we were at the bottom of a well, and someone pulled us out above ground.""  But a departure to Idlib would be too ""tricky"" for Jaish al-Islam, said Thomas Pierret, an analyst at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris.  ""The problem with Jaish al-Islam is that it's quite big, very cohesive, very organised, but it doesn't go well with anyone else,"" Pierret told AFP.",en,terrorattack,,

One of the dead was aged 16 and most of the casualties were struck by gunfire, according to Palestinian medics, who estimated the number wounded at around 500 by mid-afternoon yesterday.  The Israeli military said that its troops had used ""riot dispersal means and firing towards main instigators"", and that some of the demonstrators were ""rolling burning tyres and hurling stones"" at the border fence and at soldiers.  Palestinian health officials said that Israeli forces used mostly gunfire against the protesters, in addition to tear gas and rubber bullets. Witnesses said the military had used a drone in at least one location to drop tear gas.  The Palestinian protest marked Land Day, an annual commemoration of the deaths of six Arab citizens of Israel killed by Israeli security forces during demonstrations over government land confiscations in northern Israel in 1976.  The demonstrators demanded that Palestinian refugees be allowed the right of return to towns and villages from which their families had fled, or were driven out of, when the state of Israel was created in 1948.  Tensions ran high at the start of the long-planned tent protest that began on Good Friday and the start of the Jewish Passover and is scheduled to last for six weeks. Israeli security forces are customarily on high alert during holidays, with tighter restrictions on the movement of Palestinians.  Palestinian health officials said that Israeli forces used mostly gunfire against the protesters, in addition to tear gas and rubber bullets. Witnesses said the military had used a drone in at least one location to drop tear gas.  There were also small protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. But the main focus was Gaza, from which Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005 after 38 years. The Gaza Strip is now ruled by the Islamist Hamas group and blockaded by Israel.  Gaza officials said tens of thousands of protesters gathered at five locations along the 65km, largely desert frontier with Israel. The Israeli military's estimate was 17,000.  Families took their children to camps just a few hundred metres from the border fence, with football fields marked out in the sand, and scout bands playing.  But hundreds of Palestinian youth ignored calls from the organisers and from the Israeli military to keep away, increasing the risk of confrontation with Israeli troops who had taken up positions on the other side of the fence.  In a statement, the Israeli military accused Hamas of ""cynically exploiting women and children, sending them to the security fence and endangering their lives"".  The military said that more than 100 army sharpshooters had been deployed in the area and earth-moving vehicles piled up dirt mounds to stop any attempt to breach the barrier.  Major-General Eyal Zamir, head of Israel's Southern Command, said his forces had identified ""attempts to carry out terror attacks under the camouflage of riots"".  Hamas, which seeks Israel's destruction, had earlier urged protesters to adhere to the ""peaceful nature"" of the protest.  In Gaza, an impoverished, densely populated enclave, the protest was dubbed ""The March of Return"" and some of the tents bore names of the refugees' original villages in what is now Israel, written in Arabic and Hebrew alike.  Eighty-year-old Mansi Nassar walked towards the sensitive frontier with the aid of his cane, disregarding entreaties to remain 700m from the barrier.  ""I was born in Beit Darras inside Palestine and I will accept no less than returning to it,"" he said, referring to his former home village just south of the modern Israeli city of Ashdod. The village no longer exists.  Israel has long ruled out any right of return, fearing an influx of Arabs that would wipe out its Jewish majority.  REUTERS",en,terrorattack,,

Syrian civilians and fighters arrive in Qalaat al-Madiq, some 45 kilometres northwest of the central city of Hama, on April 2, 2018 after being evacuated from the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma  A Russian-brokered deal had been reported on Sunday for fighters with Jaish al-Islam, the largest rebel group still in Ghouta, to leave the enclave's main town of Douma.  But the rebels have not yet confirmed the agreement, amid reports of divisions in the group as hardline fighters refuse to abandon their posts.  The retaking of Eastern Ghouta would mark a major milestone in President Bashar al-Assad's efforts to regain control of territory seized by rebel factions during Syria's seven-year civil war.  Assad's forces have retaken 95 percent of Eastern Ghouta since launching a blistering air and ground assault on the besieged enclave on February 18, killing 1,600 civilians and displacing tens of thousands more.  State media on Monday said Jaish al-Islam fighters and their families had started leaving Douma, in preparation for them heading to a rebel-held town in northern Syria.  ""A group of buses carrying a number of Jaish al-Islam terrorists and their families leave Douma in preparation of them being transported to Jarabulus,"" state news agency SANA said, using the government's term for all rebel fighters.  State television said six buses had left Douma, the only opposition holdout six weeks after the start of the offensive.  The rebels have been negotiating with Russia, a key ally of Assad, for days on an agreement to evacuate Douma.  Late on Sunday, Russian news agency Interfax quoted General Yuri Yevtushenko saying a ""preliminary deal"" had been reached to evacuate Jaish al-Islam fighters from Eastern Ghouta.  Jaish al-Islam has previously said it would not leave Douma and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported divisions within its ranks.  ""There are attempts to convince the hardline wing of Jaish al-Islam not to obstruct the agreement with the Russians,"" the head of the Britain-based monitor, Rami Abdel Rahman, said on Monday.  - 'We will stay' -  In video footage published by Jaish al-Islam online on Sunday, the group's leader told a group of men in a mosque he would stay.  ""We will stay in this town and will not leave. Those who want to leave should leave,"" Essam al-Buidani says.  It was not immediately possible to verify when the video was filmed.  Backed by Russia, Assad's forces have scored a series of victories over rebel forces in recent years, often through campaigns of siege, aerial bombardment and ground offensives that have drawn widespread international condemnation.  Before February 18, some 400,000 people in Eastern Ghouta had lived under regime siege for five years, facing severe food and medicine shortages.  After pounding it with air strikes, regime forces have taken back most of the enclave through a combination of ground assaults and Russia-brokered evacuation deals.  In the past few weeks, these deals have seen more than 46,000 people -- fighters and civilians -- board buses with scant belongings to be driven to the northwestern province of Idlib, which is largely outside government control.  These include more than 1,000 people -- fighters from another faction, Faylaq al-Rahman, and family members -- who left Douma late Sunday, according to state media.  On Monday before dawn, an AFP correspondent saw men, women and children step off buses in the area of Qalaat al-Madiq in central Hama province, a common way station on the road to Idlib.  An old woman dressed head-to-toe in black stood by a pile of suitcases and a blanket, a child wearing a winter coat and colourful backpack by her side.  A man slung a gun on his shoulder as he picked up a travel bag, while a young boy, who appeared weak and unable to move his limbs, was carried into an ambulance.  A man in a long white robe walked on crutches, his weight on one leg only and a light weapon visible under his khaki jacket.

Brief, given the amount of time she would have otherwise liked to spend in Pakistan with friends from her early teens, whom she saw again after a shocking and long separation.  One can easily imagine her longing to share with them stories of people she has met, things she has done, the world she has travelled and the international distinction she enjoys.  Revealing, because, as a Dawn newspaper editorial on Friday underscored, Malala's story continues to illustrate ""much of what bedevils this country, and the conflicted narrative that feeds its sense of perpetual victimhood"".  It was Malala's first homecoming since 9 October 2012 when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head.  Since then she has been living in the UK. After recovering from her near-fatal injuries, Malala and her family relocated to Birmingham and she is now studying at Oxford.  Her global fight to improve girls' literacy saw her become the youngest person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize.  Image copyright University Hospitals Birmingham Image caption Malala was transferred to the UK for recovery after the attack  The trip back to Pakistan came out of the blue. During an address at the Prime Minister House shortly after her arrival on Thursday, she said it was a ""dream come true"".  But the secrecy that shrouded her movements, and a tight security cordon that controlled people's access to her - and possibly her access to people - couldn't have been a part of that dream.  She expressed this sentiment to a neighbour in Mingora, the main town in Swat valley, where she used to live.  ""Uncle, I will come again next year, and will come without the security,"" she was quoted as telling Faridul Haq Haqqani, who spoke to BBC Urdu's Riffatullah Orakzai.  An emotional homecoming  Mr Haqqani was able to meet Malala because he lives in the house in Mingora where Malala's family lived until she was shot.  The family - Malala, her father Ziauddin Yousafzai, her mother and two brothers - flew in a military helicopter to Mingora on Saturday. They were accompanied by federal minister Maryam Aurangzeb.  The visit was just as unexpected as her arrival in Islamabad two days earlier. They spent just about two hours in the area, and visited only two places.  Their first stop - their erstwhile home - was understandably their prime destination, and the visit turned into a deeply emotional event.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Faridul Haq Haqqani now lives in Malala's old house  ""As soon as they stepped into the house, they broke into tears,"" Mr Haqqani said.  ""Ziauddin prostrated himself on the lawn of the house; he kissed the ground, then picked up the soil and rubbed it on his eyes [a thanks-giving gesture]. There was silence in the house that lasted several minutes.""  He said Malala and her mother, Topakai Yousafzai, repeatedly inquired about the neighbours and asked questions about how everyone was keeping and what they were doing.  Malala then asked to meet her friends in the neighbourhood, whom officials brought over amid tight security.  Mr Haqqani said he had a long chat with Malala as she went with him from room to room, recalling how they had used each room when they lived there.  ""I could see that her thoughts had matured. She felt restrained by the presence of security, and promised she will come without security the next time.""  The only other place she visited in Mingora was a military-run cadet college where she met students and staff and wrote in the visitors' book. Some of her friends were also invited.  Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Malala went to the all-boys Swat Cadet College Guli Bagh during her visit  This disappointed some social and political activists who had been looking forward to meeting her. Also disappointed were students of a women's college she helped build in her native district of Shangla, neighbouring Swat.  But everyone quoted in the media said they understood her constraints, and that she continued to be a target of the Taliban.

While many, including Malala herself, described her homecoming as a sign of better security in Pakistan, the limits placed on her movement and a tight lid kept on her itinerary show dangers remain.

This was evident in a fierce social media campaign mounted by her opponents during her visit, repeatedly accusing her of being a decoy and an agent of the enemy powers, promoted to humiliate Pakistan.

They pointed out that while authorities discreetly alerted some groups of Malala's visit weeks in advance, some of her father's friends from his days of political activism and known for their anti-military views were kept in the dark.  Some circles have pointed out that the military is keen to project a soft image of Pakistan as part of its efforts to reduce tensions with the US, which recently blocked military aid to Pakistan.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks in a desert in Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan March 19, 2014. REUTERS/Ahmad Masood/File photo  The office of the governor of the northern province said MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack by the government air force on a Taliban meeting had inflicted an unknown number of civilian casualties.  But villagers and the Taliban disputed the nature of the gathering, saying the air force had bombed a religious ceremony.  The casualties underlined the risk of greater use of air power under a new U.S. strategy announced last year to try to force the militant group to the negotiating table.  Sayed Jaan, a resident of the district of Dasht-i Archi, said he attended two mass funerals of almost 40 people, adding that other burials had taken place.  He said the helicopter attack happened during a religious ceremony, called Dastaar Bandi, to mark young men completing the memorization of the Koran, the Muslim holy book.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There were two mass graves to bury the victims of the bombing and I took part in both burials. In one grave, 16, and in another, 21. Many were young children,Ã¢â‚¬Â Sayed Jaan said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There were other burials and people were digging graves.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a tweet its investigators were in the area looking into Ã¢â‚¬Å“disturbing reports of serious harmÃ¢â‚¬Â to civilians.  A senior Afghan defence ministry official said the air attack happened during a meeting of militants, and killed at least 35 Taliban and wounded many more. He denied reports that civilians were harmed and said two senior Taliban commanders were among those killed.  But provincial government leaders including the governor and police had determined that the strike was against a Taliban meeting but it had also inflicted an undetermined number of civilian casualties, the governorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office said.  The Taliban briefly seized Kunduz city in 2015 and they overran it for a second time the following year. U.S. air strikes destroyed a Kunduz hospital in 2015 killing 42 people, most of them patients and medical staff.  The city has been considered relatively secure over the past year or two but the Taliban control much of the surrounding area.  A video posted online by the Taliban showed at least four bodies of children, wrapped in white shrouds. Other images circulated of children and adults being treated in hospital for injuries, but they could not be verified.  Building up the fledgling government air force has been a major priority for the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission.  On Monday, the Taliban said the strike killed 150 religious scholars and civilians and denied that any of their forces had been there.  Last year, more than 10,000 civilians died or were wounded in the war between AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Western-backed government and the militants, down 9 percent from the previous year, UNAMA said in a report in February.

The Milli Muslim League is controlled by Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed, who has a US$10 million U.S. bounty on his head. The group shot to prominence after fielding a candidate in a September 2017 by-election to fill a seat vacated by deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif.  Saeed is the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or Army of the Pure, which is also on the U.S. terrorist list and blamed by the United States and India for a four-day militant attack on the Indian city of Mumbai in 2008 in which 166 people were killed.  Saeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the attack.  The U.S. State Department said the Milli Muslim League alias had been added to the LeT's designations as a terrorist group.  ""These designations seek to deny LeT the resources it needs to plan and carry out further terrorist attacks,"" the State Department said in a statement.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""Make no mistake: whatever LeT chooses to call itself, it remains a violent terrorist group. The United States supports all efforts to ensure that LeT does not have a political voice until it gives up violence as a tool of influence,"" it added.  Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Saeed was placed under house arrest in January 2017 after years of living freely in Pakistan but a court ordered his release in November 2017.  He was not available for comment on Tuesday.  India welcomed the U.S. decision saying Pakistan has failed to crack down on militants.  ""Terrorist individuals and entities are allowed to change names and continue to operate freely from territory under Pakistan's control,"" an Indian foreign office spokesman said in New Delhi.  ""The designation ... highlights Pakistan's failure to fulfil its international obligation to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries, and disrupt terror financing,"" he added.  Pakistan has previously denied any state involvement in the Mumbai attack or links with LeT and other militant groups. It placed the LeT on a list of banned organizations in 2002.  In October 2017, Pakistan's electoral commission barred the Milli Muslim League from contesting elections, saying it had links to militant groups and could not be registered.  In March 2018 the Islamabad High Court ordered the election commission to register the party.  Under pressure from the United States, the United Nations and international institutions to crack down on terrorist financing, Pakistan drew up secret plans last December for a ""takeover"" of charities linked to Saeed.  Saeed has since taken the government decision to court.  Saeed's freedom in Pakistan, where he holds rallies, has been a thorn in Pakistan's relations with old rival India and the United States.

1448846,aljazeera,About The Author Thomas Ruttig Is A Co-director Of The Afghanistan Analysts Network Thomas Ruttig,Kunduz madrassa attack: Losing the moral high ground,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/kunduz-madrassa-attack-losing-moral-high-ground-180404095041616.html,,5/4/2018 19:43,"The attack by the Afghan government air force at the Hashemia Madrassa (religious school) in northern Kunduz province on April 2 that killed and injured scores of civilians and a number of Taliban fighters and commanders is, to paraphrase the late Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a story of deaths foretold.  Last year, after the US government announced its (not so) new Afghanistan strategy, focusing on increased military pressure on the Taliban to force them to the negotiating table, the armed group replied in kind, announcing they would not be intimidated as they had sat out an onslaught of even larger troop numbers under President Barack Obama.  To borrow a Pashto phrase, with that exchange of unpleasantries it was ""clear as the sun"" that, unfortunately, this year - since Nowruz on March 21 which is also the new Afghan year 1397 - would see another escalation of violence, pushing a breakthrough towards a negotiated end to this war further into the future. What Monday's madrassa attack showed was that there is no end in sight to this conflict and both sides are willing to write off the deaths of the people they both insist to defend as ""collateral damage"".  'Wrong examples'  Unfortunately, the Afghans' Western allies have repeatedly set wrong examples.  {articleGUID}  The most striking one was their denial, and then threadbare justification, of their bombing of a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, in the very same embattled city of Kunduz in October 2015. The bombardment, conducted by the US-led, NATO driven Resolute Support Mission, killed16 civilians and injured a further 37, among them children, patients, doctors and caretakers. The US acknowledged launching the air attack and admitted they ""may have"" hit the hospital, but tried to justify their actions by claiming that they were targeting ""individuals threatening the force"". The Taliban's declaration that they had no fighters present in the hospital, and the MSF statements that the ""hospital's coordinates were known to the US forces"" fell on deaf ears.  Following Monday's attack, the Afghan authorities followed the example their American allies set in 2015 and attempted to deny any wrongdoing. The Afghan Ministry of Defence's spokesman, for example, insisted there were no civilians present at this madrassa at all - he claimed it was a ""Taliban training centre"". It did not matter to Afghan authorities that almost at the same time the provincial governor's spokesman announced that at least 5 civilians were killed and 55 were injured as result of the air attack.  Witnesses described how helicopters first shot and then fired rockets into a crowd largely consisting of minor religious scholars, their parents and teachers. According to witness accounts, the crowd was gathered outside the school not for a high-level Taliban meeting but a turban binding ceremony and lunch. According to civilian sources on the ground there were some Taliban commanders present, but they were only there to attend the ceremony and the lunch.  An Afghan pilot should have been able to recognise such a ceremony for what it is from a presumably low-flying chopper.  Mind you, even if a high number of Taliban commanders had been present, and even if they had held a war council there, hiding among civilians - firing at such a crowd does, according to the Geneva Convention, amount to the disproportionate use of force and possibly a war crime.  Yes, the Taliban, according to the UN, still cause more civilian casualties than the Afghan forces and their international allies.  {articleGUID}  In late January, they rigged an ambulance with explosives to attack an office of the Afghan interior ministry in Kabul and - when they failed to reach their target - blew it up opposite a large hospital in the morning rush hour, killing 95 people and injuring 158 others.  And a few days after Nowruz in Lashkargah, the provincial capital of southern Helmand, someone drove a car into a crowd leaving a sports stadium, killing and injuring dozens. The Taliban did not officially claim responsibility for this atrocity. But the local chapter of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) - which is the only other usual suspect - is not known to operate in Helmand, and would have said something if they were behind it. The bombing in Lashkargah came just two days after a suicide bomber detonated near Kabul University in the Afghan capital, killing 29 people and wounding 52 others. ISIL claimed responsibility for that attack.  In contrast, forces fighting these groups under the leadership of the Resolute Support Mission and the Afghan forces that they train should hold themselves to a higher standard.  Forces representing democratic countries in Afghanistan, and their Afghan allies, should make sure to hit their targets without killing innocent civilians, or in their words, ""causing any collateral damage"". They should abide by the Geneva convention and avoid launching attacks on civilians, even when ""high value targets"" are believed to be among them.  If this does not become an unbreakable rule, Afghan government forces can not gain the moral high ground and distinguish themselves from the groups that they call ""terrorists"".

They said the demonstrators, including two teenage boys aged 16 and 17, were killed at protest sites along the frontier during a round of daily demonstrations that has been dubbed Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Great March of ReturnÃ¢â‚¬Â.  The day of violence, which saw bigger Palestinian crowds than in recent days but not as large as when the demonstration began last Friday, calmed down as night descended.  Gazans, including Palestinian refugees and their descendants seeking to regain ancestral homes in what is now Israel, have set up tent encampments a few hundred metres (yards) inside the 65-km (40-mile) fence that separates Israel from the Gaza Strip.  Large groups of youths have ventured much closer to the no-go zone along the barrier, risking live fire from Israeli troops to roll burning tyres and throw stones.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Israel took everything from us, the homeland, freedom, our future,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Samer, a 27-year-old protester who would not give his full name, fearing Israeli reprisals. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have two kids, a boy and a girl, and if I die, God will take care of them.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The number of protesters on Friday was larger than in recent days, but lower than the outset of the disturbances on March 30, when 17 Palestinians were fatally shot by Israeli forces. The Israeli military estimated FridayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turnout at around 20,000.  Refugees comprise most of the 2 million population of Israeli-blockaded Gaza, an enclave ruled by the Islamist movement Hamas which calls for IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s destruction and is designated by Western states as a terrorist organisation.  Many of those killed were militants, said Israel, which stationed sharpshooters on the frontier to stop Palestinians attempting Ã¢â‚¬Å“any breach of the security infrastructure and fence, which protects Israeli civiliansÃ¢â‚¬Â.  WAR OF WORDS  David Keyes, an Israeli government spokesman, accused Hamas of having instigated violent protests along the border.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is a travesty for the Palestinian people that the Hamas government is encouraging its people to attack Israel, it is encouraging its people to commit acts of violence,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Tear gas canisters are fired by Israeli troops during clashes with Palestinians near the Jewish settlement of Beit El, near Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman  HamasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gaza leader, Yehya Al-Sinwar, spoke at a protest encampment to praise those who turned out to confront the Ã¢â‚¬Å“enemy who besieges usÃ¢â‚¬Â. He said the demonstrations would continue, telling the crowds: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will uproot the borders, we will pluck out their hearts, and we will pray in Jerusalem.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Earlier, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem urged protesters to keep the rallies peaceful. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maintaining the peaceful nature of the protests will strike all fragile Zionist propaganda,Ã¢â‚¬Â Qassem said in a statement.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who holds little sway in Gaza, condemned what he described as IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“acts of killing and oppression conducted...against the peaceful uprising.Ã¢â‚¬Â  IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response to the protests has drawn international criticism, with human rights groups saying it involved live fire against demonstrators posing no immediate threat to life.  The demonstrators have revived a longstanding demand for the right of return of Palestinian refugees to towns and villages which their families fled from, or were driven out of, when the state of Israel was created.  The Israeli government has ruled out any right of return, fearing that the country would lose its Jewish majority.  Palestinian youths burned Israeli flags and planted Palestinian banners on dirt mounds beside tented encampments as others arrived on large trucks carrying piles of more tyres to burn. Others launched stones with slingshots.  With Israeli tear gas rising into the air, Palestinian youths used T-shirts, cheap medical masks and perfume to try and protect themselves. Israel tried to douse the burning rubber with jets of water directed over defensive dirt mounds on its side of the border.  A U.N. human rights spokeswoman urged Israel to exercise restraint against the Palestinian protesters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are saying that Israel has obligations to ensure that excessive force is not employed. And that if there is unjustified and unlawful recourse to firearms, resulting in death, that may amount to a wilful killing,Ã¢â‚¬Â Elizabeth Throssell said in Geneva.  Israel says it is doing what it must to defend its border and that its troops have been responding with riot dispersal means and fire Ã¢â‚¬Å“in accordance with the rules of engagementÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Slideshow (2 Images)  The Palestinian deaths have elicited scant concern in Israel, which has been the target of thousands of rocket strikes from Gaza over the past few years.  Palestinian militant groups have also dug tunnels under the border fence to smuggle weapons, and to launch attacks.

But the authorities appeared near-certain that there was no Islamist connection to the violence in the historic centre of Muenster.  As well as the dead, police said 20 were injured - six of them seriously - amid the broken and upturned tables and chairs seen strewn across the pavement in images of the scene.  Germany has been on especially high alert for such terrorist attacks after several claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.  The worst of those saw a Tunisian asylum seeker ram a truck into crowds at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12.  In the Saturday afternoon attack, inflicted as locals and tourists enjoyed a sunny spring day, there was ""no indication at the moment that there is any Islamist connection"", said North Rhine-Westphalia state interior minister Herbert Reul.  Psychological problems  While stressing that the investigation was still on-going, Reul said the perpetrator was believed to be a German citizen ""and not, as has been claimed everywhere, a refugee or something like that"".  Media reports said the driver, identified only as Jens R., had a history of mental health problems.  Public broadcaster ZDF said the man had recently attempted suicide while rolling news channel NTV said he had spoken of a desire to bring as much attention as possible to his death.  ZDF also reported that he had possible links with far-right movements.  News website Spiegel Online reported that Jens R. lived in Muenster and police had found an assault weapon at his flat.  Police in the university city of 300,000 did not immediately confirm the reports.  They said that ""a potentially suspicious object"" had been found in the vehicle that might possibly be an explosive, and experts had been called in to deactivate it.  ""There was a bang and then screaming. The police arrived and got everyone out of here,"" an employee of the restaurant hit by the terrace told NTV.  ""There were a lot of people screaming. I'm angry - it's cowardly to do something like this.""  Armed police cordoned off a wide area around the scene of the attack, urging residents to avoid the city centre to allow investigators to get to work amid initial fears the country had suffered another extremist assault.  'Deeply shaken'  Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""deeply shaken"" by the incident and ""everything possible will be done to determine what was behind this act and to help the victims"".  The presidents of Russia and France, Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron, each sent their condolences.  The attack is the latest in a string across Europe in which vehicles have been used to attack crowds of people in public places.  In the Berlin Christmas market attack, Tunisian asylum-seeker Anis Amri hijacked a truck and murdered its Polish driver before killing another 11 people and wounding dozens more by ploughing the heavy vehicle through the festive market in central Berlin.  He was shot dead by Italian police in Milan four days later while on the run.  In France, ISIS claimed a 2016 truck attack in Nice on its July 14 national holiday that killed 86.  And in Spain, the jihadists also claimed a rampage along Barcelona's Las Ramblas boulevard in August 2017 that killed 14 and left more than 100 injured.  Like other European nations, Germany remains a target for jihadist groups, in particular because of its involvement in the coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and its deployment in Afghanistan since 2001.  A court last month sentenced a man to life in prison for killing one and wounding six others with a knife in a Hamburg supermarket out of a ""jihadist"" motive last July.  IS also claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in 2016, including the murder of a teenager in Hamburg, a suicide bombing in the southern city of Ansbach that wounded 15, and an axe attack on a train in Bavaria that left five injured.  Germany's security services estimate there are around 10,000 Islamic radicals in Germany, some 1,600 of whom are suspected of being potentially violent.  Political opponents of Chancellor Merkel have charged that the security situation has worsened with the arrival of more than one million migrants and refugees since 2015, many from African and Middle Eastern conflict hot spots.",en,terrorattack,345,['Germany']

The US, Britain, France and six other countries requested Monday's emergency session after rescue teams and medics said a ""poisonous chlorine gas attack"" in Douma on Saturday killed dozens of people, including many children and women.  The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad and its ally Russia have called the allegations ""fabrications"".  As the fallout continued on Monday, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, told the urgent meeting that Washington was ready to ""respond"" to the attack regardless of Security Council acted or not.  ""We have reached the moment when the world must see justice done,"" Haley said, striking a sombre and threatening tone.  ""History will record this as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria,"" she added. ""Either way, the United States will respond.""  Moments earlier, Vassily Nebenzia, Haley's counterpart, had called the chemical attack allegations ""fake news"" and said Russia was ready to fly weapons' inspectors to the site to see for themselves.  Warning that any military action against Syria's government could have ""grave repercussions"", the Russian ambassador also accused US, France and Britain of ""hawkish rhetoric"" and ""boorishness against my country"", adding that their lack of a clear strategy for Syria was ""appalling"".  'Abrasive rhetoric'  Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said the he different narratives and the ""escalation in rhetoric"" laid bare the divide within the Security Council.  ""The statement from the Russian ambassador was as abrasive as has been heard within the Security Council for a long period of time,"" he said.  ""The responses from the US and its allies were equally stern and gloomy, so certainly there is a level of debate within the council that is possibly more abrasive, more confrontational and less constructive than we've heard before.""  Meanwhile, Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy to Syria, issued an urgent call for unity and action at the emergency meeting.  ""I urge the Security Council, in accordance with its own mandate, to maintain international peace and security and uphold international law to, for God's sake, ensure a mechanism is found to investigate this allegation and attribute responsibilities.""  Earlier on Monday, US President Donald Trump pledged to soon announce ""major decisions"" over the attack, while his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, warned against ""provocation"".  In a statement, the Kremlin said Putin had held a phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, during which the two ""leaders exchanged opinions on the situation in Syria, including the accusations against Damascus by a number of Western countries of using chemical weapons.  ""The Russian side stressed the unacceptability of provocation and speculation on this matter,"" the Kremlin added.  For his part, Trump condemned what he called a ""heinous attack on innocent"" Syrians in Douma, as he opened a cabinet meeting at the White House, adding that decisions would come in the ""next 24-48 hours"".  Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron have also vowed a ""strong, joint response"", while Jim Mattis, the US defence secretary, said nothing was off the table in terms of military action.  In April last year, Trump ordered air raids on Syrian government facilities in the wake of a chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun , a rebel-held town, which killed at least 80 people.  ""The question now is whether the president will have a similar reaction after seeing similar images coming out of Douma,"" Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said, adding that several emergency meetings with military and political advisers were taking place in and around the White House on the matter.  On Sunday, Trump warned Iran and Russia that there would be a ""big price to pay"" for backing the ""animal Assad"".          Meanwhile Theresa May, the British prime minister, said on Monday that the Syrian government ""and its backers, including Russia, must be held to account"" if it is found to be responsible for dropping chemical weapons on Douma residents.  But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that ""making any deductions is wrong and dangerous"", suggesting that rebels could have staged the attack themselves to pin the blame on Damascus.  Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said Russian specialists had found no trace of a chemical attack on Douma.  The heated exchange of remarks also came after missiles struck a Syrian airbase in Homs province earlier on Monday, state media reported, with Russia and Syria blaming Israel for carrying out the attack.  Two Israeli fighter jets, using Lebanese airspace, fired eight missiles at the T-4 military airbase, the Russian military said, but offered no further information.  The attack at the airbase, located 40km west of Palmyra, killed and wounded several people, Syrian state news agency SANA reported, citing an unnamed military source.  Israel has not responded to the accusations.",en,terrorattack,344,"['US', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Russia']"
1468027,bbci,None,Syria war: What we know about Douma 'chemical attack',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43697084,,10/4/2018 19:18,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Medical and rescue organisations say most of the victims were children and women  Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed on Saturday in a suspected chemical attack on Douma, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region.  They allege that bombs filled with toxic chemicals were dropped by Syrian government forces. The government says the attack was fabricated.  Why was Douma being bombed?  In February, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad launched an assault on the Eastern Ghouta that has reportedly left more than 1,600 civilians dead.  In March, troops split the region into three pockets - the largest of which was around Douma, home to between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Facing defeat, rebel groups in the other two pockets agreed to be evacuated to northern Syria.  But the group controlling Douma, Jaysh al-Islam, continued to hold out. On Friday, after negotiations with the government stalled, air strikes resumed.  What happened on Saturday?  The bombardment continued on Saturday, with dozens of people reportedly killed or injured by conventional munitions before the suspected chemical attack.  Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reported two separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force.  The first occurred at approximately 16:00 (13:00 GMT) and saw a bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Activists say Douma came under intense aerial bombardment on Saturday  It cited a rescue worker from the Syria Civil Defence as saying he smelt chlorine in the air after the strike, but that he could not determine its source.  ""We later discovered the bodies of people who had suffocated from toxic gases. They were in closed spaces, sheltering from the barrel bombs, which may have caused their quick death as no-one heard their screams,"" he added.  The VDC said the second incident took place not far to the east at approximately 19:30, when Martyrs' Square was hit.  At 19:45, more than 500 patients - most of them women and children - were brought to medical facilities with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent, according to the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a relief organisation that supports hospitals.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack  The patients showed signs of ""respiratory distress, central cyanosis (blue skin or lips), excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour"", a joint statement issued on Sunday said. One woman who died had convulsions and pinpoint pupils.  Rescue workers searching homes in the affected area also found the bodies of people with oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns, the statement added.  The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, also said it received reports of two incidents.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Patients were hosed down with water to remove any chemicals on their skin  People were treated for breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes following the first, the UOSSM said. After the second, patients were brought to hospital smelling strongly of a chlorine-like substance and presenting symptoms that included cyanosis, foaming of the mouth, and cornea irritation, it added.  A medical student working at a hospital told the BBC he had treated a man who died. ""His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow. Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well,"" he said.  Videos posted by the opposition activist group Douma Revolution showed what it said were the bodies of children, women and men found in the affected area. Some had foam coming out of their mouths and noses.  How many people died?  The VDC said 25 people died as a result of the first strike on the bakery and that another 20 died as a result of the second on Martyrs' Square.  The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said rescue workers found 42 people dead in their homes. One person was declared dead on arrival at a hospital, and another six died while receiving treatment, they added. Rescuers were prevented from searching for more bodies by strong odours that caused breathing difficulties.  The UOSSM initially reported that 70 people were confirmed dead. On Monday, it revised down the figure to at least 42, but said it was expected to rise.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on Friday and Saturday killed almost 100 people. It said they included 21 who died as a result of suffocation, but that it was unable to identify the cause.  What could they have been exposed to?  On Monday, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said a fact-finding mission was ""gathering further information from all available sources to establish whether chemical weapons were used"".  Experts say it is impossible to know whether a person has been exposed to a chemical agent from looking at a video or photo. The only way to confirm contamination is to take samples and analyse them in a laboratory. However, international humanitarian organisations have not been allowed to enter Douma since early March because of the government's siege.  The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS believe those who died suffocated as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, most likely an organophosphate - a compound grouping associated with pesticides and nerve agents.  The UOSSM also concluded that the symptoms of the casualties were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, possibly one mixed with chlorine. Dr Raphal Pitti of UOSSM France said he thought ""chlorine was used to conceal the use of [the nerve agent] Sarin"".  The United States, which supports the opposition to Mr Assad, said the victims' symptoms appeared to be ""consistent with an asphyxiation agent and of a nerve agent of some type"".  What does the Syrian government say?  The Syrian government, which has repeatedly denied ever using chemical weapons, accused rebels of ""fabricating"" the reports in a ""failed attempt"" to stop the government retaking Douma.  A foreign ministry source told the official Sana news agency: ""Every time the Syrian Arab Army advances in its fight against terrorism, claims emerge of chemical weapons use.""  Image copyright AFP Image caption Syrian government ground forces advanced towards Douma on Saturday  Russia's foreign ministry said the reports from Douma were ""bogus"".  Its permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, said on Monday that Russian military specialists had visited Douma and ""confirmed that there were no chemical substances found on the ground, no dead bodies found, no poisoned people in the hospitals"".  ""The doctors in Douma deny that there were people who came to the hospital claiming that they were under the chemical attack,"" he added.  Mr Nebenzia said OPCW experts should fly to Syria immediately and ""see for themselves what happened"", offering protection from Russian troops.  How has the international community reacted?  United Nations Secretary General AntÃƒÂ³nio Guterres said he was outraged by the reports from Douma and warned that ""any confirmed use of chemical weapons, by any party to the conflict and under any circumstances, is abhorrent and a clear violation of international law"".  US President Donald Trump declared on Monday that there had been a ""heinous attack on innocent Syrians with banned chemical weapons"".  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'We will make a major decision in next 24-48 hours'  Mr Trump said he was talking with US military leaders to decide who was responsible and would make some major decisions within 24 to 48 hours, adding that ""nothing is off the table"". A year ago, he ordered a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase after a Sarin attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun killed more than 80 people.  The UK and France said Saturday's incident bore the hallmarks of previous chemical weapons attacks blamed on the Syrian government.  When were chemical weapons used before?  In August 2013, rockets containing Sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs in the Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people. UN experts confirmed that Sarin was used in the attack, but they were not asked to ascribe any blame.  Western powers said only Syrian government forces could have carried out the attack. President Assad denied the allegation, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal.  Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission also said they were confident that government forces were behind the April 2017 Sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun, which Mr Assad dismissed as a fabrication.  The mission has also found that government forces have used chlorine as a weapon on at least three occasions during the civil war.",en,terrorattack,344,['Syria']
1468686,channelnewsasia,None,Trump vows 'forceful' response after Syria attack,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trump-vows-forceful-response-after-syria-attack-10121036,,10/4/2018 21:51,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump was poised on Tuesday (Apr 10) to decide on possible military action against the Syrian regime, after vowing to respond ""forcefully"" to the latest alleged chemical atrocity in the country's bloody civil war despite strong warnings from Damascus-ally Russia.  The United States, backed by Britain and France, has said it is ready to act with or without support from the United Nations, where the Security Council was to vote as early as Tuesday on rival US and Russian proposals to probe chemical attacks in Syria.  Trump met his cabinet and then dined with top generals Monday, telling reporters ""we have a lot of options militarily and we'll be letting you know pretty soon ... probably after the fact.""  Washington and Moscow set out starkly different positions at a stormy emergency session at the UN Security Council, where Russia's ambassador Vassily Nebenzia warned that the possibility of US military action was ""very, very dangerous.""  Nebenzia rejected a US call for the world body to set up a probe to identify the perpetrators of what rescuers called a ""poisonous chlorine gas attack"" late Saturday in the enclave of Douma, near Damascus.  But US Ambassador Nikki Haley said the ""world must see justice done.""  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""History will record this as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria,"" Haley declared.  Diplomats said the United States was pushing for a vote on Tuesday on its draft resolution setting up a Syria gas attacks inquiry, but Russia could veto the measure.  Trump slammed the ""horrible attack"" and vowed to respond ""forcefully.""  ""We're going to make a decision tonight or very shortly thereafter,"" he told reporters.  Rescuers and medics in Douma say more than 40 people died after the suspected poison gas attack in the last rebel-held pocket of the one-time opposition stronghold of Eastern Ghouta.  France warned it would retaliate against the Assad regime if evidence emerges that it was behind the attack.  ""If the red line has been crossed, there will be a response,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.  He added that intelligence shared by President Emmanuel Macron and Trump ""in theory confirms the use of chemical weapons.""  Access to the area, which has faced weeks of regime bombardment, is limited and AFP has not independently verified the accounts.  In April last year, Trump launched a cruise missile strike against a Syrian air base after a previous chemical weapons attack UN monitors later pinned on Bashar al-Assad's regime.  'VERY DANGEROUS'  The punitive raid did not draw US forces any deeper into Syria's civil war, nor did it dissuade Syria or its Russian and Iranian backers from pursuing their campaign against rebel groups.  And any new action raises the risk of open conflict with Russia which, like Iran, has deployed forces to defend Assad's regime.  Nebenzia, reflecting earlier warnings from President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, said: ""From what we hear now, I am afraid they are looking for a military option, which is very, very dangerous.""  Earlier, Trump was asked whether Putin bore some of the responsibility for the latest attack. ""Everybody is going to pay a price. He will. Everybody will,"" the American president warned.  Washington's main European allies stood by reports blaming Assad.  Trump spoke to Macron for the second time in two days over the alleged attacks, with the pair expressing a ""desire for a firm response from the international community to these new violations of the chemical weapons ban,"" according to the Elysee Palace.  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke with the acting US secretary of state and, according to London, they agreed that ""this attack bore hallmarks of previous chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime.""  As the UN debate took place, a huge blast tore through a multi-story building in the militant-held city of Idlib, in northern Syria.  The cause of the explosion was not immediately apparent, but the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 13 people had been killed and another 80 wounded.  INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED  The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said it was investigating the Douma attack allegations, but that so far only a ""preliminary analysis"" had taken place.  Syrian regime forces have carried out an offensive against Ghouta since Feb 18 that has killed more than 1,700 civilians and cornered rebels in their last holdout of Douma.  After capturing most of Ghouta, Syria and Russia secured two negotiated withdrawals last month that saw 46,000 rebels and civilians evacuate.  Following fraught negotiations and a regime bombing blitz, state media announced Sunday a deal for Jaish al-Islam to leave Douma within 48 hours and release hostages.  A group of detainees arrived in Damascus overnight Monday to Tuesday after being freed by Jaish al-Islam, state news agency SANA said.  In a parallel operation, 65 buses carrying fighters and civilians left the outskirts of Ghouta and headed to northern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.",en,terrorattack,344,['Syria']
1470918,foxnews,None,US warning at the UN: 'The world must see justice done' on Syria,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/u8LN_4S9Qjs/us-warning-at-un-world-must-see-justice-done-on-syria.html,,11/4/2018 11:32,"As President Donald Trump on Monday warned he soon would be making Ã¢â‚¬Å“major decisionsÃ¢â‚¬Â to respond Ã¢â‚¬Å“forcefullyÃ¢â‚¬Â to murderous suspected chemical attacks against civilians in the rebel-held Syrian town of Douma, the stakes for the United Nations in the made-in-Syria crisis were just as high.  Nikki Haley, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., passionately outlined the challenge for the world organization at an emergency meeting of the Security Council, called to debate what to do next about the April 7 chemical assault by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.  The attack is believed to have killed more than 40 people, including numerous women and children, and left perhaps 100 more injured.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have reached the moment when the world must see justice done,Ã¢â‚¬Â Haley warned. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There can be no more rationalizations for our failure to act.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“History will record this,Ã¢â‚¬Â she declared, Ã¢â‚¬Å“as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Either way,Ã¢â‚¬Â Haley summarized, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the U.S. will respond.Ã¢â‚¬Â  What that U.S. action will be, and when it will occur, Trump promised to reveal shortly, though Ã¢â‚¬Å“after the fact,Ã¢â‚¬Â as he told journalists.  But the U.N.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s haplessness in confronting chemical assaults and numerous other war crimes by AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces, backed by Russian warplanes and Iranian-supported militias, has reached its own high-water mark, culminating in the emergency Council session and anything that occurs after it.  As a result of that cynical war of attrition behind diplomatic cover, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the U.N. is worse than meaningless,Ã¢â‚¬Â Frederick Kagan, resident scholar and director of the Critical Threats project at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News days in advance of the latest chemical attack. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is allowing itself to be manipulated as cover for atrocities and war crimes.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Kagan called diplomats Ã¢â‚¬Å“foolishly naÃƒÂ¯veÃ¢â‚¬Â for accepting previous resolutions that endorsed a tattered ceasefire and virtually non-existent Ã¢â‚¬Å“de-escalation zonesÃ¢â‚¬Â that Assad and his backers had repeatedly violated at will.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Russians always intended to violate them,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Yesterday at the Security Council, Haley essentially agreed. Charging that the hands of PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime Ã¢â‚¬Å“were all covered in the blood of Syrian civilians,Ã¢â‚¬Â she declared. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Russia could stop this senseless slaughter if it wanted. But it stands with the Assad regime and supports [it] without any hesitation.Ã¢â‚¬Â  CLICK HERE FOR HALEYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S FULL REMARKS.  For his part, Russian Ambassador to the U.N. Vassiley Nebenzia denied outright that anything at all had happened.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our military radiological, biological chemical unit was on site of the alleged chemical accident,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told the Council. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It confirmed there was no chemical substances found Ã¢â‚¬â€ no bodies, no poisoned people in hospitals, doctors in Douma denied that anyone was coming to hospital.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Some diplomats took the statement to mean that the area already had been scrubbed of chemical residues.  The tenuous, Security Council-endorsed 30-day ceasefire that ultimately was shredded by AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s air raids and military attacks in the rebellious suburban region of eastern Ghouta, in which Douma also is located, already has known countless violations of humanitarian law.  The assaults have including numerous alleged chlorine gas attacks as well as bombing raids on civilian hospitals and other vulnerable areas, which have been a signature tactic of AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces, and those of his allies, for years. In recent weeks the pounding in eastern Ghouta left hundreds dead and unknown numbers injured.  Russia had joined in a unanimous endorsement of the ceasefire at the Security Council, but as Haley observed, immediately began violating it.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Russian officials are on the ground helping direct the regimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœstarve and surrenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ campaign,Ã¢â‚¬Â she declared, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and Iranian allied forces do much of the dirty work. When the Syrian military pummels civilians, they rely on the military hardware given by Russia.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Diplomatic obstruction by Russian president Vladimir Putin whittled the ceasefire down to meaningless five-hour pauses in the Assad attacks until population centers in East Ghouta began to surrender. Their submission was followed by mass deportations of civilian residents, reports of summary executions, and a continuation of near-starvation conditions among survivors.  Then, after a brief pause, the assault started again on Douma, culminating in the latest chemical massacre.  What Haley and the U.S. were asking the U.N. Security Council to provide today is, in part, something the U.N. already had done less than a year ago Ã¢â‚¬â€ establish a Ã¢â‚¬Å“truly professional and impartial mechanismÃ¢â‚¬Â to investigate chemical weapons attacks in Syria as well as demand Ã¢â‚¬Å“unrestricted humanitarian accessÃ¢â‚¬Â to Douma, which has been under siege by the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad since April 2013.  A U.S. draft resolution also voiced the CouncilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“outrage that individuals continue to be killed and injured by chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, and expresses its determination that those responsible must be held accountable.Ã¢â‚¬Â  For his part, RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s U.N. ambassador declared the U.S. draft contained Ã¢â‚¬Å“unacceptable elements,Ã¢â‚¬Â and eventually vetoed the proposed measure. A much weaker Russian counter-proposal, which would not provide for assigning responsibility for the attack, failed for lack of a Council majority, without a U.S. veto.  Yet another Russian and Swedish-sponsored compromise resolution also failed.  By contrast, a strong Security Council-approved impartial mechanism, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM, formally reported last June, that deadly sarin gas, a banned chemical weapon, had been used in an attack on the Syrian town of Khan Shaykhun, leaving at least 74 dead and more than 550 injured. The report made clear that the only real suspects were AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s air forces, which were backed up over Khan ShaykhunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skies by Russian warplanes.  Jointly-sponsored both by the U.N. and the OPCW, the JIM by its nature immediately put the weight of the international community behind its findings.  Two days after the chemical attack, and long before the JIM report appeared, the Trump Administration fired some 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air force base where he said the sarin attack was launched. It was, he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread of deadly chemical weapons.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The main outcome: in October, 2017, Russia vetoed a resolution that would have extended the JIMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mandate for another year. The mechanism ceased to exist in November Ã¢â‚¬â€ and in January, February and March, 2018, at least five chlorine gas attacks were reported to have taken place in or around Douma.  In fact, Haley asserted in the Security Council: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Since the Assad regime used chemical weapons at Khan Shaykhun one year ago, chemical weapons have been reportedly used dozens of times. And this Council does nothing.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Throughout the months of growing crisis over AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continued assaults, the U.N.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s pronouncements have mainly revolved around hopes for a peace process orchestrated by Russia and Iran, in tandem with Turkey, that have done little more than freeze facts on the ground between rounds of Russian-backed regime attacks. The U.N. has also made largely ineffectual appeals to get humanitarian aid to starving, rebel-held besieged areas in East Ghouta and elsewhere.  As recently as March 29, after a meeting with Russian Federation defense minister Sergey Shoigu, the U.N.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, announced that Ã¢â‚¬Å“this is the fourth time we are having a useful, and in my opinion, very constructive discussion with Minister ShoiguÃ¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€ about humanitarian access to eastern Ghouta and Douma, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“the way to ensure the protection of civilians.Ã¢â‚¬Â None of those conversations had led to much.  For his part, Secretary General Guterres has mainly issued carefully modulated statements of concern. When the April 7 chemical attack occurred, Guterres was on his way to a visit with Chinese president Xi Jinping. After he arrived in Beijing, his spokesperson issued a statement declaring the Secretary General was Ã¢â‚¬Å“deeply concerned about renewed and intensive violence in Douma, and particularly alarmed by allegations that chemical weapons have been used against civilian populations in Douma.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The spokesperson said that Guterres was Ã¢â‚¬Å“particularly alarmedÃ¢â‚¬Â by the allegations of chemical weapons use, but added carefully that Ã¢â‚¬Å“while the United Nations is not in a position to verify these reports, the Secretary-General notes that any use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, is abhorrent, and requires a thorough investigation.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Due to the Russian intransigence, however, any investigation would not be carried out by a fact-finding mechanism used in the past, but only by the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a multilateral but non-U.N. body that operates under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention Ã¢â‚¬â€ and which partnered with the U.N. in the ill-fated JIM.  GuterresÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ spokesperson emphasized that right now Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the hands of the OPCWÃ¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€ although Ã¢â‚¬Å“if the U.N. in Syria can be helpful in any way, we will do so.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The OPCWÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, has expressed his Ã¢â‚¬Å“grave concernÃ¢â‚¬Â regarding the April 7 Douma attack, and said the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fact-Finding Mission would report its findings Ã¢â‚¬â€ he did not say when Ã¢â‚¬â€ to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“states parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Critics have long argued the U.N. in Syria has been tacitly supportive of the Assad regime, by funneling much of its humanitarian aid through regime-dominated organizations and acquiescing in the removal of medical and other critical supplies from a handful of relief convoys that managed to get AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s permission to reach long-besieged areas such as eastern Ghouta.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The U.N. has failed miserably multiple times,Ã¢â‚¬Â observes Zaher Sahloul, president and co-founder of MedGlobal, a non-government organization that has trained medical personnel in Syria as well as elsewhere. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Most U.N. assistance is channeled into regime-controlled areas. The regime uses its own budget to buy weapons.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Even on symbolic levels, the sprawling and uncoordinated U.N. array of organizations has been unable to distance itself from the Syrian regime.  This week, the Geneva-based gadfly organization U.N. Watch tried to raise a fuss about the fact that SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representative is slated to take over in May the monthly rotating presidency of the Conference on Disarmament, a 65-member U.N. body that debates Ã¢â‚¬Å“practically all multilateral arms control and disarmament problems,Ã¢â‚¬Â according to its website.  The Conference boasts that it originally negotiated the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction Ã¢â‚¬â€ which is now governed by another U.N.-supported organization in which Syria is also a member.  U.N. Watch has called for the U.S., the European Union and U.N. Secretary General Guterres to protest the Syrian presidential rotation and boycott proceedings during the Syrian tenure. But stopping Syria from taking the disarmament post is pretty much impossible. The rules of the Conference on Disarmament provide that the presidency rotates on a strictly alphabetical basis among its member states, unless the selected member state chooses otherwise.  In fact, Syria held the presidency of the Conference on Disarmament once before, in 2007. As it happens, that was the year in which Israel successfully bombed a clandestine nuclear reactor Syria was building with the aid of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dangerous nuclear proliferator, North Korea.  North Korea, in turn, assumed the presidency of the Conference on Disarmament in 2011.  That artificial equal status among U.N. member states was further underlined in March by a panel of experts who monitor U.N. sanctions against North Korea.  In a lengthy report largely focused on sanctions evasion, the experts took note of the surprising behavior of the U.N.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Geneva-based World Intellectual Property Association, which had facilitated an international patent by North Korea for the industrial production of sodium cyanide Ã¢â‚¬â€ which can be used in the production of the nerve gas Tabun.  WIPO had not felt it necessary to advise the sanctions experts about the patent, even though sodium cyanide was explicitly named on U.N. sanctions lists as a banned chemical. At the time, a WIPO spokesperson told Fox News that: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We communicate with the relevant U.N. oversight committees as necessary.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The sanctions panel, however, found WIPOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s judgment to be in error. Moreover, the experts noted that when they asked WIPO to provide information on the patent inventors and their North Korean affiliations, WIPO said the information was not required in their patent application form.  The panel noted dryly that Ã¢â‚¬Å“this makes it impossible to determine whether the inventors from [North Korea] were affiliatedÃ¢â‚¬Â with any organizations or individuals on U.N. sanctions lists.  The panel of experts Ã¢â‚¬Å“recommendedÃ¢â‚¬Â that WIPO do better in the future.  In the gruesome aftermath of SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recent chemical weapons atrocities, the stakes Ã¢â‚¬â€ for the U.N. and for the world Ã¢â‚¬â€ are much, much higher.

The Para state security service described the mass escape attempt at the Santa Izabel Penitentiary Complex, near the Amazon rainforest city of Belem in Para state, as a military style battle in which both prisoners inside and associates on the outside were armed.  ""In the rescue attempt, explosives were used against one of the walls,"" the agency said in a statement.  ""The attempt was supported by an extremely heavily armed group. According to preliminary reports, the prisoners also had weapons inside the prison,"" the statement said.  Prison guards fought back in ""an intense exchange of gunfire"", it said.  The confirmed dead so far included 20 prisoners and outside attackers, and one guard. Another five guards were injured, including one seriously, the statement said.  A headcount was now underway in the prison to establish if anyone succeeding in escaping, while a police SWAT team had arrived to reinforce security.  Police had recovered two rifles and five handguns at the scene, the statement said.  Brazil is one of the world's most deadly countries, with around 60,000 homicides a year, and the prisons are notoriously overcrowded and violent.  There were 726,712 inmates as of June 2016 and capacity for only 368,000, according to the most recent official statistics.  Powerful drug gangs routinely take their turf wars from the streets of Rio de Janeiro and other big cities into penitentiary facilities. In the worst cases, security staff are reduced to bystanders as the criminal bosses run daily life.  In one of the most bloody episodes, 56 people were killed in an uprising in a prison in the city of Manaus in Brazil's Amazon in 2017.  In January, fighting between gangs at a prison in the northeastern Ceara state left 10 dead.  The bloodshed took place in the Itapaje Public Prison, about 125 kilometres from the state capital, Fortaleza.  A few days earlier, at least 14 people had been gunned down at a nightclub in Fortaleza. Local media reported that the massacre, conducted by armed men who arrived in three cars, was related to disputes between rival drug traffickers.  Adding to Brazil's security woes, the police force is regularly accused of breaking the law in carrying out extrajudicial killings, falsifying evidence and failing to investigate its own officers.  Human Rights Watch reported earlier this month that police had killed 4,224 people in 2016 - the last available figures - which was about 26 per cent more than in 2015.  The streets are also deadly for police: 437 were killed in 2016, the report said.",en,terrorattack,,

But the incident has thrust Syria's seven-year-old conflict back to the forefront of international concern.  Adding to the volatile situation, Iran, Assad's main ally along with Russia, threatened to respond to an air strike on a Syrian military base on Monday that Tehran, Damascus and Moscow have blamed on Israel.  Meanwhile on the ground, thousands of militants and their families arrived in rebel-held northwestern Syria after surrendering Douma to government forces. The evacuation deal restores Assad's control over the entire eastern Ghouta - formerly the biggest rebel bastion near Damascus.  The Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is already at work trying to establish what exactly took place in Douma.  But whether a team would try to get there was unclear. OPCW inspectors have been attacked on two previous missions to the sites of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  ""Syria is keen on cooperating with the OPCW to uncover the truth behind the allegations that some Western sides have been advertising to justify their aggressive intentions,"" state news agency SANA said, quoting an official Foreign Ministry source.  In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would submit a resolution to the UN Security Council proposing that the OPCW investigate the alleged attack.  Military Options  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said there was no threat of the situation in Syria resulting in a military clash between Russia and the United States.  TASS news agency quoted Bogdanov as saying Russia and US officials had ""working contacts"" over Syria and he believed common sense would prevail.  On Monday, Trump told a meeting of military leaders and national security advisers in Washington that he would take a decision that night or shortly after on a response, and that the United States had ""a lot of options militarily"" on Syria.  ""But we can't let atrocities like we all witnessed ... we can't let that happen in our world ... especially when we're able to because of the power of the United States, the power of our country, we're able to stop it,"" Trump said.  The United States has requested the UN Security Council vote at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Tuesday on a proposal for a new inquiry on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, diplomats said. The resolution was likely to be vetoed by Syrian ally Russia.  At a meeting on Monday, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Washington would respond to the suspected attack whether the Security Council acted or not.  ""This is basically a diplomatic set-up,"" said Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.  ""Russia will inevitably veto the US resolution criticizing Assad, and Washington will use this to justify military strikes,"" he said. ""A breakdown at the UN will also make it easier for France to justify strikes.""  France said it would respond if it was proven that Assad's forces carried out the attack. Any riposte would most likely be in coordination with the United States, government aides said.  The British government is also discussing military intervention with its allies in Syria in response to the alleged attack. Prime Minister Theresa May will talk to Trump later on Tuesday.  ""That kind of atrocity is not acceptable,"" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said. ""My prime concern is that we do not have a repeat of those appalling atrocities, and that we are doing everything we can to protect men women and children who are targeted.""  US officials told Reuters that Washington was weighing a multinational military response. Washington bombed a Syrian government air base last year over a toxic gas attack.  Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the United States, France and Britain of stoking international tensions by engaging in a ""confrontational policy against Russia and Syria"".  ""Russia is being unpardonably threatened. The tone with which this is being done has gone beyond the threshold of what is acceptable, even during the Cold War.""  More Clarity  Initial US assessments have been unable to determine conclusively what materials were used in the attack and could not say with certainty that Assad's forces were behind it.  Trump said, however, that Washington was ""getting more clarity"" on who was responsible.  A previous joint inquiry of the United Nations and the OPCW had found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an attack in April 2017, and had also several times used chlorine as a weapon. Damascus blamed Islamic State militants for mustard gas use.  The suspected chemical attack came at the end of one of the deadliest Syrian government offensives of the war, with an estimated 1,700 civilians killed in eastern Ghouta in air and artillery bombardments.  Despite the international revulsion over the chemical weapons attacks, the death toll from such incidents is in the dozens, a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians killed since an uprising against Assad's rule broke out in March 2011.  The deal over the rebel evacuation of Douma took effect on Sunday, hours after medical aid groups reported the suspected chemical attack  RIA news agency quoted Russia's Defense Ministry as saying 3,600 militants and their families had left Douma over the past 24 hours. About 40,000 militants and their families are expected to leave, the pro-government Watan newspaper said.  Sixty-seven buses carrying hundreds of fighters, along with family members and other civilians who did not wish to come back under Assad's rule, reached opposition areas near Aleppo on Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.  As part of the surrender deal, the Jaish al-Islam group that controlled the town released scores of people it had been holding.  Jaish al-Islam's departure will bring to an end the opposition presence in eastern Ghouta, giving Assad' his biggest battlefield victory since late 2016, when he took back Aleppo, and underlining his unassailable position in the war.

Syrian troops pushed the last rebel fighters out of Douma on Thursday, Major-General Yury Yevtushenko, head of Russia's Centre for Syrian Reconciliation, told local news media.  ""Today, a landmark event in the history of the Syrian Arab Republic took place,"" he was quoted as saying by the Russian agency Sputnik.  ""The state flag flown over a building Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ in the city of Douma marked the regained control over this settlement, and consequently over entire Eastern Ghouta.""  There has been no official statement from the Syrian government so far.  Russian military police have been deployed on the ground to take over Douma's security, Russian news agency RIA reported.  {articleGUID}  The developments come after Jaish al-Islam, the last remaining rebel group in Eastern Ghouta, reached a deal with Russia on Sunday under which its fighters would abandon Douma and head for an opposition-held area in northern Syria.  The agreement includes a ceasefire and the evacuation of fighters and civilians from the area.  Under the deal, only the Russian military police, and not the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, are allowed to enter Douma after the evacuation.  Crossing points will be opened to commercial movement as soon as Russian military police enter the city.  The deal also ensures the release of all pro-government prisoners held in Douma.  The agreement came a day after a suspected chemical attack killed at least 80 people and affected hundreds of other Douma residents.  Eastern Ghouta has been under government siege since 2013 as part of its so-called ""siege and starvation"" tactics.  Assad's next steps  Al Jazeera's Zena Khodr, reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon, said: ""This is no doubt a victory for the pro-government alliance because Eastern Ghouta has long been a thorn in the side of the government, right at the doorstep of the capital, Damascus, the government's seat of power.""  Pro-regime media outlets are reporting that government forces are already planning their next steps, she said.  ""There are territories and districts that are under the control of ISIL [the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group], and what we understand is that the pro-government alliance is going to focus on those districts to clear them from ISIL fighters in order to consolidate control of the capital and to put the government in a very comfortable position with help from its allies, Russia and Iran.""      Douma and Eastern Ghouta have come under heavy ground and aerial bombardment by government forces in recent weeks.  The suspected chemical attack in Douma was the largest of its kind in Syria since last April, drawing international outrage and prompting a war of words between the US and Russia.  Syria's government and Russia have denied the attack took place, but rescuers and medics have reported the deaths of dozens of people, including many women and children.  Three rival draft resolutions to investigate suspected chemical-weapons attacks in Syria failed to pass in the UN Security Council on Tuesday.  However, the OPCW will go head with its fact-finding mission to Douma to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons.  Al Jazeera's Rory Challand, reporting from Moscow, said the government takeover of Douma ""will have an impact on the OPCW fact-finding mission"".  ""The region is now directly under the control of Russian military police and the Syrian government,"" he said.  ""That might have an impact on what they find on the ground when they look for evidence of what happened last weekend.""",en,terrorattack,,

""The Israelis committed a historic mistake... and put themselves in direct combat with Iran,"" Hassan Nasrallah warned in a televised address.  Seven Iranian personnel were killed in Monday's early-morning strike on the T-4 airbase in Syria, but Teheran had not specified which units the fighters belonged to.  On Friday, Nasrallah said the casualties were elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards and said it was the first time in Syria's long-running conflict that they were intentionally hit by Israel.  ""This is unprecedented in seven years: that Israel directly targets Iran's Revolutionary Guard,"" Nasrallah said.  ""This is a turning point for the region, and what came before is not what will come after,"" he warned.  In Israel, the army said on Friday that an Iranian drone it which infiltrated the country from Syria before being shot down had been armed with explosives and was primed to carry out an attack.  Israeli warplanes had retaliated the same day, attacking the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Iranian baseÃ¢â‚¬Â inside Syria from which the drone was allegedly launched.  One of the planes was downed by Syrian air defences, crashing in Israel as its two pilots were hospitalised.  Israel is believed to have carried out numerous raids inside Syria since 2013 but it rarely admits to them publicly, although it does say it wants to curb Iranian influence in Syria.  It declined to comment on accusations by the Syrian and Russian governments that it was behind the T-4 strike.  Russian, Iranian and Hezbollah fighters have a presence at the base, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  The Observatory said a total of 14 fighters, including Iranians, died in the strike. No Russians were reported to have died.  The strike came just two days after a suspected chemical gas attack which killed more than 40 people in a rebel-controlled town outside the Syrian capital.  The alleged use of poison gas prompted US President Donald Trump and other Western leaders to threaten military action against Syria - something Nasrallah shrugged off on Friday.  ""Let the whole world know that Trump's Hollywood-style tweets and threats have not, and will not, scare Syria, Iran, Russia, or the region's resistance movements and peoples,"" he said.  Nasrallah echoed Syrian and Russian government denials that President Bashar al-Assad's forces were behind the attack.  Douma was the last rebel-controlled town in the devastated suburb of Eastern Ghouta, which Assad is now poised to declare fully in government hands after a two-month assault.

On Friday, Israel's military said that it came to the conclusion after ""flight path analysis"" and an ""intelligence-based investigation"" of the remnants.  Israel said its ""combat helicopters prevented the attack Iran had hoped to carry out in Israeli territory"".  The drone was launched from an airbase in Syria, against which Israel later carried out air strikes.  Israel lost one of its F-16 planes in the counter-offensive - a rare loss for the Israeli air force, though both crew members survived after ejecting.  The same airbase - known as T4 - came under attack again on Monday, two months after the Iranian drone was allegedly launched from the area.  Syria and Russia said the latest attack, which killed 14 people, was also carried out by Israel, which declined to comment. Seven Iranians were among those killed.  In an interview with the BBC in late February, Iran's deputy foreign minister refused to confirm that Iran had sent the drone into Israel and said that the drone belonged to the Syrian army.  It was shot down on 10 February in the country's far north, once it crossed the border.  ""It should be noted that the UAV was identified and tracked by Israeli defence systems until its destruction, effectively eliminating any threat the Iranian aircraft posed while flying towards Israeli territory,"" the Israeli military said in its statement.  Iran and Israel are long-standing enemies, and Iran has been accused of deliberately building up a force inside Syria, Israel's north-eastern neighbour.  Iran is the major regional ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  It has also been accused of supplying weaponry to Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, an enemy of Israel which has a strong force in Syria.

THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, a short time ago, I ordered the United States Armed Forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.  A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both.  Tonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action.  One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 per cent of the Syrian Air Force.  Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians - this time, in the town of Douma, near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime.  The evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children, thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man; they are crimes of a monster instead.  https://t.co/6VLQYAlcto Ã¢â‚¬â€ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2018  Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilised nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.  The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons.  Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British, and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power - military, economic, and diplomatic.  We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.  I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping, and financing the criminal Assad regime.  To Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children?  The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants, and murderous dictators.  In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons. Assad's recent attack - and today's response - are the direct result of Russia's failure to keep that promise.  Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path, or if it will join with civilised nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we'll get along with Russia, and maybe even Iran - but maybe not.  Related Story US, France and Britain launch military strikes in Syria  Related Story Six basic questions about the war in Syria  I will say this: The United States has a lot to offer, with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world.  In Syria, the United States - with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS - is doing what is necessary to protect the American people.  Over the last year, nearly 100 per cent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated.  The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment, and all of the anti-ISIS effort.  Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS.  America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home. And great warriors they are.  Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil, or act everywhere there is tyranny.  No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It's a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people.  In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of the World War I, more than one million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly spectre return.  So today, the nations of Britain, France, and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality.  Tonight, I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions.  We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace.  And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America.  Thank you, and goodnight. Thank you.",en,terrorattack,344,"['Britain', 'France', 'US', 'States', 'States', 'Top', 'Top', 'Top']"

US Secretary of Defense James Mattis said the strikes had three targets in Syria as part of an effort to ""destroy the Syrian regime's chemical weapons research, development and production capabilities"".  Here is what we know so far about the targeted sites:  1. Research centre in Damascus' Barzeh district  General Joseph Dunford, Washington's top general, said the first attack was directed at SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Scientific Studies and Research Centre in the Barzeh district outside the capital Damascus.  ""This military facility was a Syrian centre for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology,"" Dunford said after the attacks. {articleGUID}  The French military also confirmed the attack on the research facility.  SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s state news agency SANA said the attack resulted in only material damage.  The attack destroyed a building that includes a learning centre and laboratories, Syrian state TV added.  2. Weapons storage centre near Homs  The second strike targeted a storage facility west of Homs believed to produce chemical weapons, Dunford said.  Syrian state media said that missiles in the attack were intercepted by the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missile defence system.  ""The missiles that targeted a military position in Homs were thwarted and diverted from their path, and injured three civilians,"" state news agency SANA said.  3. Command post and storage facility near Homs  ""The third target, which was in the vicinity of the second target, contained both a chemical weapons equipment storage facility and an important command post,"" Dunford said.  A senior official in the regional alliance that backs Syrian government forces told Reuters news agency that Damascus had ""absorbed the strike"".  ""We had an early warning of the strike from the Russians Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and all military bases were evacuated a few days ago Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ We are carrying out an assessment of the material damages,"" the official said.  Citing a regional military alliance that supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Reuters reported the targeting of the al-Shirai airbase in al-Dimas, west of Damascus near the Lebanese border. US officials have not commented on the reports.  According to Reuters, attacks were also reported in Masyaf, about 170km north of Damascus, arms depots in the eastern Qalamoun region northeast of the capital, the Kisweh area south of Damascus and a site in the Qasyoun hills overlooking the capital.",en,terrorattack,344,"['Syria', 'US', 'UK', 'France']"

Explaining Presidential War Powers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/military-force-presidential-power.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,7/4/2017 0:00,14/4/2018 20:23,"However, while the resolution said the Security Council would impose Ã¢â‚¬Å“measuresÃ¢â‚¬Â if anyone used chemical weapons in Syria in the future, it did not directly authorize force. The chemical weapons treaty does not provide an enforcement mechanism authorizing other parties to attack violators as punishment.  Mr. TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack was different from the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bombings targeting the Islamic State in rebel-held areas of Syria. The United States has justified those airstrikes as part of the collective self-defense of Iraq, which asked for help against the group. But Syria did not use its chemical weapons against the United States or an ally like Iraq.  Could the strike be justified as a humanitarian intervention?  Some human rights advocates have argued that customary international law, which develops from the practices of states, also permits using force to stop an atrocity. Others worry that accepting such a doctrine could create a loophole that would be subject to misuse, eroding important constraints on war. The United States has not taken the position that humanitarian interventions are lawful absent Security Council authorization.  Still, in 1999, the United States participated in NATOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s air war to stop the Serbian ethnic-cleansing campaign in Kosovo, even though the operation lacked a Security Council authorization. The Clinton administration never offered a clear explanation for why that operation complied with international law. Instead, it cited a list of Ã¢â‚¬Å“factorsÃ¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€ like the threat to peace and stability and the danger of a humanitarian disaster Ã¢â‚¬â€ without offering a theory for why those factors made that war lawful. In a seeming acknowledgment that this was dubious, the administration said the Kosovo intervention should not serve as a precedent.  Did Trump have domestic legal authority to attack Syria?  The answer is murky because of a split between the apparent intent of the Constitution and how the country has been governed in practice. Most legal scholars agree that the founders wanted Congress to decide whether to go to war, except when the country is under an attack. But presidents of both parties have a long history of carrying out military operations without authorization from Congress, especially since the end of World War II, when the United States maintained a large standing army instead of demobilizing.  In the modern era, executive branch lawyers have argued that the president, as commander in chief, may use military force unilaterally if he decides a strike would be in the national interest, at least when its anticipated nature, scope and duration fall short of Ã¢â‚¬Å“a Ã¢â‚¬ËœwarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the constitutional sense,Ã¢â‚¬Â as a Clinton administration lawyer wrote in the context of a contemplated intervention in Haiti.  Video  On Thursday, Mr. Trump said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.Ã¢â‚¬Â He also invoked the Syrian refugee crisis and continuing regional instability.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who led the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department in the Bush administration, wrote that this criteria for what is sufficient to constitute a national interest was even thinner than previous precedents and would seemingly justify almost any unilateral use of force.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The interests invoked Ã¢â‚¬â€ protecting regional security and in upholding or enforcing important treaty norms Ã¢â‚¬â€ will always be present when the president is considering military intervention,Ã¢â‚¬Â he wrote. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Taken alone Ã¢â‚¬â€ and they are all we have here Ã¢â‚¬â€ these interests provide no practical limitation on presidential power.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 1973, at the end of the Vietnam War, Congress tried to reclaim some of its eroding authority by enacting the War Powers Resolution, overriding President Richard M. NixonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s veto of the law. It says a president may only introduce forces into hostilities with congressional authorization or if the United States has been attacked. But, confusingly, it also requires presidents to terminate deployments after 60 days if they lack authorization, which could suggest that one-off strikes and brief operations are allowed. Presidents of both parties have acted beyond the statuteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purported constraint about when they may launch an attack, seeing it as unconstitutionally narrow.  Just because other presidents have done it, does that make it legal?  Congress has repeatedly acquiesced to unilateral military deployments by presidents, and courts have generally stayed out of disputes about them, creating an ambiguous situation that has fueled recurring debates.  On Thursday, after news broke of Mr. TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, wrote on Twitter, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The President needs Congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution.Ã¢â‚¬Â  But earlier in the day, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, maintained on MSNBC that Mr. Trump would not need permission from Congress to strike Syria for using chemical weapons, citing as a precedent the Reagan administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1986 airstrikes against Libya after it was linked to the bombing of a Berlin disco frequented by American soldiers.  Notably, in 2013, when President Barack Obama appeared to be on the verge of striking Syria for using chemical weapons, Mr. Trump embraced Mr. PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view, writing on Twitter: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval.Ã¢â‚¬Â  What did the Obama legal team think about the legality of a Syria strike?  After Mr. Obama had warned Syria in 2012 that using chemical weapons in its civil war would cross a Ã¢â‚¬Å“red line,Ã¢â‚¬Â his legal team produced an unsigned, 17-page memo that worked through whether he would have legal authority to strike if that happened. I described that still-secret memo in my 2015 book, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Power Wars: Inside ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Post-9/11 Presidency.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In the memo, the Obama legal team struggled to come up with a rationale for why a strike against Syria in such a circumstance would be lawful. It suggested pointing to Kosovo as a precedent and came up with potential Ã¢â‚¬Å“factorsÃ¢â‚¬Â to invoke, such as assessments that using force would prevent further use of chemical weapons against civilians and that not taking action would lead to Ã¢â‚¬Å“unconscionable followÃ¢â‚¬â€˜on consequences.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Still, while the legal team stopped short of saying it would be legally necessary, it urged Mr. Obama to seek authorization from Congress, a step he had not taken in 2011 before participating in NATOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s air war over Libya.  When Syria did cross Mr. ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s red line in 2013, the case his team had anticipated was weakened because NATO decided not to participate in any strike, as the earlier memo had assumed it would do. Still, Mr. ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legal team said that a unilateral strike would be lawful.  In the end, Mr. Obama took its advice and asked Congress to authorize a punitive strike against Syria, even as he insisted that he had Ã¢â‚¬Å“the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization.Ã¢â‚¬Â Congress did not act on his request, and the immediate crisis was instead resolved without strikes after Russia brokered a deal in which Syria agreed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and give up all its stockpiles Ã¢â‚¬â€ a pledge it apparently broke.",en,terrorattack,344,"['Was', 'Syria']"

The escalation was quickly met with strong words from Syria's backers Iran and Russia, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling the strikes an ""act of aggression against a sovereign state"".  But he did not say what Moscow would do in retaliation.  The bombings in the early hours of the morning in Syria hit what the three allies said were chemical weapons sites - a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker - in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7, which killed dozens. There were no immediate reports of casualties, with Damascus' allies saying the buildings hit had been evacuated in advance.  During a United Nations Security Council meeting held at Russia's request to discuss the strikes, the US warned that it was ""locked and loaded"", ready to launch more military strikes on Syria if President Bashar al-Assad's forces carry out a new chemical weapons attack.  ""If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded,"" US Ambassador Nikki Haley said. ""When our President draws a red line, our President enforces the red line.""  Russia circulated a draft resolution calling for condemnation of the military action.  ""Russia in the most serious way condemns the attack on Syria where Russian military servicemen help the legitimate government to fight terrorism,"" Mr Putin said in a statement on the Kremlin website.  Russia, which had promised to respond to any attack on its ally, earlier said that Syrian air defences had intercepted 71 of the missiles fired. But the Pentagon said the Syrian air defence systems had been largely ineffective, and there was no indication that Russian systems had been employed.  China, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, said unilateral military action bypassing the council would ""add new complicating factors to the resolution of the Syrian issue"".  In a statement by its foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, it called for a ""return to the framework of international law"" and said it was ""opposed to the use of force"".  Announcing the military action from the White House, Mr Trump said the three allies had ""marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality"".  British Prime Minister Theresa May described the strike as ""limited and targeted"", with no intention of toppling Mr Assad or intervening more widely in the war.  She said she authorised British action after intelligence showed Mr Assad's government was to blame for the April 7 chemical attack.  The combined strike is the most significant attack against President Assad's government by Western powers in the seven years of Syria's civil war. But analysts said it remains to be seen if the attack will deter Mr Assad from using poison gas on his people again.  A US strike last year when 59 missiles were fired in response to the use of poison gas on civilians failed to deter him. But there was a clear warning that if the Assad regime resorts to chemical weapons again, then further strikes may well follow. ""We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,"" Mr Trump said in a televised address as the attacks were being carried out.  Syrian state media called the attacks a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called it a crime and the Western leaders criminals. Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were due to visit Douma yesterday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack.

Emerging onto their balconies, they watched Western strikes light up the sky over Damascus.  A photo posted on April 14, 2018 on the website of the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) shows an explosion on the outskirts of Damascus after US-led strikes on Syrian military bases and chemical research centres in and around the capital  For around 45 minutes, explosions and the sound of warplanes roared over Damascus, a stronghold of Syria's regime, as the US, France, and Britain carried out raids on military installations nearby and in the province of Homs.  ""I heard the strike and woke up. I checked the internet and read: barefaced attack by America, France, and Britain,"" said Sawsan Abu Tableh.  She and other residents described hearing a volley of fire in the morning and seeing plumes of thick smoke emerging from the city's North and East.  ""I woke up to the sound of the strike at 4am and checked the news,"" said 49-year-old Rahmeh Abu Hamra, who lives in the eastern suburb of Jarmana.  At that moment, halfway around the world, US President Donald Trump was announcing the joint military strikes on Syria.  Abu Hamra rushed out onto her balcony and saw streams of people heading down to central Damascus in an impromptu rally as day broke.  ""We don't care about Trump or a million people like him, we don't care about missiles or anything else,"" she told AFP.  Just after the barrage of strikes began, Syria announced it was activating its air defence system to block the attack.  The army said around 110 missiles were fired on Syria, but air defences shot most of them down.  'American arrogance'  Nedher Hammoud, 48, jumped out of bed at the sound of the blasts and clambered up to his rooftop.  ""I went out on my roof this morning and saw the missiles being shot down like flies,"" Mr Hammoud told AFP.  ""History will record that Syria shot down missiles -- and not just missiles. It shot down American arrogance.""  Still in his pyjamas, Mr Hammoud scrambled to join the crowds of people heading to the famed Umayyad Square to show their support for Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.  Draped in government flags and blaring patriotic tunes, dozens of Syrians arrived on bicycles, on foot and in cars spray painted with the red, white, and black colours of the Syrian flag.  A traffic jam had already started to form around the square, and young Syrians leaned out of their car windows to take selfies as military personnel looked on.  ""God is protecting you, Damascus!"" some called out, and others chanted in support of Mr Assad and the army.  Soldiers threw up two fingers to flash the victory sign near a car with pictures showing the president, his late father Hafez al-Assad and ally Hassan Nasrallah, who heads the Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah.  Car horns blared and people clapped, swaying back and forth to pro-army tunes.  ""Bashar, we're at your command! Let the world go up in flames!"" people chanted.  Amina al-Fares, 58, came to the rally dressed in black.  ""I lost my recently-married nephew, my son, my brother's children, all for Bashar al-Assad,"" she told AFP, of relatives killed in Syria's seven-year war.  Mrs Fares said she felt the bombing early in the morning when she was drinking mate, but said she was not afraid.  ""I heard the first strike, then the second, and I went out onto my balcony,"" she said.  ""Trump thought we'd be in bomb shelters, but here we are in Umayyad Square.""

Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attends the BBC's Marr Show in London, April 15, 2018. Jeff Overs/BBC handout via REUTERS  U.S., French and British missile attacks struck at the heart of SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chemical weapons programme on Saturday in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week ago, and the three countries insisted they were not aimed at toppling President Bashar al-Assad or intervening in a seven-year civil war.  The bombings, hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a success but denounced by Damascus and its allies as an act of aggression, marked the biggest intervention by Western countries against Assad and his ally Russia, whose foreign minister Sergei Lavrov called them Ã¢â‚¬Å“unacceptable and lawlessÃ¢â‚¬Â.  In Damascus, SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad met inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW for about three hours in the presence of Russian officers and a senior Syrian security official.  The inspectors were due to try to visit the site of the suspected gas attack. Moscow condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for their findings before attacking.  As he left the hotel where the meeting took place, Mekdad declined to comment to reporters waiting outside.  British Foreign Secretary (Minister) Boris Johnson defended Prime Minister Theresa MayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision to take part in the attack, saying it was to deter further use of chemical weapons.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is not about regime change Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ This is not about trying to turn the tide of the conflict in Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told the BBC.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is no proposal on the table at the moment for further attacks because so far thank heavens the Assad regime have not been so foolish as to launch another chemical weapons attack.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If and when such a thing were to happen, then clearly with allies we would study what the options were,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, echoing U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who told an emergency Security Council meeting that Trump told her that if Syria uses poisonous gas again, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The United States is locked and loaded.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Asked if this meant Assad could carry on using barrel bombs and other means in the war provided he did not use chemical weapons, Johnson said that that was the Ã¢â‚¬Å“unhappyÃ¢â‚¬Â consequence.  Assad was determined Ã¢â‚¬Å“to butcher his wayÃ¢â‚¬Â to an overwhelming victory and only the Russians could pressure him to come to the negotiating table in Geneva, Johnson said.  British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the legal basis used to support the British role was debatable, adding that he would only support action backed by the UN Security Council.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I say to the foreign secretary, I say to the prime minister, where is the legal basis for this?Ã¢â‚¬Â Corbyn said in an interview with the BBC.  A woman walks near a picture of Syrian President Bashar al Assad in Damascus, Syria April 15, 2018. REUTERS/Ali Hashisho  The Western countries blame AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7 that killed up to 75 people. Russia, whose ties with the West have sunk to levels of the Cold War-era, denies any gas attack in Douma and said Britain staged it to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“RESILIENCEÃ¢â‚¬Â  In Damascus, Assad told a group of visiting Russian lawmakers that the Western missile strikes were an act of aggression, Russian news agencies reported.  Syria released video of the wreckage of a bombed-out research lab, but also of Assad arriving at work as usual, with the caption Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morning of resilienceÃ¢â‚¬Â and there were no immediate reports of casualties.  The Russian agencies quoted the lawmakers as saying Assad was in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“good moodÃ¢â‚¬Â, had praised the Soviet-era air defence systems Syria used to repel the Western attacks and had accepted an invitation to visit Russia at an unspecified time.  Russian Foreign Ministry official Vladimir Ermakov struck a apparently conciliatory tone on Sunday, saying Washington would want to maintain a dialogue with Moscow about strategic stability after the raids, Russian media reported.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the U.S. administration there are specific people who it is possible to talk with,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ermakov, head of the ministryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s department for non-proliferation and arms control.  President Trump had said Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mission accomplishedÃ¢â‚¬Â on Twitter on Saturday following the strikes, although U.S. Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie at the Pentagon acknowledged elements of the programme remain and he could not guarantee that Syria would be unable to conduct a chemical attack in the future.  Slideshow (2 Images)  Russian and Iranian military help over the past three years has allowed Assad to crush the rebel threat to topple him.  The United States, Britain and France have all participated in the Syrian conflict for years, arming rebels, bombing Islamic State fighters and deploying troops to fight the militants. But they have refrained from targeting AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government, apart from a volley of U.S. missiles last year.  RED LINE BREACHED?  The strikes suggest Trump may have reset AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s red line for military intervention in Syria over the use of chemical weapons.  In Washington, a senior administration official said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“while the available information is much greater on the chlorine use, we do have significant information that also points to sarin useÃ¢â‚¬Â in the attack.  Sarin had previously appeared to be the threshold for intervention. Chlorine, in contrast, has been used more widely in SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conflict without past U.S. reprisals, and the chemical is far easier to find and weaponise, experts say.  Washington described the strike targets as a centre near Damascus for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons; a chemical weapons storage site near the city of Homs; and another site near Homs that stored chemical weapons equipment and housed a command post.  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the attack a crime and the Western leaders criminals, while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all Security Council members to use restraint, but said charges of chemical weapons use demand investigation.  Meanwhile, Pope Francis called on world leaders to renew efforts to bring peace to Syria, saying he was deeply troubled by their failure to agree on a joint plan to end the bloodshed.

Experts arrived in Damascus on Saturday, but they have been unable to visit the nearby town of Douma because of ""security issues"" cited by Russia.  US officials have raised concerns that Russia, the Syrian government's ally, might have tampered with the site.  The government insists the incident in Douma on 7 April was fabricated.  Opposition activists, medical organisations and rescue workers say more than 40 people were killed when aircraft dropped barrel bombs filled with toxic chemicals on the town while it was still held by rebel forces.

Syrian state media is reporting that inspectors have arrived in Douma but this has not been confirmed by the OPCW.  Russian and Syrian officials had cited ""pending security issues"" for not allowing inspectors to travel to the site of the alleged attack, the global watchdog's director general said on Monday.  Syrian authorities had instead offered the inspectors the chance to interview 22 people who they said were at the location of the alleged attack and could be brought to Damascus for interviews, according to Ahmet Uzumcu.  Fears of tampering  If the OPCW inspectors are able to travel to Douma on Wednesday, it will have been 11 days since the attack. They are expected to gather soil and other samples to help identify any chemicals that might have been used.  US ambassador Kenneth Ward said at an OPCW meeting at The Hague on Monday that there were fears that Russian forces had tampered with the site after the last rebel fighters were evacuated last week, Reuters news agency reported.  ""It is our understanding the Russians may have visited the attack site,"" Mr Ward was quoted as saying.

He said the allegations of chemical weapons use were ""based on media reports and social media"" and that the incident was ""staged"".  The Syrian government denies ever having used chemical weapons.  However, experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war, including an attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that involved the nerve agent Sarin.

Seth Doane spoke to residents of a building where at least 30 bodies are reported to have been found.  ""All of a sudden some gas spread around us,"" one man said. ""We couldn't breathe, it smelled like chlorine.""  Another resident, who said many members of his family were among those killed, showed the CBS crew a yellow compressed gas canister that appeared to have punched a hole in the roof of the building. The canister looked similar to others photographed in the wake of other alleged chlorine attacks.  A Swedish journalist who also visited the building in Douma said he felt a discomfort in his throat and smelled a strong odour as he entered its basement.  What happened in Douma?  The day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma still under rebel control - the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus.  Thousands of people were sheltering in basements from the government's bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations.  The World Health Organization said that according to reports from its medical partners in Douma, an estimated 500 patients presented to health facilities exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals.  There were signs of severe irritation of mucous membranes, respiratory failure and disruption to central nervous systems of those exposed, it added.  More than 70 people sheltering in basements reportedly died, with 43 of those deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals, the WHO said.  Catch up on the aftermath of the air strikes  The military response  Late on Friday night in Washington, President Donald Trump announced that he had authorised strikes against Syrian military targets, in co-ordination with the UK and France.  The US military said 105 missiles were launched, and claimed the strikes had set back Syria's alleged chemical weapons programme by years.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch the key moments over 12 hours - in two minutes  Russia said 71 of the missiles were shot down by Syrian air defence systems.  One of the three sites hit was a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) in the capital's Barzeh district, which the US said was a ""centre for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology"".  The other two were suspected chemical weapons storage facilities at Him Shinshar, west of the city of Homs.  Nikki Haley, the US permanent representative to the UN, said on Sunday that the Trump administration would sanction Russian companies she alleged were involved in Syria's chemical weapons programme.  But the White House contradicted her on Monday, rejecting any fresh sanctions.  ""We are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future,"" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.  Defiance on Syria's national day  By Lyse Doucet in Aleppo  Syria's national day, its annual celebration of independence, has added resonance this year. Western air strikes have hardened the defiance of pro-government supporters and their long-held conviction that Syria is the target of a Western conspiracy.  The Syrian army's victory in the Eastern Ghouta, the last major rebel enclave around Damascus, has also strengthened President Assad's resolve to finish this war on the battlefield rather than at any negotiating table.  A major concert on Tuesday in Aleppo's majestic citadel, organised by the presidency to mark national day, is meant to sound a loud clear note that the Syrian leader is calling the tune.  Ever since Aleppo was recaptured at the end of 2016, Western and Arab envoys have expressed hope that Russia would exert pressure on its Syrian ally to try to bring about a negotiated solution. That was always in doubt. And this new crisis has now put the West's relationship with Russia at breaking point.",en,terrorattack,344,['Syria']

The satellite images show several Syrian military bases that are used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards forces, which the IDF's said helps illustrate the threats imposed by the Iranian ability to send weapons to Syria from Tehran.  The Guard's air force presence is located in five airports in Syria: T4, Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor, Damascus International Airport and an additional airfield south east of Damascus, according to the IDF.  The intelligence was released after an eventful night in Syria during which Syrian air defense missile systems went off for reasons which are still unclear.  Rumors of an Israeli attack eventually gave way to officials saying the threat was a false alarm.  Tension on Israel's northern borders remains very high in light of the American attack against the Assad chemical weapons facilities last Friday and the expectation of Iranian retaliation for a separate strike attributed to Israel.  RUSSIA, SYRIA BLOCK INSPECTORS FROM CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK SITE, WATCHDOG SAYS  On Monday, The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman quoted a senior IDF official as admitting Israeli responsibility for the attack last week, a step that Israel has officially refrained from taking so far.  As of Tuesday morning, several Israeli websites received details of wide-ranging information about the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' aerial systems in Syria, whose officers and advisers were killed in the recent attack.  One of the photos shows the Syria military base in Deir ez-Zor located in eastern Syria. One of the photographs appears to show Ilyushin planes transporting weapons from Iran to Syria, according to the IDF.  The photos released Tuesday illustrate how Tehran is capable of delivering surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) and unarmed aerial vehicles (UAV) to Syria, Israeli military sources told Fox News.  ""Israel will react strongly to any Iranian action from inside Syria,"" a senior IDF source said, adding that Iran plans to attack Israel from Syria and gain control of the Arab state though its air force.

Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were convicted of one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of conspiracy against civil rights. Wright was convicted of a charge of lying to the FBI. Sentencing is set for June 27.  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the verdicts a significant victory against domestic terrorism and hate crimes.  ""The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin,"" Sessions said in a news release. ""That's not just illegal Ã¢â‚¬â€ it's immoral and unacceptable, and we're not going to stand for it.""  Defense attorneys declined to comment following the verdict.  The three men were indicted in October 2016 for plotting an attack for the day after the presidential election in the meatpacking town of Garden City, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) west of Wichita.  U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister told reporters that the jury's verdicts represent ""a victory for the rule of law and national security.""  Prosecutors have said that a fellow militia member, Dan Day, became alarmed by some of his colleagues' threats and agreed to wear a wire as a paid informant. The government's case featured months of profanity-laced recordings in which militia members discussed plans and referred to the Somalis as ""cockroaches.""  ""That confidential source is also to be commended for doing the right thing and the courage he demonstrated,"" McAllister said.  Wright is captured in one recording saying he hoped an attack on the Somalis would ""wake people up"" and inspire others to take similar action against Muslims.  ""We welcome the guilty verdicts in this disturbing case and hope that anyone considering turning bigoted views into violent actions will see what their fate will be when apprehended and prosecuted by law enforcement authorities,"" said Moussa Elbayoumy, chairman of the Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.  The government argued that the men formed a splinter group of the militia Kansas Security Force that came to be known as ""the Crusaders."" The testimony and recordings indicate the men tried to recruit other members of the Kansas Security Force to join them.  According to prosecutors, Stein was recorded discussing the type of fuel and fertilizer bomb that Timothy McVeigh used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people. Stein was arrested when he delivered 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of fertilizer to undercover FBI agents to make explosives.  Attorneys for the defense said the FBI set up the men with a paid informant and all the talk about violence wasn't serious. They said the men had a right to free speech and association under the U.S. Constitution.  Prosecutors argued that the plot was more than just words.  The men discussed obtaining vehicles and filling them with explosives and parking them at the four corners of the apartment complex to create an explosion that would bring down and level the entire complex, McAllister said. They downloaded recipes from the internet and they experimented with and tested those explosives.",en,terrorattack,,

No one was hurt this time around as the two or three rockets exploded outside the U.N. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Super CampÃ¢â‚¬Â in Timbuktu and a nearby French base, an army spokesman told Reuters.  Youba Cisse, a trader in Timbuktu, told Reuters he heard at least three loud detonations coming from the direction of the camp. The U.N. mission, known as MINUSMA, could not immediately be reached for comment.  The April 14 car bomb and rocket attacks on the heavily fortified bases by militants disguised as U.N. peacekeepers killed one U.N. peacekeeper from Burkina Faso and wounded seven French troops.  The raid, for which al QaeadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s local affiliate JNIM claimed responsibility, marked a particularly daring assault amid an upsurge in jihadist violence in Mali and neighbouring countries.  FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defence ministry said at least 15 assailants were killed when it scrambled fighter jets and attack helicopters to respond.  U.N. peacekeeping and French military forces in northern Mali have faced near-constant attack over the past year by determined and well-armed jihadist groups seen as the gravest threat to security across West AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sahel region.  Western-backed operations against the groups have inflicted significant casualties, yet the jihadists have savvily exploited political and ethnic tensions to recruit new members.

Online messages from Islamic State propagandists viewed by Reuters say Bahrumsyah, an Indonesian national, died after US air strikes hit Hajin, north of the Syrian city of Abu Kamal, last Tuesday.  A spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, said the embassy in Syria had made enquiries but had yet to confirm Bahrumsyah's death.  Two senior Indonesian counter-terrorism officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were taking the online reports seriously.  ""We are in the process of investigating,"" said one senior official with Indonesia's counter-terrorism agency.  If the reports were true, it would become a ""motivation to carry out reprisal attacks"" in Indonesia, the senior official said.  A Pentagon spokesman, Eric Pahon, said US aircraft were bombing the ""general area"" in eastern Syria on the day Bahrumsyah is believed to have died but was unable to confirm his death.  As well as leading Katibah Nusantara, an armed unit comprising more than 100 Southeast Asians, Bahrumsyah also organised funding for the Islamist rebels who captured part of the southern Philippines city of Marawi in a bloody siege last year, analysts and officials say.  A message purportedly from the Islamic State figure Abu Nuh reviewed by Reuters said Bahrumsyah had been attending a meeting of leaders when he was killed. An Islamic State headquarters and a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device factory were destroyed in the attack, the message said.  Another post eulogized the Indonesian, receiving sympathetic comments and crying emojis.  There were reports last year of Bahrumsyah's death, but analyst Sidney Jones from the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict said the latest had a ""much higher degree of credibility"".  ""As far as we know, he was the highest ranking Indonesian to fight with ISIS. The fact that he commanded a fighting unit that was recognised by ISIS underscores his importance,"" said Jones, using an alternative acronym for Islamic State.  His death, if confirmed, would be a blow to pro-Islamic State forces in Southeast Asia, where fears of hardened fighters returning from Syria as the militants' self-declared caliphate crumbles has authorities on alert.  More than 600 Indonesians, including at least 166 women and children, travelled to Syria to join Islamic State, according to data from Indonesia's counter-terrorism agency reviewed by Reuters.  A further 482 Indonesians were deported by foreign governments trying to join IS.

Saleh Nasser Fadhl al-Bakshi held the title of ""Prince"" for the Aden area in the militant group's Yemen affiliate, which has killed hundreds of people, mostly security forces in the country's south, in years of bombing and shooting attacks.  Counterterrorism forces surrounded al-Bakhshi in a building, according to a statement on the Aden police Facebook page, when he and fellow militants refused to surrender.  In the ensuing shootout, one of the counter-terrorism force members was killed along with al-Bakshi, whose bloodied corpse was displayed in a picture accompanying the police statement.  Three of his comrades were arrested, it added.  Islamic State gained a foothold in Yemen late in 2014 as the country collapsed into civil war between the armed Houthi movement and the internationally recognised government, opening a security vacuum and sparking Saudi-led military intervention.

A man suspected of carrying out the attack is alleged to be a former student taking revenge for having been bullied at the school.  The assault took place near Mizhi County Number Three secondary school in Shaanxi province as the students were heading home for the day.  The suspect remains in custody.  Chinese police have given his surname as Zhao and say he is 28.  Their preliminary assessment is that he was motivated to take revenge because he was bullied in his third year (where students are typically aged 13-14).  Police say the dead are seven girls and two boys.  Photos on social media showed several young students lying on the ground in Yulin city, surrounded by shocked onlookers.  The attack happened at the school at around 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) on Friday, a local government statement said.  The injured children are receiving treatment in hospital.  Their exact ages have not been given but reports suggest they may be middle school children, which would make them aged 12 to 15.

The attacks, a week after 60 people were killed as they waited at a voter registration centre in the city, underlined mounting insecurity despite repeated government pledges to tighten defences.  Hours after the attack in Kabul, a suicide bomber in a vehicle attacked a foreign military convoy in the southern province of Kandahar, killing 11 children studying in a nearby religious school, police said.  ""These attacks caused untold human suffering to Afghan families,"" said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan.  ""I am furthermore outraged by the attack which appears to have deliberately targeted journalists,"" he said in a statement.  The attacks in rapid succession were a grim reminder of the strength of both the Taliban and Islamic State's emerging Afghanistan branch to wreak violence despite stepped up U.S. air attacks under Trump's new policy for the 16-year-old war.  Taliban militants, fighting to restore their version of strict Islamic law to Afghanistan, announced their usual spring offensive last week and there has been heavy fighting in several areas of the country since.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the two blasts in the capital, which killed at least 26 people, including four police, and wounded 49 seriously, Hashmat Stanekzai, a senior police official, said.  The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AFJSC) said nine journalists were killed in Kabul, the worst toll for media workers in a single attack in the country.  Najib Danish, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said a suicide bomber appeared to have posed as a media worker and blew himself up where reporters and rescue workers had gathered.  ""We know that a suicide bomber pretended to be a reporter. He showed his press card and stood among journalists before blowing himself up,"" Danish told Reuters.  'VERY DANGEROUS' WORKING ENVIRONMENT  Afghanistan was already considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, with at least 20 killed last year. Last week, unidentified gunmen shot a journalist in the southern city of Kandahar.  Monday's attack was the most serious on the Afghan media since 2016, when seven workers for Tolo News were killed in an attack claimed by the Taliban.  Eight of the journalists were from Afghan outlets: two reporters from the Mashal TV, a cameraman and a reporter working for 1TV, three reporters from Radio Azadi and one from Tolo News, the AFJSC said.  The French news agency Agence France-Presse said its chief photographer in Afghanistan, Shah Marai, was killed.  A Reuters photographer was slightly hurt by shrapnel.  ""Journalists were doing their job when a suicide bomber killed them, such attacks prove that the working environment is very dangerous now,"" said Rahimullah Samandar, a senior member of the AFJSC.  The reporters had arrived to cover the initial blast in the Shashdarak area close to buildings of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) intelligence service and near to the U.S. embassy.  Held back by police, they were waiting some distance away near the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, when the second explosion went off just as people were entering the government office.  Hundreds of people have been killed and wounded in a series of attacks in Kabul since the beginning of the year, despite President Ashraf Ghani's offer in February for peace talks ""without preconditions"".  In the southern city of Kandahar, where NATO-led forces operate out of a big air base, 11 children were killed and 16 wounded when a suicide bomber drove his explosive-laden van into a foreign-force convoy, police said.  The 11 children who were killed were studying in a nearby madrassa, or religious school, said Matiullah Zhman, a spokesman for Kandahar police. In addition eight members of the NATO-led Resolute Support coalition were wounded, the force said.

NEW YORK: The number of Americans sickened each year by bites from infected mosquitoes, ticks or fleas tripled from 2004 through 2016, with infection rates spiking sharply in 2016 as a result of a Zika outbreak, U.S. health officials said on Tuesday.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that some 96,075 diseases caused by bites by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas were reported in 2016, up from 27,388 in 2004, in an analysis of data from the CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.  Infections in 2016 went up 73 percent from 2015, reflecting the emergence of Zika, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause severe birth defects. Zika was the most common disease borne by ticks, mosquitoes and fleas reported in 2016, with 41,680 cases reported, followed by Lyme disease, with 36,429 cases, almost double the number in 2004.  The increases may be a result of climate change, with increased temperatures and shorter winters boosting populations of ticks, mosquitoes and other disease-carrying creatures known as ""vectors.""  ""It enables these ticks to expand to new areas. Where there are ticks, there comes diseases,"" said Lyle Petersen, director of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases.  Warmer summer temperatures also tend to bring outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses, Petersen said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  While Zika stood out as the latest emerging threat in the report, it also showed a long-term increase in cases of tick-borne Lyme disease, which can attack the heart and nervous system if left untreated.  Researchers warned that their numbers likely do not include every case as many infections are not reported.  These increases are due to many factors, including growing populations of the insects that transmit them and increased exposure outside of the United States by travelers who unknowingly transport diseases back home.  The CDC said more than 80 percent of vector-control organizations across the United States lack the capacity to prevent and control these fast-spreading, demanding illnesses. Petersen said that federal programs are increasing funding for those organizations.  (Reporting by Gina Cherelus; editing by Scott Malone and Grant McCool)",en,diseas,,

More than a dozen were hurt in the explosions in the town of Mubi on Tuesday.  Abdullahi Yerima, police commissioner in Adamawa state, said a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the mosque at about 1pm (12:00 GMT) and a second bomber exploded a device 200 metres away as worshippers fled, Reuters news agency reported.  ""As I am talking to you now, 24 persons are confirmed dead and the scene is cordoned off by anti-bomb squads and other security personnel,"" state police spokesman Othman Abubakar was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.  Two local residents who had attended the funerals of the victims told AFP news agency that more than 60 people were killed in the attack.  It was the second time in six months that dozens have been killed in an attack on a Mubi mosque. Last November, a teenage suicide bomber attacked worshippers as they gathered for morning prayers, killing at least 50 people in one of the region's deadliest assaults in years.  Haruna Hamman Furo, the head of the Adamawa state emergency management agency, described Tuesday's attack as ""devastating"".  Roof 'blown off'  Residents said they saw a young man wearing a suicide vest entering the mosque with the worshippers.  Isa Danladi said he was about to leave his house near the mosque when he heard the blast.  ""The mosque roof was blown off and the prayer was midway when the bomber, who was obviously in the congregation, detonated his explosives,"" Danladi said. ""This is obviously the work of Boko Haram.""  There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the blasts bore the hallmarks of the armed Boko Haram group, which has waged a deadly campaign of violence in Africa's most populous country since 2009, and often deploys suicide bombers in crowded places.  More than 20,000 people have been killed in the insurgency, which has also forced some two million to flee their homes.  Boko Haram held territory in Adamawa state in 2014, but troops pushed the group out in early 2015 and Mubi was relatively peaceful until the suicide bomb attack in November 2017 that killed 50 people.  Insecurity has become a politically charged subject in the run-up to a national election next year that President Muhammadu Buhari - who took office in 2015 with a promise to end Boko Haram's push to create an Islamic state in the northeast - has said he wants to contest.  Reporting from Abuja, Al Jazeera's Jamela Alindogan said the attack came at a ""critical time"".  ""The Nigerian army launched an intensive operation around Lake Chad where it is believed that Boko Haram members with allegiance and connections to ISIL are based out of,"" she said.  ""The Nigerian army has put a deadline to finish the presence of the Boko Haram group in at least about four months, but many question whether that's possible given that the majority of the focus is on a military solution and not on a societal one.""",en,terrorattack,370,['Nigeria']

Scenes of bloodshed and devastation have become common in northeast Nigeria, where a jihadist insurgency has raged since 2009  The blasts happened at about 1.20pm (7.20pm Thailand time) in Mubi, a city some 200km from the Adamawa state capital, Yola.  Adamawa state police spokesman Othman Abubakar said, ""For now (the death toll) is 24,"" but other sources gave far higher figures.  Rescue worker Sani Kakale said: ""In my presence, 42 dead bodies were taken to hospital and 68 injured."" A source at Mubi General Hospital told AFP they had ""so far"" received 37 bodies and dozens of injured, many of them critically.  Suspicion immediately fell on Boko Haram, the jihadist group whose quest to establish a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria has left at least 20,000 dead since 2009.  Mubi has been repeatedly targeted in attacks blamed on Boko Haram since it was briefly overrun by the militants in late 2014.  Nigeria's government and military have long maintained that the Islamic State group affiliate is a spent force and on the verge of defeat.  But there has been no let-up in attacks in the northeast, particularly in Borno state, adjacent to Adamawa, which has been the epicentre of the violence.  Last Thursday, at least four people were killed when suicide bombers and fighters attempted to storm the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, raising fresh questions about security.  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has been in the United States this week and met his US counterpart Donald Trump, who pledged more support in the fight against Boko Haram.  Nigeria has bought a dozen A-29 Super Tucano light fighter aircraft in a $496-million (413-million-euro) deal. Trump indicated a further order for attack helicopters was also in the pipeline.  ""These new aircraft will improve Nigeria's ability to target terrorists and protect civilians,"" Trump told a joint news conference with Buhari in Washington on Monday.  - Chaotic scenes -  In Mubi, local volunteer Habu Saleh, who was involved in the rescue effort, described the situation as ""chaos all over the place"".  ""We have evacuated dozens of dead and injured people to the hospital and the rescue operation is still ongoing,"" he said.  Health workers from the hospital mobilised to attend to the victims, despite being on strike over pay and conditions.  Mubi resident Abdullahi Labaran said the first bomber mingled with worshippers who had gathered for prayers at the mosque at the edge of the market.  He detonated his explosives ""five minutes before the prayer started"", he added.  The second bomber blew himself up among the crowds of worshippers, traders and shoppers who fled the mosque towards the butchery section of a nearby market.  On November 21, 2017 at least 50 people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque during early morning prayers in the Unguwar Shuwa area of Mubi.  In October 2012, at least 40 people were killed in an attack on student housing in Mubi that was widely blamed on Boko Haram.  In June 2014, at least 40 football supporters, including women and children, died in a bomb attack after a match in the Kabang area of the town.",en,terrorattack,370,['Nigeria']

Ten Afghan journalists -- including AFP Afghanistan chief photographer Shah Marai Faizi -- were killed in Monday's attacks, sparking outrage around the world  Ten journalists were killed Monday, including Agence France-Presse chief photographer Shah Marai, in attacks that sparked outrage around the world and underscored the dangers faced by Afghan media.  The deadly assaults have rocked Afghanistan's tight-knit journalist community. Many of them are close friends as well as colleagues who look out for one another as they work in an increasingly hostile environment.  Hours after the double suicide blast in Kabul that killed nine journalists and 16 others, dozens of Afghan news editors and executives gathered at the site in a public display of defiance to militants.  The message was ""if they destroy a line of journalists, there's going to be a longer line back at the scene within a few hours,"" Tolo News director Lotfullah Najafizada told AFP.  Tolo News cameraman Yar Mohammad Tokhi was among the journalists killed in the explosion that also wounded 49 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group.  Journalists from 1TV, Radio Free Europe and Mashal TV were also among the dead.  Police said a bomber had disguised himself as a journalist and blew himself up among the media covering the first blast near Afghanistan's intelligence agency.  Media outlets condemned the government's failure to provide security for journalists, particularly at the scene of attacks where secondary blasts are a constant concern.  ""They (security forces) cordon off the area and journalists are left behind the line with the public,"" Najafizada said.  - 'We will not stop' -  Many journalists expressed determination to continue their work despite the threats.  ""Our message is that we are ready, we are not afraid of such attacks and we will stand for freedom of speech and democracy in Afghanistan,"" said Hamid Haidari, acting head of the news department at 1TV, which lost a reporter and a cameraman in the assault.  ""We know this kind of attack will happen (again) in the future... but we will not stop, we will continue.  ""It was a tough time (yesterday). But we stand against such barbaric acts.""  The 10th journalist killed Monday was BBC reporter Ahmad Shah, who died in a separate attack in the eastern province of Khost.  The attacks came days after gunmen shot dead an Afghan journalist in the southern city of Kandahar.  Afghanistan was last year ranked the third most dangerous country in the world for journalists by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).  The media watchdog said since 2016, it has recorded the killings of 34 journalists in Afghanistan.  ""We are determined to work for press freedom and keep informing people,"" Parwiz Kawa, editor-in-chief of the Hasht-e-Subh Daily newspaper, told AFP.  The newspaper published a black front page with photos of the nine journalists killed in Kabul. The last time it did so was in 2016 when seven Tolo News employees were killed in a Taliban suicide bombing.  ""There's a level of commitment inside (Afghan) media outlets... who are mainly composed of young and educated people and they think they have a social responsibility to work and keep going,"" Kawa added.  But there are fears the repeated attacks on the media and the perception that militants are deliberately targeting them, will frighten some journalists into quitting.  ""Some of our journalists have already left work and changed jobs because of increasing security threats,"" Waliullah Rahmani, director of Khabarnama Media, told AFP.  Freelance journalist Zakarya Hassani said he was under pressure from his family to stop working in the media.  ""Since yesterday evening I have received a lot of phone calls asking me to quit, 'please leave your job or it will take you from us',"" Hassani told AFP.  ""But this is not the solution and so far the answer is no.""  But Ahmad Farid Halimi told AFP he had resigned from his job at TV channel Kabul News after the attack.  ""Last night my wife was crying when I came home, she was telling me 'you are not safe with this job',"" he told AFP.  ""I don't know what I will do in the future but I don't want to be killed for my work.""",en,terrorattack,,

Mainly Muslim Tunisia is home to one of North Africa's largest Jewish communities. Though they now number less than 2,000 people, Jews have lived in Tunisia since Roman times.  In 2011, after the uprising that toppled former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali the annual celebration was cancelled, and in following years only a few hundred attended, fearing attacks by hardline Islamists.  This year, revellers chanted and danced in a two-day pilgrimage to the El Ghriba synagogue at the popular tourist island resort of Djerba 500 km (310 miles) south of Tunis.  ""The security situation is excellent here and this has encouraged us to come back ... Today we feel safer in Tunisia than in Paris,"" Isabel Guez, a Jewish visitor from Paris, told Reuters.  ""This celebration is a great opportunity for approchement between Muslims, Jews and other religions and an opportunity to call for peace and love across the world,"" she added.  Some 5,000 pilgrims attended, organisers said, a significant increase on 2,000 last year. Tunisia has not seen a major militant attack since scores of foreigners were killed in two strikes claimed by Islamic State in 2015.  Hundreds of pilgrims prayed, lit candles and wrote wishes on eggs. Others celebrated by sipping glasses of boukha, a liqueur made from figs.  In 2002 militants linked to al Qaeda attacked the synagogue with a truck bomb killing 21 Western tourists.  Authorities took no chances this time with hundreds of police, soldiers and members of anti-terror units patrolling streets. Checkpoints were set up around the synagogue.  ""With the good security situation now, the number of visitors exceeds 5,000 from Israel, Russia and Europe,"" said Perez Trabelsi, the head of the Jewish community in Djerba.  The El Ghriba synagogue, home to most of Tunisia's Jews, is built on the site of a Jewish temple that is believed to date back almost 1,900 years.

Francisco Franco.  Photo  It turned to violence in opposing the Franco government, which suppressed opponents and banned minority cultures and languages, including that spoken by the Basques. The groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods at first drew support from a wide range of FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opponents.  But it continued to rely on terrorism even after Franco had died, Spain had returned to democracy, and the central government had granted significant autonomy to the Basque region and others.  ETAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s use of violence backfired, ensuring now that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Basque secessionist project will not make any substantial progress until the legacy of deaths and economic losses becomes a distant memory,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Diego Muro, a Spanish lecturer in international relations at the Handa Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland.  He said the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dissolution Ã¢â‚¬Å“brings to an end the ethnonationalist wave of terrorism that started with the anti-colonialist violence of the second half of the 20th century.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In its letter, ETA wrote that a Ã¢â‚¬Å“lack of will to solve the conflictÃ¢â‚¬Â had prolonged it, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“multiplied the suffering,Ã¢â‚¬Â and acknowledged that the group was at least partly to blame.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ETA recognizes the suffering caused as a result of their struggle,Ã¢â‚¬Â it added.  In June 1968, two ETA militants killed a policeman who had stopped them to check their papers and inspect their car Ã¢â‚¬â€ the first death attributed to the group. Two months later, it carried out its first planned assassination, ambushing a police inspector, MelitÃƒÂ³n Manzanas Ã¢â‚¬â€ who was suspected of torturing communists who resisted Franco Ã¢â‚¬â€ outside his home in IrÃƒÂºn, on the French border.  Photo  In 1973, ETA struck at the top of FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government, killing the prime minister, Adm. Luis Carrero Blanco, with a bomb so powerful that the explosion sent his armored limousine flying over a building. The assassination left Franco, who had only two years to live, without an obvious successor.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As Spain transitioned to democracy after FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, a law enacted in 1977 granted amnesty for crimes committed during the civil war of the 1930s and FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subsequent dictatorship. Spain also began a process of political decentralization that gave regions their own parliaments and significant powers over areas like education and health. The Basque region and a neighbor, Navarre, also received the important right to collect taxes.  But ETA rejected such political concessions and instead stepped up its terror campaign demanding an independent state it called Euskal Herria. The group envisioned a nation that would stretch far beyond the modern borders of SpainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Basque region, to include Navarre and the Basque region of southwest France.

In 1987, in its worst single attack, an ETA bomb killed 21 people at a Barcelona supermarket.  By then, each attack provoked a national outcry. In July 1997, six million people took to the streets to protest the assassination of Miguel ÃƒÂngel Blanco, a local conservative politician, who was kidnapped and killed by ETA.  Starting in the late 1980s, ETA announced several cease-fires and occasionally held talks with the Spanish government, first under the conservative prime minister JosÃƒÂ© MarÃƒÂ­a Aznar, and then under the Socialist administration led by JosÃƒÂ© Luis RodrÃƒÂ­guez Zapatero. But the negotiations and cease-fires repeatedly broke down, while the Spanish government continued to ban politicians seen as being linked to ETA from running in elections.  Photo  Then, after the arrests of many ETA leaders and operatives, the violence stopped. ETA last killed someone on Spanish soil in 2009, and its last victim anywhere was a French policeman, shot in 2010 during a botched car theft near Paris.  The group announced another cease-fire in October 2011, and this one held. Last year, it offered to disarm itself, and disclosed the locations of some of its weapons caches.  Even as the government dealt with the emergency of another secessionist movement, this one in Catalonia, the Spanish authorities, working in close cooperation with French and other police forces, continued to arrest ETA members and seize hidden weapons. Security experts say the group has been so depleted that it can no longer carry out operations.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Since the 2011 cease-fire, the conservative government has rejected international mediation efforts, determined not to allow ETA a brokered deal like the one that ended hostilities in Northern Ireland between the British government and the Irish Republican Army. The Spanish government fears that ETA members and sympathizers could score political points with a negotiated surrender.  Last month, SpainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, warned that ETA would not win any concessions in return for dissolving itself. One of the outstanding issues is whether the government will transfer imprisoned ETA members, who are scattered across the rest of Spain, to prisons in the Basque region.  ETA Ã¢â‚¬Å“didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get anything for stopping to kill and will not get anything for declaring its disappearance,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mr. Zoido said.

Officials at first said five crewmembers were killed, but it later emerged that other people were also on board.  ""We've confirmed nine people, consisting of five crewmembers and four additional passengers"" were on board, Puerto Rico National Guard spokesman Major Paul Dahlen said.  He said the four others were also members of the military.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Dahlen could not immediately confirm all nine had died, but said images of the crash spoke for themselves.

The C-130 had been in Georgia for planned maintenance and was thought to have been in good mechanical condition, he added.  An investigation into the incident is underway.  The US military has been rocked by a string of aviation accidents in recent weeks, including an F-16 crash near Las Vegas last month that killed the pilot.  Just a day earlier, four crew members died when a Marine Corps helicopter crashed while on a routine training mission in Southern California.  And in Djibouti, two incidents triggered the grounding of US military flights.  According to the Military Times, accidents involving the military's manned aircraft rose nearly 40 per cent from fiscal years 2013 to 2017.  The publication found the rise coincided with budget cuts from 2013, which impacted training and readiness, as well as heavy wear and tear on aircraft from back-to-back deployments.",en,terrorattack,371,['US']

""Zero hour for the liberation of Derna has struck. Our army forces are now targeting their hideouts,"" Haftar said in a speech at a military parade in Benghazi.  ""We have given instructions to avoid civilians,"" he said. ""The peace efforts in Derna have reached a dead end.""  Derna is the last major bastion of opposition to Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east of the country.  The LNA has surrounded the city, on the coastal highway between Benghazi and Egypt, and has long threatened to begin ground operations there. However, its campaign has so far been limited to encirclement along with occasional air strikes and bombardments.  Derna is controlled by a coalition of Islamists and rebel veterans known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC). Egypt, which backs the LNA, has also carried out air strikes in Derna on what it said were training camps sending militants into Egypt.  Late on Sunday there were air strikes southeast of Derna, followed by clashes on Monday morning around a flour factory east of Derna. Three LNA troops were killed, a field hospital doctor said.  Last week the DMSC said two of its men had been killed in air strikes. The LNA lost four men in a landmine explosion.  In recent weeks the LNA has deployed new units in the Derna area and at the end of last month Haftar made a rare visit to forces stationed outside the city, following his return from medical treatment in France.  After Libya split between rival camps in the east and west of the country in 2014, Haftar gradually emerged as the dominant figure in the east. He is aligned with a parliament and government based in the east and opposes the internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli.  On Monday he was attending a military parade in Benghazi to mark the fourth anniversary of the start of his ""Dignity Operation"", the campaign in which the LNA battled Islamists and other rivals to take control of Benghazi last year.  The United Nations is leading efforts to stabilise Libya and prepare it for elections before the end of the year, but armed violence is still common across the country.  Another flashpoint is the southern city of Sabha, where fighting between communal groups that is linked to the wider conflict has escalated in recent weeks.  On Sunday, three children in Sabha were killed and five people including their parents were wounded by shelling, the manager of Sabha Medical Centre said.  Before that, at least 18 people had been killed and 86 wounded in fighting since February, he said.  (Writing by Aidan Lewis; editing by Andrew Roche and James Dalgleish)",en,terrorattack,,

According to SANA, ""anti-aircraft defences intercepted two Israeli missiles launched against (the district of) Kissweh and destroyed them"".  The agency had earlier reported ""explosions"" in the southern suburb, while state television broadcast images of fires in the area targeted by the strikes.  Mr Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP that the missiles had targeted a weapons depot in Kissweh, ""presumably belonging to Hizbollah and the Iranians"".  Mr Abdel Rahman said the strike had killed at least nine pro-government fighters, ""including members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and other pro-Iranian Shi'ite militiamen"", but it was not possible to independently confirm any toll.  Sanaa quoted a medical source saying that two civilians had died on a highway linking Damascus with the southern city of Deraa as a result of an explosion linked to ""the Israeli aggression"", without providing details.  This is not the first time that the area in the south-west of Damascus has been targeted. In December, Israel reportedly bombed military positions in Kissweh, including a weapons depot.  On Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ""fully supports"" the United States' withdrawal from a multinational nuclear deal with Iran.  His statement came as the Israeli-occupied section of the Golan Heights was placed on high alert due to ""irregular activity by Iranian forces"" across the demarcation line in Syria.  In recent years, particularly since 2017, Israel has carried out numerous strikes in Syria against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and his ally, the Lebanese Hizbollah militia.  On April 9, missiles targeted the T-4 air base in the central province of Homs, killing up to 14 fighters, including seven Iranians, two days after an alleged chemical attack carried out by the Syrian regime.  The air base was also targeted by Israel in February.  On April 29, at least 26 mostly Iranian fighters were killed by missiles fired on regime military positions, according to the Observatory.  The strikes, ""probably Israeli"", targeted a military airport in Aleppo in the country's north and Brigade 47 in Hama, where Iranian forces are stationed, the Observatory said.  Occasional clashes have erupted between Israel and the Syrian regime and its Hizbollah ally in the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967.  Israel is concerned that Iran and Hizbollah are embedding forces along its border.  In an interview late last month, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman vowed to strike at any attempt by Iran to establish a ""military foothold"" in Syria.",en,terrorattack,375,['Syria']

Defense officials said they will lay out how the mission unfolded, leading to the gruesome ambush, and then explain what is being done to correct the problems brought to light by the incident. Families of the fallen troops have been briefed on the investigation, including details of their loved ones' final moments as they battled as many as 100 insurgents in a fierce firefight.  ""The whole thing was a screwed-up mess,"" said Arnold Wright, father of Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright of Lyons, Georgia, who was killed in the attack. He said he's concerned that the Army may be pinning the blame on lower-ranking soldiers and not accepting responsibility high enough up the chain of command.  The briefing, he said, gave the impression ""that the captain, the team leader, that he mischaracterized the mission"" as one to reach out to local leaders rather than a mission to target the insurgent.  The Associated Press reported in early March that the team received information about the location of Doundou Chefou, who was suspected of involvement in the kidnapping an American aid worker, and acted on what they considered was a fleeting chance to get him. But the team did not disclose that mission to higher-level commanders, and instead outlined a lower-risk mission to meet with tribal leaders, U.S. officials told the AP. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation ahead of its release.  The report is expected to detail missteps in the mission's approval process and whether that contributed at all to the ambush that erupted many hours later. Its findings will put renewed focus on U.S. military activity in Africa, particularly the role of special operations forces who've been advising and working with local troops on the continent for years. Extremists linked to IS and al-Qaida carry out increasingly bold attacks in West Africa's vast Sahel region.  The investigation was led by U.S. Africa Command's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Roger Cloutier Jr. Officials spent months trying to unravel the complex incident, conducting dozens of interviews across the U.S., Europe and Africa.  The Pentagon will also unveil recommended changes, including greater oversight to ensure proper mission approval and risk assessment, as well as improved security measures, more heavily armored vehicles, and better weapons and training, U.S. officials said.  Killed in the attack were: Army Sgt. La David T. Johnson, 25, of Miami Gardens, Florida; Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Washington; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Georgia. Four Nigerien troops were killed and two American soldiers and eight Nigerien forces were wounded.  Officials have said the investigation doesn't draw a direct link between the team's failure to get appropriate approval of the initial kill or capture mission and the attack that came much later, once commanders had approved other changes to the mission. The team was called off before they got to the location where Chefou was believed to be, because he had left. The troops, however, were later sent to collect intelligence at a location where Chefou had been, and then they stopped at the village of Tongo Tongo for supplies before heading back to their base.  ""They had a mission to go to a location that was like four hours away and they went on that mission and the target was gone,"" Wright told the AP in an interview, recounting what Cloutier told him. ""They started back and they got like two hours or so from their home base and they got a change of mission to go to another location back north like four hours away to act as a blocking force for another team was coming in with helicopters to hit the target.""  Bad weather forced the helicopters to abort, Wright said, and his son's team went on to the site, where they destroyed motorcycles, ammunition and other equipment before heading to Tongo Tongo.  After leaving the village, they were ambushed about 120 miles (200 kilometers) north of Niamey, Niger's capital, by as many as 100 Islamic State-linked militants carrying small arms and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.  Wright, an Army veteran, said he was told the troops tried to stand and fight, leaving their vehicles so they could use them for cover. But as fighting intensified and more enemy fighters came, the American-led team decided to flee, using smoke for cover.  The two U.S. trucks with machine guns went first, Wright said, leaving behind the truck his son Dustin was driving that had no mounted gun. As his son tried to get away, Wright said Staff Sgt. Black was firing from the front passenger seat and Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson was shooting from the back of the truck. Then Black got shot.  ""So Dustin stops the vehicle, runs around and grabs Bryan Black by collar and pulls him behind the vehicle,"" Wright said.  As Johnson tried to help Black, Dustin Wright fired across the hood of the truck. Wright said Black died and the vehicle was disabled, so his son and Johnson fled on foot. Johnson was shot and Dustin Wright got hit after running back to help Johnson. Both died.  La David Johnson became separated from the others as he fought and ran for cover in the brush. He was gunned down, but his body wasn't found until two days later.  The battle, said Arnold Wright, lasted 40 minutes or more.  ___  Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.",en,terrorattack,,
1608858,bbci,Defence Diplomatic Correspondent Jonathan Marcus,Your questions answered on Iran and Israel relations,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44069932,,11/5/2018 5:43,"Image copyright AFP  Tensions continue to rise in the Middle East, after Israel launched missile attacks on Iranian targets in Syria, in response to rockets fired at its positions in the occupied Golan Heights on Wednesday night.  There has been international condemnation of the attacks, with the United States accusing Iran of trying to provoke a wider Middle East conflict.  So what could happen next in the region, and why are the countries in conflict? The BBC's defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus has answered some of your questions:  Why is there conflict between Israel and Iran?  There is little doubting Iran's fundamental antipathy towards Israel or its desire for the removal of the Jewish State. It has long supported radical groups opposed to Israel but now, because of its involvement in the war in Syria, it finds itself potentially on Israel's northern border.  Syrian President Assad's victory is now Iran's regional opportunity.  Iran's regional influence is growing. It is eager to establish itself as a military player in Syria. This - separately from its nuclear programme - is something that Israel sees as a fundamental threat.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus  Will Israel strike Tehran if Iran gets closer to developing weapons of mass destruction?  The nuclear dimension is now rearing its head again. Remember before the nuclear agreement with Iran - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA - that Mr Trump just abandoned, Israel and Iran were potentially heading for conflict, with fears that Israel (and/or the US) would strike at Iran's nuclear facilities.  What is the international community doing to prevent an escalation?  While everyone is worried and urging caution, outside actors can only impact events in a limited fashion. Israel and Iran are on a strategic collision course. Russia - also a player in Syria - has largely turned a blind eye to Israel's use of Syrian air space. It does not see its own and Iran's regional interests as necessarily intertwined.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump met in Washington in March 2018  The US has a diminishing diplomatic influence in the region and President Trump is likely to be a strong advocate of Israel's muscular stance.  Is Israel doing all the provoking?  I don't know. It is certainly sending a very strong message to Tehran to think again. Iran sees Israel's actions in Syria as provocative. Israel is opposed to Iran's growing military role on its border.  Who would the UK - not the UN or Nato - back in a conflict between Israel and Iran?  I'm not sure about active ""backing"". Britain is certainly unhappy about Iran's wider regional role and concerned about its nuclear ambitions. Unlike the US, it wants to stick with the nuclear deal. I think all major governments and international institutions will want to avoid a major regional conflagration between Israel and Iran.  In the UK's first formal response to Wednesday night's attacks, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""The United Kingdom condemns in the strongest terms the Iranian rocket attacks against Israeli forces. We strongly support Israel's right to defend itself.""  And he urged Iran to ""refrain from further actions which will only lead to increased instability in the region.""  What event on either side would characterise an ""escalation""? Is there a defined red line for Israel and Iran, and if so, where?  Israel's red lines up to now have been related to the transfer of advanced weaponry by Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has attacked arms convoys and weapons dumps. It is concerned about more accurate long-range missiles, sophisticated anti-ship and anti-armour weapons reaching the Shia militia.  Now, though, things have moved on - Iranian forces are now establishing themselves in Syria - and by the scale and scope of its strikes on Wednesday night, Israel is saying that enough is enough. Effectively, these Iranian forces are a long way from home and should go back to Tehran!  Israeli military spokesmen insist that all the 70 or so targets they hit on Wednesday night were core Iranian Revolutionary Guard installations - not pro-Iran militias or proxy forces.  Are there talks between Israel and Iran on any level?  I would be surprised if there were any direct contacts at all. Others may act as intermediaries - Russia for example - but the ""message"" from Israel to Iran has clearly been delivered in a more direct way.  In the days of the Shah, Israel was a close ally of Iran. Relations were broken off after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, though it is thought that for a period Israel continued to supply arms to Iran which was then waging a bitter struggle with Iraq. Ultimately, relations went into the freezer.  Iranian rhetoric and policy is strongly anti-Israel. Iran has given strong military support, not only to its Shia allies like Hezbollah in Lebanon, but is widely thought to have helped sponsor terrorism against Israeli or Jewish targets abroad - something of course that Iran has always denied.

The attack on the mosque on Thursday in Verulam, a town 27km north of Durban, left the Muslim community outraged and demanding answers.  Major Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal province's acting police commissioner, said in a statement the motive was still unclear. The assailants also set the mosque on fire before escaping in a getaway vehicle.  ""Such criminality cannot be tolerated. A team of investigators has been dispatched to solve the case and bring perpetrators to book,"" Langa said.  Emergency rescue services said the imam's throat had been slit and he later died, while the two other men had been stabbed. Both victims were in hospital in critical condition.  Swift condemnation  The incident drew immediate condemnation from the Muslim leadership across the country.  Faisal Suleman, chairperson of the South African Muslim Network, told Al Jazeera his organisation would not want to speculate on a motive given it was still not clear.  ""We condemn this attack and we are urging the law enforcement to spare no effort in apprehending the perpetrators alive so that the reasons become known,"" Suleman said from Durban.  ""South Africa has not had such attacks in the past, so we caution against speculation.""  The Muslim Judicial Council denounced the bloodshed and said the core of Islamic teachings and principles are ""respect for all human beings"".  Islamic scholar Shaykh Rafeek Haseen told community radio station Voice of the Cape that Durban's Muslim community is in shock and urged people not to jump to conclusions.  ""It may be a case of money laundering or a personal issue between the perpetrators and the victims. I do not think we should jump to conclusions that this attack is motivated by sectarianism,"" said Haseen.  The United Ulama Council of South Africa denounced ""these grievous and vicious attacks"".  ""We condemn these unjustifiable acts of violence, which foster nothing but tension, mistrust, and insecurity within communities,"" said the group's Secretary General Yusuf Patel.  Extremely rare  Muslims make up about 1.9 percent of South Africa's 55 million population, with most following the Sunni Muslim denomination. Attacks on mosques are extremely rare, but observers note anti-Shia rhetoric has been on the rise over the past few years, especially on social media.  Farid Sayed, editor of the Muslim Views newspaper based in Cape Town, said there have been attacks on mosques before, but usually from the ""racist, white right-wing"".  Sayed said many Muslims in South Africa deny the fact that there is intra-faith intolerance in the community.  ""One can dismiss this as a once-off attack, it may not even be a sectarian attack. But I think it alerts us to the fact that we could actually be facing a situation where there could be violence [in the future].  ""In the past, it was always verbal attacks, not physical. I have some [social media] posts that suggest that it 'was just a Shia mosque', in other words, they deserved to be attacked,"" Sayed said.  The country's parliament also released a statement condemning the violence.  ""A mosque is a religious institution and South Africa's constitution guarantees and protects the right to religious practices,"" Francois Beukman, chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, said in a statement released from parliament.  ""This kind of attack on three innocent people is totally unjustified. We want our communities to live in harmony, practicing their religions without fear.""

One of the injured was a Chinese citizen, Chinese media have reported.  Mr Collomb said none had life-threatening injuries.  How did the events unfold?  The attacker began stabbing passers-by at about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT).  Eyewitnesses described him as a young man with brown hair and a beard, dressed in black tracksuit trousers.  He shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack, witnesses said.  The man tried to enter several bars and restaurants but was blocked by people inside.  Police first tried to stop the assailant with a Taser before shooting him dead, nine minutes after he began the attack.  Jonathan, a waiter at a local restaurant, told AFP: ""I saw him with a knife in his hand. He looked crazy.""  He said a woman, stabbed by the attacker, had run into into the restaurant bleeding. The assailant tried to follow her inside but was fended off and finally fled.  Two of the wounded in the attack are in a serious condition but do not have life-threatening injuries.  IS said it was behind the attack in a brief statement posted on its news outlet.  How are IS and Chechnya linked?  Chechnya is a republic in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia.  The republic declared independence in 1991 but three years later Russian troops were sent in to quash the movement, sparking a decade-long conflict.  Jihadist groups, including those aligned with IS, have long operated in the region.  The brothers behind the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had Chechen links and Turkish authorities said a Chechen jihadist was the suspected organiser of an attack on Istanbul airport in 2016 that killed 45 people.  The jihadist, Akhmed Chatayev, a member of IS, was killed in a clash with special forces in the Georgian capital Tbilisi in 2017.  IS has actively recruited fighters in Chechnya, sending hundreds to conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.  A report from the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in 2016 spoke of the fear that the fighters would return to carry out terrorist attacks at home.

Firefighters try to extinguish a blaze following a blast at the Pentecost Church Central Surabaya (GPPS), in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia May 13, 2018, in this photo provided by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/ Handout Surabaya Government/ via REUTERS  Indonesia, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest Muslim-majority country, has seen a recent resurgence in homegrown militancy and police said the family who carried out SundayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attacks were among 500 Islamic State sympathizers who had returned from Syria.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The husband drove the car, an Avanza, that contained explosives and rammed it into the gate in front of that church,Ã¢â‚¬Â East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera told reporters at the regional police headquarters in Surabaya.  The wife and two daughters were involved in an attack on a second church and at the third church Ã¢â‚¬Å“two other children rode the motorbike and had the bomb across their lapsÃ¢â‚¬Â, Mangera said.  The two daughters were aged 12 and 9 while the other two, thought to be the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sons, were 18 and 16, police said.  Police blamed the bombings on the Islamic State-inspired group Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD).  JAD is an umbrella organisation on a U.S. State Department terrorist list that is estimated to have drawn hundreds of Islamic State sympathizers in Indonesia.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, in a message carried on its Amaq news agency.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This act is barbaric and beyond the limits of humanity, causing victims among members of society, the police and even innocent children,Ã¢â‚¬Â President Joko Widodo said during a visit to the scene of the attacks.  Indonesian terrorism analyst Rakyan Adibrata said it was the first time children had been involved in attacks in the country.  East Java police spokesman Mangera said at least 13 people had been killed and 40 had been taken to hospital, including two police officers. He called on people to remain calm.  Streets around the bombed churches were blocked by checkpoints and heavily armed police stood guard as forensic and bomb squad officers combed the area for clues.  Police stand guard near the site of a blast at the Pentecost Church Central Surabaya (GPPS), in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia May 13, 2018 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Moch Asim / via REUTERS  Television footage showed one church where the yard in front was engulfed in fire with thick, black smoke billowing up. A large blast was heard hours after the attacks, which Mangera said was a bomb disposal squad dealing with a device.  JAIL STANDOFF  The attacks are the deadliest in Indonesia linked to Islamic State and the worst since October 2005, when three suicide bombers blew themselves up in Bali restaurants killing 20.  They came days after militant Islamist prisoners killed five members of an elite counter-terrorism force during a 36-hour standoff at a high-security jail near Jakarta.  Police Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters that because many militant leaders had been captured Ã¢â‚¬Å“these groups are starting to ... retaliate.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Wawan Purwanto, communication director at IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intelligence agency, said the main target of militants remained the security forces, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“there are alternative (targets) if the main targets are blockedÃ¢â‚¬Â.  At St MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catholic church, the first place of worship to be attacked, the bombing happened after an earlier mass was over and when the church was getting ready to hold another service.  Slideshow (9 Images)  Separately, an internal police report reviewed by Reuters said a suspected bomb exploded in a car in the parking lot of a Pentacostal church, setting alight dozens of motorbikes.  In the third location, the Indonesian Christian Church, veiled women entered the churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yard where they were stopped by a security guard before an explosion occurred at the same spot, according to the police report.  POPE OFFERS PRAYERS  Jeirry Sumampow, a spokesman for IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s church association (PGI), called on the government for more help for security at churches.  Pope Francis offered his prayers for the victims.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am particularly close to the dear people of Indonesia, especially to the communities of Christians of the city of Surabaya, which were hit hard by the serious attack on places of worship,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said during his Sunday prayer in Rome.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Together we invoke the God of peace (asking him) to cease these violent actions and (to make sure) that in the heart of all there could be a space not feelings of hatred and violence, but of reconciliation and fraternity.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Nearly 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but the country is also home to sizeable communities of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and people who adhere to traditional beliefs.  Indonesia has had some major successes tackling militancy inspired by al QaedaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attacks on the United States in 2001. But there has been a resurgence of Islamist attacks in recent years, including in January 2016 when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in central Jakarta.  Churches have also been targeted previously, including near-simultaneous attacks over Christmas in 2000 that killed about 20 people.

Director General of MI5 Andrew Parker looks on, as he delivers a speech in central London, on the security threat facing Britain October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Stefan Rousseau/Pool - RC17A92C34E0  Britain, as EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preeminent intelligence power, is seeking a new security pact with the bloc to ensure it gets continued access to secrets from major EU countries as it seeks to clinch a broader Brexit deal.  In the first public speech outside Britain by a serving head of MI5, Andrew Parker will tell an event in Berlin hosted by GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BfV domestic intelligence service that Islamic State militants are plotting Ã¢â‚¬Å“devastating and more complex attacks.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“European intelligence cooperation today is simply unrecognisable to what it looked like five years ago,Ã¢â‚¬Â MI5 Director General Parker will say on Monday, according to excerpts of his speech made available to Reuters.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“In todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncertain world, we need that shared strength more than ever,Ã¢â‚¬Â Parker, who gives very few public speeches, will say.  Britain suffered four deadly militant attacks last year that killed 36 people, the deadliest spate since the London Ã¢â‚¬Å“7/7Ã¢â‚¬Â bombings of July 2005.  In March, a man killed five people after driving a into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London before stabbing a policeman to death outside parliament.  That was followed by a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester which killed 22, and the following month eight people died after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people at nearby restaurants and bars.  Two weeks later a van was driven into worshippers near a London mosque which left one man dead.  Speaking ahead of the May 22 anniversary of the Manchester bombing, Parker said that 12 plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack, bringing the total number of disrupted attacks since 2013 to 25.  He praised the Counter-Terrorism Group (CTG), which groups all 28 European Union countries, Switzerland and Norway, for its exchange of intelligence.  MI5, established in 1909 to counter German espionage ahead of World War One, is tasked with protecting British national security and so takes the lead, along with the police, in countering militant attacks.  Beside the threat from Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, Parker pointed to Russia as a hostile state which was trying to carry out Ã¢â‚¬Å“aggressive and pernicious actionsÃ¢â‚¬Â with its military and intelligence services.  Britain blames Russia for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MI6 foreign spy service, and his daughter Yulia who were both found unconscious on a bench in the cathedral city of Salisbury on March 4.  Britain said the Skripals were attacked with a military-grade nerve agent from the Novichok group of poisons, developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s.  Moscow denied any involvement in the first known use of an offensive nerve agent on European soil since World War Two, though the attack sparked the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War.  Parker accused the Kremlin of Ã¢â‚¬Å“flagrant breaches of international rulesÃ¢â‚¬Â and said the attack on the Skripals was an example of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s malign activities that risked turning the country into an Ã¢â‚¬Å“isolated pariahÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Russian officials suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.  Russia, he said, had sought to deploy an unprecedented level of disinformation following the attack.  The West, he said, should Ã¢â‚¬Å“shine a light through the fog of lies, half-truths and obfuscation that pours out of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s propaganda machine.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge.

Two brothers, a husband and her brother-in-law. They all fought for the Tamil Tigers. They all surrendered to the army. And they all disappeared.  Her hometown, Mullaitivu, is a city of the missing. Nestled on Sri Lanka's northeast tip, this town was the front line in some of the bloodiest final battles of a 26-year civil war between the armed group, the Tamil Tigers, and government forces.  Sasikumar and hundreds of other Tamil families claim they handed over their loved ones - former combatants - to the military on a causeway near Mullaitivu in May 2009, just after the war ended.  ""Many buses were lined up. Hundreds of them. I was seven months pregnant at the time. When I asked to go in the bus with my husband, the army commander refused,'' she says.  Sasikumar was forced onto another bus and ended up at a refugee camp with her parents. She believed that her relatives would also be processed and brought to the camp.  But almost a decade later, she is still waiting, along with other relatives of former combatants who were herded onto buses and never came back.  I'm slowly telling him that his father is lost. Missing. It makes me cry inside ... I don't know whether he is dead or alive. Sasikumar Ranginithevi  With most of the men of working age in her family gone, Sasikumar is struggling to survive as the sole breadwinner in her household.  ""We have no peace in our lives. I have two children, I have parents and an older brother who was wounded in the war. My youngest son is nine years old. He keeps asking me where his father is. I keep telling him his father is in detention. Now I'm slowly telling him that his father is lost. Missing. It makes me cry inside. What can I tell my son? I don't know whether he's dead or alive,"" she says.  'The army officer took the child from my arms'  Former fighters are not the only ones who disappeared in the chaos of the conflict. Children and civilians are also among the missing.  Sivakanthan Manchula's eight-year-old son was wounded by a mortar shell in the final days of the war. Soldiers took him by helicopter to a hospital in another city for treatment.  ""The army officer took the child from my arms,"" she recalls. ""They said they would bring him back when he was cured. They kept repeating that to us, even when they locked us up in the camp. He was only eight. If he died of the wound, I would have been able to accept the fact that he is no more.""  Like many whose loved ones went missing during the war, she reported her son's disappearance to the United Nations and the Red Cross. But she admits she has very little evidence to prove what happened.  ""How do they expect us to remember the faces of officers responsible? We were facing shelling, we had no food and water Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ we had to follow the soldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions like cows.""  Denial: 'An exaggerated story'  At the time of these disappearances, former General Sarath Fonseka was Sri Lanka's army chief. He says that all 215,000 Tamils who surrendered during the war were properly processed in the presence of international observers.  ""During the last two weeks of the war, we had a good system where we had beautiful arrangements. I am 100 percent sure incidents of this nature never took place. People being taken in busloads and never returning - that is definitely an exaggerated story,"" he says.    Many Tamil families of the missing refute these denials.  For the past year they have held daily vigils in Mullaitivu and four other towns across Sri Lanka. In the tents where they sit in the wind and the dust, photos of missing loved ones hang on the walls.  They're furious with the authorities. When the government was elected in 2015, leaders promised to release the names of people held in custody, but have since refused to do so.  Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has also been criticised for being slow to set up an Office of Missing Persons to trace the 60,000 Sri Lankans who disappeared in the last three decades. It took three years of deliberations before seven commissioners were appointed.  Lead commissioner, Saliya Pieris, a well-known human rights lawyer, says the Office of Missing Persons will have forensic experts, witness protection divisions and investigative powers. But he admits it will not have the power to prosecute guilty parties. The office can only refer suspects to the lawyer.  ""I think the scepticism is natural,"" Pieris says. ""The only way we can get rid of this is through actions and by establishing a credible mechanism. If we promise people results overnight and the results are not forthcoming, people will lose faith. But we have to be objective, independent and impartial.""  No public trust in the Office of Missing Persons  Critics remain doubtful that the new agency will help trace the missing. This is the 10th commission set up to investigate disappearances. None of the past efforts solved a single case.  {articleGUID}  In this divided country, the Office of Missing Persons has attracted criticism from various parties because the commissioners include a former army general, a family member of a disappeared person and human rights activists.  Dharsha Jegatheeswaran, a lawyer who works with families of the disappeared, says there isn't a lot of public trust in the office.  ""I think one of the reasons is that families weren't consulted in the process,"" says Jegatheeswaran, from the Adayaalam Centre for Policy Research.  ""I think having a military representative was a huge blow to the families' confidence ... When military were often the perpetrators in disappearances that happened during the armed conflict, how can they feel confident going before somebody who is a military official and was part of the military during this period of the conflict?""  The military is also unhappy with the makeup of the commission.  While President Sirisena has said that war heroes would not be subject to scrutiny by the agency, Major General Uday Perera says many senior army officers are still not prepared to testify.  ""When you have people who have been critical of the army as commissioners, I don't think personally I would not like to go there and get humiliated. So it's a matter of having credible, neutral people in the commission, rather than having activists and people who have been working for NGOs,"" Perera says.  I think having a military representative was a huge blow to the families' confidence ... When military were often the perpetrators in disappearances that happened during the armed conflict, how can they feel confident going before somebody who is a military official and was part of the military during this period of the conflict? Dharsha Jegatheeswaran, lawyer  Using abduction to silence government critics  Sri Lanka's security forces aren't only accused of wartime mass disappearances. They've been accused of abducting government critics to silence dissent. Trade unionists, journalists and human rights campaigners say they were targeted during and after the civil war.  Major General Perera, who was a chief of operations in northern Sri Lanka, denies the security forces have ever been involved in enforced disappearances,  ""This is not a banana state,"" he says. ""If someone thinks that Sri Lanka can hide and keep a person in today's context, I think he should go and see a psychiatrist.""  {articleGUID}  But his former boss, General Sarath Fonseka disagrees. Now a minister in Sri Lanka's government, he says he is prepared to testify at the Missing Person's Office that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's administration used abductions to silence their critics.  He alleges that former Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former president's brother, was the mastermind behind these abductions.  ""I have very good tight control of the military. But there are other people like some in the police, some in intelligence agencies who prefer to please this man and join hands with him. Abductions were taking place Whoever did that, they did not do it during the process of their legitimate duties, outside the duties.""  In a statement, Gotabaya Rajapaksa denied these allegations.  ""I very confidently take this opportunity to place on record that, during the war on terrorism mentioned, [the] government of Sri Lanka did not engage in any acts of alleged enforced disappearances and abductions as claimed by various scurrilous elements with vested political interest,"" Rajapaksa said in a statement to Al Jazeera.  This is not a banana state ... If someone thinks that Sri Lanka can hide and keep a person in today's context, I think he should go and see a psychiatrist. Uday Perera, Major General  Systematic and widespread torture to instill fear  Earlier this year, Sri Lanka passed a law criminalising abductions. General Sarath Fonseka says abductions or enforced disappearances are a thing of the past.  But the International Truth and Justice Project, an advocacy group administered by the Foundation for Human Rights, has gathered testimony from more than 80 Tamil asylum seekers across Europe. The men allege that they were abducted, tortured and raped in the past two years.  It's a claim backed up by London-based refugee lawyer, Kulasegaram Geetharhanan. He represents more than 100 clients who are claiming asylum in the UK because they fear their lives are in danger under Sri Lanka's current regime. Geetharhanan says four of his clients claim they were tortured earlier this year.  ""The torture is systematic and widespread. The purpose we can see is to instill fear in the Tamils, not to revolt again and at the same time, not to give evidence against the war crimes in 2009,"" Geetharhanan says.  I think I could be abducted again if I went back ... I will commit suicide if I'm forced back to Sri Lanka. Milton Thusanathan  Many of the men had relatives who fought for the Tamil Tigers. Milton Thusanathan, 20, alleges he was abducted and tortured in Mullaitivu by the security forces in 2016 and then again in 2017.  ""I think I could be abducted again if I went back ... I will commit suicide if I'm forced back to Sri Lanka,"" he said.",en,terrorattack,,

National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian has said the terrorists behind a series of suicide bomb attacks at three churches in Surabaya, East Java, on Sunday, used an explosive type called triacetone triperoxide (TATP). This type of explosive is commonly used by Islamic State (IS) militants when carrying out terror attacks.  TATP, sometimes referred to as ""Mother of Satan"", is made from materials that are widely available on the market, Tito said.  ""All of those materials are very dangerous since they can easily trigger an explosion at random because of their sensitivity,"" he told journalists in a press conference Surabaya on Monday.

Several major bombing incidents causing multiple fatalities, such as the 2005 London bombings, the 2015 Paris bombing, the 2016 Brussels airport bombing, as well as last year's bombing of the Manchester Arena, used TATP.  Before Sunday's Surabaya church bombings, this type of explosive was first reportedly used by Leopard Wisnu Kumala, a 29-year-old man who attempted to extort money from Alam Sutra Mall management by threatening to explode several bombs in the mall in October 2015.",en,terrorattack,,

""  The first time King had gonorrhea, he was a teenager in the late 1970s, growing up in Louisiana.  King visited a clinic and gave a fake name and phone number. He was treated quickly with antibiotics and sent on his way.  A few years later, the symptoms reappeared. By this time, the 22-year-old was living in West Hollywood, hoping to launch his acting career.  Los Angeles had a thriving a gay scene where King, for the first time, could embrace his sexuality freely. He frequented bathhouses and also met men in dance clubs and along the bustling sidewalks. There was lots of sex to be had.  Like a few years earlier, the doctor gave him a handful of antibiotics to take for a few days that would clear up the infection. It wasn't a big deal. In fact, as King describes it, it was ""simply an errand to run.""  But it was the calm before the storm, in more ways than one.  When King picked up gonorrhea again in the 1990s, he was greatly relieved that treatment was now just one dose.  Penicillin was no longer effective, but ciprofloxacin was now the recommended treatment and it required only one dose. In King's eyes, getting gonorrhea was even less of a hassle.  But this was actually a symptom of treatment regimens starting to fail.  The bacteria Neisseria gonorrheae was on the way to developing resistance to nearly every drug ever used to treat it.  A global threat  When Alexander Fleming received the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering penicillin, he finished his lecture with a warning: ""There is the danger,"" he told the audience, ""that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and, by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug, make them resistant.""  In other words, we have known about bacteria's ability to evolve resistance to drugs since the dawn of the antibiotic era.  ""All antibiotics will have a shelf life; that's just evolution,"" says Dr. Manica Balasegaram. ""It's just a question of how quickly it will happen.""  Balasegaram is director of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, based in Geneva. It's a joint initiative between the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative and the World Health Organization and aims to develop new or improved treatments for bacterial infections.  Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development. Common infections, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, are becoming increasingly difficult to treat.  But the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership has chosen to focus its attention on gonorrhea as one of its four main priorities.  The sexually transmitted infection, or STI, caught Balasegaram's eyes for a host of reasons.  Acquiring resistance quickly  For one, a lot of the antibiotics that are currently used against gonorrhea are used widely for other infections, and N. gonorrheae has the ability to acquire resistance from other bacteria frighteningly quickly, meaning it can rapidly build up resistance.  Secondly, untreated gonorrhea infections bring with them a range of potentially serious health implications that can have devastating consequences.  Every year an estimated 78 million people are infected with gonorrhea, making it the second most frequently reported bacterial STI after chlamydia, according to the WHO.  Gonorrhea can infect the genitals, rectum and throat. Symptoms include discharge from the urethra or vagina and burning during urination called urethritis, caused by inflammation of the urethra. However, many who are infected don't experience any symptoms, meaning they go undiagnosed and untreated.  Complications of untreated gonorrhea can be severe and disproportionately affect women, who are more likely to experience no symptoms.  Untreated gonorrhea not only increases the risk of contracting HIV but is also linked with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause ectopic pregnancy and infertility. A pregnant woman can also pass on the infection to her baby, which can cause blindness.  A major concern is that because N. gonorrheae can live in the throat without someone even knowing, the bug can acquire resistance from other bacteria that also live there and which have been exposed to antibiotics in the past. And with evidence that oral sex is becoming increasingly common in some parts of the world, this is particularly challenging.  ""People are dying from drug-resistant infections. This is undoubtedly because this area has not been prioritized in the past because other areas of R&D are far more lucrative,"" Balasegaram says.  ""Antibiotics are a global public good. I don't think it's easy to put a financial value to it.""  Photos: Disease vs. drugs: How microbes are winning the war Experts warn that a global health crisis is on the horizon as drugs available for once treatable diseases are losing their edge. The bacteria, viruses and parasites behind diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and gonorrhea are fighting back by developing resistance to our arsenal of pharmaceuticals.    With the World Health Organization saying that we could be heading to a ""post-antibiotic age,"" what infections are becoming a concern?

However, resistance to the drug developed and spread rapidly across the world rendering the drug, and hope of eradication, useless by the 1970s.    A new wave of excitement came soon after with the arrival of artemisinin, which is today prescribed as a combination therapy to avoid the development of resistance. Despite this strategy, resistance has been reported in Cambodia and could once again spread globally. Globalization and increasing travel to remote locations means the 200 million cases of malaria estimated to occur each year are not just a concern for developing countries.

But the virus reproduces rapidly, meaning resistant forms could easily form and multiply. Up to 14% resistance was found in high-income countries soon after antiretrovirals were introduced in the 1990s and increased use of treatment in developing countries has seen resistance emerge more globally. In 2012, 35 million people were estimated to be living with HIV, based on World Health Organization reports, and with over 2 million people newly infected in 2012, HIV could one day return to pandemic levels if resistance continues to spread.

With few new drugs in the pipeline to control the bacteria, total resistance could spread.

The United States sees over 5,000 people infected each year after consuming contaminated food and drink abroad.    The bacterium behind the disease, Salmonella typhi, can be killed with various antibiotics, but resistance is now arising to multiple antibiotics and complicating treatment, especially in South Asia, a popular holiday destination. Hide Caption 5 of 8 Photos: Disease vs. drugs: How microbes are winning the war Hospital acquired Infections (insert: Klebsiella)    Multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which causes a range of symptoms from boils and abscesses to blood poisoning and arthritis, has been a concern for years in hospitals and whilst public health teams have been tackling it, a group of bugs known as the ESKAPE pathogens is taking the lead.    Standing for Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter, the ESKAPE pathogens cause a range of symptoms including pneumonia, urinary-tract infections, septicemia, meningitis and diarrhea. If resistance continues to rise, WHO reports highlight that a routine hospital visit could result in a more serious condition. Hide Caption 6 of 8 Photos: Disease vs. drugs: How microbes are winning the war Gonorrhea (insert: Neisseria Gonorrhoea)    Globally, there are an estimated 88 million cases of this sexually transmitted infection, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, each year. Resistance to antibiotics began to occur soon after their introduction in the 1930s and has continued to rise with resistance now seen against five of the drugs once used to treat it -- which include the commonly used antibiotics penicillin and tetracycline.    Only one class of drug, cephalosporins, remains with the ability to fight the bacteria, but resistance to this last resort has now occurred in 10 countries. If this spreads globally, gonorrhea could become untreatable and spread rapidly throughout a promiscuous population. Hide Caption 7 of 8 Photos: Disease vs. drugs: How microbes are winning the war Influenza (insert: influenza virus)  Influenza virus types A and B sweep through countries annually in the winter months; they cause fever, headaches and muscular pain in most cases, but also cause 3 million to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year, according to the WHO The antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir are the main means of fighting infection. Preventative antivirals amantadine and rimantadine were once used to control seasonal spread, but high levels of resistance means their use is no longer recommended.    The constantly evolving biology of the influenza virus means that resistance can easily form. Amantadine-resistant viruses began emerging in 2003 and oseltamivir-resistant viruses since 2007. Resistance to zanamivir has also been reported. While the majority of viruses found globally are still sensitive to the key drugs, the resistant forms could easily spread as no other drug options remain available. Hide Caption 8 of 8  Seeing half the picture  Recent data collected by WHO examined trends in drug-resistant gonorrhea in 77 countries -- countries that are part of the health agency's Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme, a global network of regional and subregional laboratories that track the emergence and spread of resistance.  And the results are grim.  More than 80 per cent of the countries that reported on azithromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic used to treat numerous common infections, including STIs, found resistance.  Of greatest concern is that 66 per cent of countries surveyed have reported cases that resist last-resort antibiotics called extended-spectrum cephalosporins.  Dr Teodora Wi, a medical officer in WHO's Department of Reproductive Health and Research in Geneva, says that the real-world picture is undoubtedly far bleaker, because global surveillance for drug-resistant gonorrhea is patchy and more frequently done in higher-income countries, which have greater resources.  For example, of the 77 countries that were surveyed, few were in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where rates of gonorrhea are high.  ""We're only seeing half of the real picture. We need to prepare for the future when there's no cure,"" Wi says.  But in a sign that time is running out, in March this year health experts' worst fears were confirmed: a case of super-gonorrhea, dubbed the world's ""worst ever"" case, was found in a man who had attended a local sexual health clinic.  He had reportedly had sexual contact with a woman in Southeast Asia.  Health officials said it was the first time this strain could not be cured with any of the antibiotics normally used to treat the disease. Although the patient has since responded to another antibiotic, doctors described him as ""very lucky"". It's an indication of a wider crisis -- and one that knows no boundaries.  The Thai front line  Thailand is one country on the front line of the fight against antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. It's a key destination for the sex tourism industry, where STIs like gonorrhea can spread easily and quickly across borders and beyond.  And like many other countries in the region, it has an over-the-counter culture of antibiotic access, which means patients put themselves at risk of being prescribed the wrong drugs -- or even worse.  But while experts acknowledge that restricting the sale of antibiotics -- particularly in rural and remote areas where there are few, if any, proper doctors -- isn't the answer, this still presents a major challenge in the fight against drug-resistant infections.  ""The problem is that when you go to a pharmacist and take antibiotics, maybe... your symptoms have disappeared, but in fact you still have the infection. That means you can transmit the infection and cause more resistance,"" Wi says.  The casual handing out of antibiotics without a prescription is a huge concern across the rest of the region and in other parts of the world, with no clear vision of how to tackle this growing problem.  Handing out antibiotics that likely no longer work for people with gonorrhea has also been happening in high-income countries.  A study published in the BMJ in 2015 found that many GPs in England were prescribing ciprofloxacin, even though it hasn't been recommended for treating gonorrhea since 2005. In 2007, ciprofloxacin still made up almost half of prescriptions for gonorrhea. As recently as 2011, GPs still prescribed it in 20 percent of cases.  Moving people  On a balmy afternoon in bustling Bangkok, I visit Silom Community Clinic @ TropMed, an STI clinic northeast of the city center dedicated to men who have sex with men (called MSM) and transgender women who have sex with men.  Dr Eileen Dunne is an American epidemiologist and the head of the behavioral and clinical research section of the HIV/STI program here, which is run as part of a collaboration between Thailand's Ministry of Public Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She, along with her Thai staff, are Thailand's best line of defense in slowing gonorrhea resistance.  In 2015, recognizing the worldwide danger of increasingly difficult to treat gonorrhea infections -- and the specific threat they posed to Thailand -- the CDC, the WHO and the Thai Ministry of Public Health joined forces to launch a program to track and ultimately limit the spread of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea.  The program is an enhanced local version of the WHO's Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme and is the first of its kind in the world. It's called EGASP.  It works like this. If a male patient comes into one of its two clinics with the telltale symptoms of gonorrhea, he will have a sample collected for analysis and will fill out a questionnaire, which contains questions such as: ""Did you take antibiotics in the last two weeks?"" To create an open environment, the clinics are anonymous and the questionnaire is done privately on a computer.  Men are the target group in the program, Dunne explains, because the yield for isolating N. gonorrheae is very high among men who have urethritis compared with women and those who are asymptomatic. MSM are an important population, she adds, because research shows they are likelier to develop resistance earlier than the general population, for reasons that aren't precisely known.  Samples are cultured from the swabs taken from the patients' penises. The next step is antibiotic susceptibility testing at a lab downstairs. The bacteria that have grown will be measured for resistance to five antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and the last-resort drugs cefixime and ceftriaxone. It's resistance to these latter two which is of greatest concern.  From the beginning of EGASP until October 20, of the 845 confirmed diagnoses of gonorrhea that underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing, almost all isolates had widespread resistance to ciprofloxacin, as in many other countries.  But encouragingly, none have shown resistance to the last-line drugs.  ""People are surprised and have asked, 'Oh, why are you doing this if you don't show resistance?' "" Dunne says.  But having strong surveillance activity in a region in which this is likely to emerge is important, she says, so it can be detected early.  Thailand's neighbors, specifically Myanmar, India, Indonesia and China, have recorded a significantly higher percentage of gonorrhea isolates that are resistant to last-line treatments compared to Thailand.  With the increasing movement of people around the world and Thailand's popularity for sex tourism, I can see just how rapidly this threat could have far-reaching consequences.  Last resorts  The number of people infected with gonorrhea has risen rapidly in recent years. In England, gonorrhea cases rose by 53 per cent between 2012 and 2015, led by young people, gay men and other MSM. Meanwhile, in the USA cases rose by nearly 50 per cent between 2009 and 2016.  Looking ahead, at what point will it be more common to have a gonorrhea infection that can't be treated with antibiotics than one that can? The answer is difficult to predict, but it's also a potential reality that isn't farfetched.  ""We are in a situation now where we are worryingly using the last line of antibiotics for many infections or seeing even resistance to these last-line antibiotics,"" Balasegaram says.  The Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership has partnered with Entasis Therapeutics, a US biotech company, to accelerate the development of a new antibiotic that will be produced specifically to target drug-resistant gonorrhea.  Zoliflodacin is a novel first-in-class oral antibiotic -- in other words, a new and unique mechanism of potentially treating gonorrhea -- and is one of only three potential new antibiotic candidates currently undergoing trials. It had previously been put through clinical trials in 2015, but a lack of investment stopped the drug from progressing further.  This year the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership and Entasis will launch the last phase of trials of zoliflodacin, involving 650 people in Thailand, South Africa, the USA and parts of Europe.  If the drug is approved by regulators, Entasis will permit the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership to introduce it in 168 low- and middle-income countries. It's hoping it will be registered by 2021 and available on the market by 2023.  ""We still don't know whether this project will succeed or not,"" says Balasegaram. ""But it's a project that we feel is extremely important and that we're very committed to.""  The development of new antibiotics raises myriad questions: How can we ensure they are used appropriately so we can preserve their effectiveness? And how can we ensure those who really need the drugs get them?  One way would be a point-of-care rapid diagnostic test -- ideally one that could predict which antibiotics will work on a particular infection and that could be used in settings around the world.  Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.  Balasegaram says they've been looking for a simple diagnostic tool like this but haven't yet found one. Diagnostic tools aside, the responsible use of new antibiotics also relies on robust national and international treatment guidelines and strong regulatory authorities to guide and monitor antibiotic use.  A major strength of the partnership between the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership and Entasis is that it will be able to limit what infections zoliflodacin is used for. ""If you have developed an antibiotic for narrow use, you have to think about how to market the drug. We do not want to drop large quantities of it around the world. But we also want to make sure those who need it get it,"" he says.  This is where strong surveillance programs, like Thailand's, are critical.  But it's inevitable that bugs will develop resistance to the next antibiotic and then the next. So Balasegaram wants more investment in R&D that focuses not only on new antibiotics but also on alternative ways to treat bacterial infections.  ""This may include novel and non-conventional approaches,"" he says. ""I think that is a job that is going to last decades.""",en,diseas,,

Dozens of funerals took place across Gaza after 60 Palestinians were killed in demonstrations, according to figures provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health.  Among the dead were eight children, including eight-month-old Laila Anwar Ghandour. The health ministry said the baby was asphyxiated by tear gas.  Ghandour's funeral was held on Tuesday morning. Her mother and father cradled her body, wrapped in a white funeral shroud, before her father walked to the graveyard to bury her. Relatives said Laila was sitting in her mother's lap when the infant inhaled the tear gas.  ""They were sitting on the side. (Israeli troops) fired tear gas haphazardly. The baby girl couldn't take it and she died,"" said the girl's father, Anwar Ghandour.  ""We're nearly done with our lives, but these poor kids have their whole lives ahead of them. What have they done wrong?"" said Um Khalid al Ashram, a middle-aged Palestinian woman who was near the funeral procession.  The Palestinian Ministry of Health said Monday was the deadliest day in Gaza since the 2014 war. In the West Bank, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has called for three days of mourning, saying Monday's events were ""one of the most ferocious days our people have seen.""  Shops in Gaza were closed and people could be heard talking about the dead. Images of the dead and short eulogies flooded Palestinian social media. CNN journalists on the ground said it appeared that nearly every neighborhood in Gaza had lost someone in Monday's demonstrations.  Tuesday's funerals came on a day Palestinians call ""The Catastrophe"" or ""Nakba,"" in memory of the more than 700,000 Palestinians who were driven from or left their homes during the 1948-1949 Arab-Israeli war.  Israel's military says protesters were trying to storm the border fence between Israel and Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday's confrontations were ""the determined action of the IDF and the security forces prevented a breach into Israel's borders.""  Medical units carry away a wounded Palestinian shot by Israeli forces during a protest on the border fence separating Israel and Gaza on May 14, 2018.  Calm on the borders  At the protest encampments that dot Gaza's border with Israel, the numbers of demonstrators have dwindled. Mosques and political factions that called on Palestinians to take to the border over the weekend were largely quiet on Tuesday.  Demonstrators also appeared skeptical that protests would continue. Several said they felt abandoned by political parties and protest organizers.  ""It's enough death. Those who died it's enough,"" said Mahmoud Yasser Mohammed, a demonstrator who stayed at the camps over night.  ""All the youth are just coming down to take selfies. There is no point. We cut the fence and opened the way and everyone was too scared to cross and the Israelis started firing on us,"" said another demonstrator Sayed Abu Nada.  Over 2,700 people suffered injuries, nearly half of them by live fire, according to the health ministry. Doctors told CNN they operated on many young men with gunshot wounds.  International condemnation has poured in over Israel's use of force against unarmed Palestinian protesters.  Doctors Without Borders called on the Israeli army to stop using deadly force against demonstrators, saying their actions were ""unacceptable and inhuman.""  ""This bloodbath is the continuation of the Israeli army's policy during the last seven weeks: shooting with live ammunition at demonstrators, on the assumption that anyone approaching the separation fence is a legitimate target,"" Marie-Elisabeth Ingres, the group's representative in Gaza, said in a statement.  French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned ""the violence of the Israeli forces against protesters.""  In a phone call with Abbas, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""condemned the attacks and wished Allah's mercy to all martyrs,"" according to the official Anadolu news agency. Turkey is recalling its ambassadors to Washington and Tel Aviv for consultations, according to state-run Anadolu Agency.  United Nations Secretary-General AntÃƒÂ³nio Guterres was ""profoundly alarmed"" by the violence in Gaza and urged Israeli forces to ""exercise maximum restraint in the use of live fire,"" his deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said.  A Palestinian carries an injured man during protests near the border between the Gaza strip and Israel on May 14, 2018.  A proposed UN Security Council press statement, put forward by Kuwait, was blocked by the US, according to a UN diplomat.  The draft statement, seen by CNN, included language expressing ""outrage and sorrow at the killing of Palestinian civilians exercising their right to peaceful protest.""  It also reaffirmed UN resolutions on the status of Jerusalem, saying that recent events had ""no legal effect"" under international law. The statement was withdrawn once the US indicate that it would block it, a UN diplomat said.  'Retaliation is imminent'  Hamas, which controls the Gaza strip, has vowed ""retaliation"" for the death of the protesters.  ""Retaliation is imminent,"" political bureau member Khalil Al-Hayya told reporters late on Monday.  ""The shedding of our people's blood today stains the faces of those normalizing [relations] with the Israeli Occupation and bargaining on the Palestinian cause with shame,"" Al-Hayya said.  Addressing the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, he said: ""the American administration bears all the consequences of the implementation of this unjust decision.""  Separately, the former head of the Hamas Political Bureau Khaled Meshaal called for Arab and international solidarity in a statement on Tuesday. ""Our people, who are [rising] up in Gaza and the West Bank, call on our Arab and Islamic nation, its people, its leaders, scientists and friends in the world to stand with us at this historic moment.""  Violent response  The deaths came after 35,000 protesters gathered at the border of Gaza and Israeli territory Monday to object to the embassy move, continuing the ""Great March of Return"" demonstrations. The protests have been taking place since March, in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel and expulsion of thousands of Palestinians.  Most of the dead were killed by Israeli fire near the border, after troops used tear gas and live ammunition to try and disperse the crowd. Israeli drones also dropped tear gas in an effort to disperse the protesters.  Palestinians rush to the border fence with Israel as mass demonstrations at the fence continue on May 14, 2018 in Gaza.  In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accused the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza, of ""leading a terrorist operation"" and inciting the protesters to conduct what Israel described as terror attacks.  The IDF alleged some protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails, and burned tires. It also claimed to have foiled an attack by three armed Palestinians near Rafah, close to the border with Egypt, during ""a particularly violent demonstration.""  Many of the injured Palestinians were young men who were hit by live ammunition, according to British-Palestinian Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitteh, who spoke to CNN from a hospital run by a British charity in Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza.  Monday's death toll was the biggest number of fatalities suffered in one day since the latest round of demonstrations began more than six weeks ago. The previous high was 17, which happened on the day the protests started on March 30.",en,terrorattack,389,['Gaza']

Monday's violence on the border, which took place as the United States opened its new embassy in Jerusalem, was the bloodiest for Palestinians since the 2014 Gaza conflict.  Advertisement  The death toll rose to 60 overnight after an eight-month-old baby died from tear gas that her family said she inhaled at a protest camp on Monday. More than 2,200 Palestinians were also injured by gunfire or tear gas, Palestinian medics said.  Palestinian leaders have called Monday's events a massacre, and the Israeli tactic of using live fire against the protesters has drawn worldwide concern and condemnation.  The United Nations Security Council was due to meet to discuss the situation.  Israel has said it is acting in self-defence to defend its borders and communities. Its main ally the United States has backed that stance, with both saying that Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the coastal enclave, instigated the violence.  Advertisement  Advertisement  On Tuesday morning, mourners marched through Gaza, waving Palestinian flags and calling for revenge.  ""With souls and blood we redeem you martyrs,"" they shouted.  There were fears of further bloodshed as a six-week protest campaign was due to reach its climax.  May 15 is traditionally the day Palestinians mark the ""Nakba"", or Catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes in violence culminating in war between the newly created Jewish state and its Arab neighbours in 1948.  The protests, dubbed ""The Great March of Return,"" began on Mar 30 and revived calls for refugees to have the right of return to their former lands, which now lie inside Israel.  Israel rejects any right of return, fearing that it would deprive the state of its Jewish majority.  Palestinian medical officials say 105 Gazans have now been killed since the start of the protests and nearly 11,000 people wounded, about 3,500 of them hit by live fire. Israeli officials dispute those numbers. No Israeli casualties have been reported.  More than 2 million people are crammed into the narrow Gaza Strip, more than two thirds of them refugees. Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt maintain tight restrictions on the enclave, deepening economic hardship and raising humanitarian concerns.  SHARPSHOOTERS  On the Israeli side of the border, Israeli sharpshooters took up positions to stop any attempted breach of the fence should demonstrations break out again. Tanks were also deployed.  A senior Israeli commander said that of the 60 Gazans killed on Monday, 14 were carrying out attacks and 14 others were militants.  He also said Palestinians protesters were using hundreds of pipe bombs, grenades and fire-bombs. Militants had opened fire on Israeli troops and tried to set off bombs by the fence.  Many casualties were caused by Palestinians carrying out devices that went off prematurely,"" he said.  ""We approve every round fired before it is fired. Every target is spotted in advance. We know where the bullet lands and where it is aimed,"" said the commander, who spoke on condition that he not be named, in accordance with Israeli regulations.  ""However reality on the ground is such that unintended damage is caused,"" he said.  In Geneva, the UN human rights office condemned what it called the ""appalling deadly violence"" by Israeli forces.  UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said Israel had a right to defend its borders according to international law, but lethal force must only be used a last resort, and was not justified by Palestinians approaching the Gaza fence.  The UN rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Michael Lynk, said Israel's use of force may amount to a war crime.  YOUNG VICTIM  In Gaza City, hundreds marched in the funeral of eight-month-old Leila al-Ghandour, whose body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag.  ""Let her stay with me, It is too early for her to go,"" her mother cried, pressing the baby's body to her chest.  Speaking earlier, her grandmother said the child was at one of the tented protest camps and had inhaled tear gas.  ""When we got back home, the baby stopped crying and I thought she was asleep. I took her to the children's hospital and the doctor told me she was martyred (dead),"" Heyam Omar said.  Many shops in East Jerusalem were shut throughout the day following a call by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for a general strike across the Palestinian Territories. A 70-second siren was sounded in the occupied West Bank in commemoration of the Nakba.

REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa  HOLY CITY  Most Gaza protesters stay around tent camps but groups have ventured closer to the border fence, rolling burning tyres and throwing stones. Some have flown kites carrying containers of petrol that spread fires on the Israeli side.  Monday's protests were fuelled by the opening ceremony for the new US Embassy in Jerusalem following its relocation from Tel Aviv. The move fulfilled a pledge by US President Donald Trump, who in December recognised the contested city as the Israeli capital.  Palestinians envision East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they hope to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel regards all of Jerusalem, including the eastern sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed, as its ""eternal and indivisible capital"".  Most countries say the status of Jerusalem - a sacred city to Jews, Muslims and Christians - should be determined in a final peace settlement and that moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal.  Netanyahu praised Trump's decisions but Palestinians have said the United States can no longer serve as an honest broker in any peace process. Talks aimed a finding a two-state solution to the conflict have been frozen since 2014.  Trump said on Monday he remained committed to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. His administration says it has nearly completed a new Israeli-Palestinian peace plan but is undecided on how and when to roll it out.  Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the Gaza violence. Hamas denied instigating it but the White House backed Netanyahu, saying Hamas ""intentionally and cynically provoking this response"".  The United States on Monday blocked a Kuwait-drafted UN Security Council statement that would have expressed ""outrage and sorrow at the killing of Palestinian civilians"" and called for an independent investigation, UN diplomats said.  In the British parliament, junior foreign office minister Alistair Burt said the United States needed to show more understanding about the causes of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Hamas' role in the violence must be investigated, he added.  ",en,terrorattack,389,"['Israel', 'Israel']"

It appeared that many protesters had gone to mourning tents rather than back to the scene of Monday's bloodshed. Mourners marched through the strip, waving Palestinian flags and calling for revenge.  Advertisement  ""With souls and blood we redeem you martyrs,"" they shouted.  Hundreds marched in the funeral of eight-month-old Leila al-Ghandour, whose body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag.  ""Let her stay with me, it is too early for her to go,"" her mother cried, pressing the baby's body to her chest. The family said she died of inhaling tear gas.  At Gaza's hospitals, families crowded the halls and spilled out of rooms as patients awaited treatment. Bassem Ibrahim, who said he was shot in the leg by Israeli troops, said at one stage he had feared losing the limb because of the delays.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""There are not many doctors. They are unable to see everyone, with all the injuries,"" said Ibrahim, 23. ""The number was unbelievable and they did not have time.""  On the Israeli side of the border, Israeli sharpshooters took up positions to stop any attempted breach of the fence should demonstrations break out again. Tanks were also deployed.  But if the violence tapered off, it still had a forceful impact internationally, with countries criticising both the Israeli use of deadly force and the U.S. decision to open its new embassy at a ceremony attended by President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.  Turkey expelled Israel's ambassador, and Israel expelled the Turkish consul-general in Jerusalem. President Tayyip Erdogan exchanged heated words on Twitter with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Palestinians summoned home their representative in Washington, citing the embassy decision.  Netanyahu blamed Hamas for provoking the violence. ""TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pushing civilians Ã¢â‚¬â€œ women, children Ã¢â‚¬â€œ into the line of fire with a view of getting casualties. We try to minimize casualties. They're trying to incur casualties in order to put pressure on Israel, which is horrible,"" Netanyahu told CBS News.  The United States echoed that charge, with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert saying the United States regretted all loss of life but blaming ""the misery that is faced by people in Gaza"" on Hamas. She said Hamas used the U.S. embassy move ""as an excuse to rile people up and to encourage violence.""  ""We have seen how Hamas continues to incite violence,"" she told a briefing. ""The activities that are taking place there ... would certainly stop if violent protests were to stop.""  For six weeks, Palestinians have been holding Gaza border demonstrations demanding access to family land or homes lost to Israel when it was founded in the 1948 Middle East war. Israel rejects that demand, fearing it would deprive the state of its Jewish majority.  Palestinian medical officials say 107 Gazans have now been killed since the start of the protests and nearly 11,000 people wounded, about 3,500 of them by live fire. Israeli officials dispute those numbers. No Israeli casualties have been reported.  Palestinian leaders have called Monday's events a massacre, and the Israeli tactic of using live fire against the protesters has drawn worldwide concern and condemnation.  The United Nations Security Council met to discuss the situation.  Israel has said it is acting in self-defence to protect its borders and communities. Its main ally, the United States, has backed that stance. Hamas, which rules Gaza and opposes Israel's existence, denies instigating violence.  The Israeli military said at least 24 of those killed on Monday were ""terrorists with documented terror background"" and most of them were active operatives of Hamas.  The Islamic Jihad militant group posted portraits of three uniformed members whom it said were killed when they took part as non-combatants in the protests, and the Hamas-led interior ministry posted pictures of 10 of its security men killed in the protests whom it said were unarmed and monitoring the crowds.  May 15 is traditionally the day Palestinians mark the ""Nakba"", or Catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes in violence culminating in war between the newly created Jewish state and its Arab neighbours in 1948.  More than 2 million people are crammed into the Gaza Strip, more than two-thirds of them refugees. Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt maintain tight curbs on the enclave, deepening economic hardship and raising humanitarian concerns.  A senior Israeli commander said that of the 60 Gazans killed on Monday, 14 were carrying out attacks and 14 others were militants.  He also said Palestinians protesters were using hundreds of pipe bombs, grenades and fire-bombs. Militants had opened fire on Israeli troops and tried to set off explosives by the fence.  Many casualties were caused by Palestinians carrying devices that went off prematurely,"" he said.  In Geneva, the U.N. human rights office condemned what it called the ""appalling deadly violence"" by Israeli forces.  U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said Israel had a right to defend its borders according to international law, but lethal force must only be used a last resort, and was not justified by Palestinians approaching the Gaza fence.  The U.N. rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Michael Lynk, said Israel's use of force may amount to a war crime.  YOUNG VICTIM  Many shops in East Jerusalem were shut throughout the day following a call by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for a general strike across the Palestinian Territories. A 70-second siren was sounded in the occupied West Bank in commemoration of the Nakba.  Most Gaza protesters stay around tent camps but groups have ventured closer to the border fence, rolling burning tyres and throwing stones. Some have flown kites carrying containers of petrol that spread fires on the Israeli side.  On Tuesday the number of protesters gathered at the frontier was estimated by the Israeli army at 4,000, well down on Monday.  Monday's protests were fuelled by the opening ceremony for the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem following its relocation from Tel Aviv. The move fulfilled a pledge by U.S. President Donald Trump, who in December recognised the city as Israel's capital.  Palestinians envision East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they hope to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel regards all of Jerusalem, including the eastern sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which it later annexed, as its ""eternal and indivisible capital"".  Most countries say the status of Jerusalem - a sacred city to Jews, Muslims and Christians - should be determined in a final peace settlement and that moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal.  Netanyahu on Monday praised Trump but Palestinians have said the United States can no longer serve as an honest broker in any peace process. Talks aimed at finding a two-state solution to the conflict have been frozen since 2014.  Trump said on Monday he remained committed to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. His administration says it has nearly completed a new Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.  Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the Gaza violence. Hamas denied instigating it but the White House backed Netanyahu, saying Hamas ""intentionally and cynically"" provoked this response.  The United States on Monday blocked a Kuwait-drafted U.N. Security Council statement that would have expressed ""outrage and sorrow at the killing of Palestinian civilians"" and called for an independent investigation, U.N. diplomats said.  In the British parliament, junior foreign office minister Alistair Burt said the United States needed to show more understanding about the causes of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Hamas' role in the violence must be investigated, he added.

Rare images from inside Yemen's city of Taiz show the devastation wrought by months of fighting between Houthi forces backed by Iran and Yemeni government forces, bolstered by Saudi Arabia and its US-equipped air power. They also expose the startling levels of hunger and disease in a conflict that so often goes unseen, even though a child under the age of five dies of preventable causes every 10 minutes  The fight in Taiz has led to a slow victory for the Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces, but at a great cost to the city and its inhabitants.  Startling drone footage by Brazilian photographer Gabriel Chaim shows how barely a wall has escaped the force of Saudi air power, and at times Houthi shelling too.  Mayhoub, a US aid worker from Washington, DC, set up a charity in Taiz after finding himself trapped in the city by the war when visiting his sick mother. He happened to be in hospital when he saw an eight-year-old girl come in with horrific injuries from shelling.  ""A little girl came into the hospital with her heart out,"" Mayhoub told CNN, without giving his full name as aid workers are often targeted in Taiz. ""And you could see her heart pumping. It's inhumane. Who sends shells into the most heavily crowded city in Yemen?""  Mayhoub led Chaim, the photographer, around the city, explaining where the Houthis retained positions from where they could shell Taiz. The conflict in the city has been further complicated as the Houthis' enemies have begun fighting among themselves, making a reprieve in the violence even less likely.  The impact on the youngest Yemenis is also acute, as images from Camp al Mahu -- a haven near Lahj -- devastatingly show. Here, tiny nine-year-old Mailiki Seif weighs just 2 kilograms, reduced to twigs of bone. Her mother, Mariam, says this is actually an improvement.  ""When we came here as displaced people, there was nothing wrong with her,"" she said, cradling her daughter's fragile frame. ""Then she started to have measles, diarrhea and vomiting. She got very skinny."" Only emergency rations have kept the little girl alive.  Mariam said she is from the Red Sea city of Mokha, but airstrikes forced her family to flee. Her husband's brother and son were among 25 people who died in a strike.  ""They were hit by a jet in the market. The airstrikes were hitting very close to our home."" She said they fled to the camp ""because there is war everywhere except for here.""  Only the pro-government Yemeni forces benefit from the backing of an air force -- usually Saudi but sometimes from the United Arab Emirates.  The Saudi air force has been accused of causing hundreds of civilian casualties in their intensive bombardment of Houthi-controlled areas.  The country and its allies back the internationally recognized Yemeni government and has imposed blockades on the parts of the country several times, hampering the delivery of aid.  More than 10,000 civilians have died and 40,000 have been wounded in the war, which has left 15 million Yemenis without access to clean water.  Saudi Arabia denies targeting civilians and rejected a UN report last year that blacklisted the country for deaths and injuries to children in the Yemen war.  During recent congressional testimony, Senator Elizabeth Warren asked if the US military was -- when it gets credible reports that civilians were killed in Saudi airstrikes -- ""able to tell if US fuel or US munitions were used in that strike?""  Votel replied: ""No, Senator, I don't believe we are.""",en,terrorattack,,

1636594,cnn,Michael Kugelman,Uproar over diplomat's car crash strains ties between US and Pakistan,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/15/opinions/pakistan-us-diplomat-intl/index.html,15/5/2018 0:00,16/5/2018 19:21,"Michael Kugelman is the senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. You can follow him @michaelkugelman. The views expressed are his own.  (CNN) Pakistan has relented and allowed a US diplomat accused of running a red light and killing a motorcycle driver to leave the country but the incident has already strained ties between the two uneasy allies.  The move comes after Colonel Joseph Emanuel Hall, a US military attachÃƒÂ© in Islamabad, was barred from leaving on a US military plane that arrived Saturday.  Pakistan had initially insisted that he couldn't leave because he was the subject of a criminal investigation but Washington argued that Hall's diplomatic immunity shielded him from legal action in Pakistan.  Washington's refusal to give ground has further deepened tensions in a relationship that's been on a collision course ever since the Trump administration announced its South Asia strategy last August.  A Pakistani policeman walks past a car of an American diplomat parked inside a police station after an accident in Islamabad on April 8, 2018.  New strategy  That strategy vowed to compel Pakistan to crack down on terrorists on its soil that target Americans in Afghanistan.  It also called on India, Pakistan's bitter rival, to step up its role in Afghanistan Ã¢â‚¬â€ thereby playing to longstanding Pakistani fears of India deepening its footprint on Pakistan's western flank.  However, despite this turmoil, the relationship hasn't exactly ground to a halt. High-level diplomacy, i ncluding a March visit to Islamabad by Alice Wells, a top State Department South Asia official, has continued.  One reason the relationship hasn't taken a bigger plunge is that the Trump administration hasn't followed through with major punitive measuresÃ¢â‚¬â€from expanding drone strikes and sanctioning Pakistani officials with ties to terrorists to designating Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorÃ¢â‚¬â€that analysts and administration officials themselves in past months suggested could be in the offing.  The White House worries that taking such harsh steps could prompt Pakistan to retaliate by shutting down supply lines on its soil used by the US military in Afghanistan.  Shutting down those routes would require America to use more costly and circuitous alternative routes in Central Asia. Additionally, given the poor state of US-Russia relations, as well as Moscow's deepening relations with Islamabad, Russia may try to hamper US access to them.  Hands tied  In effect, the Trump administration can't wield a bigger stick in Pakistan because it knows its hands are tied.  Instead, over the course of 2018, the United States has targeted Pakistan with more modest moves less likely to trigger a supply lines shutdown. Indeed, given that the supply lines are Pakistan's most powerful tool of leverage, Islamabad will hold its fire as long as it canÃ¢â‚¬â€and close them down only if provoked in a really big way.  The more modest measures are a far and weaker cry from the muscular moves threatened by the administration earlier.  Perhaps most dramatically, Washington this month blocked a request by Pakistan at the United Nations Security Council to designate Omar Khorasani, an especially vicious Pakistani militant, as a terrorist.  Last year, Washington targeted Khorasani in a drone strike in Afghanistan (which he apparently survived, despite initial reports that he died).  Jamaat-ul-Ahra, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, has carried out suicide attacks.  In 2016, it formally designated his organization, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, as a terrorist outfit. T he fact that a self-proclaimed tough-on-terror Trump administration refused to recognize Khorasani as a UN-designated terrorist speaks volumes about the White House's determination to undermine Pakistan.  Islamabad has retaliated to one of these moves. It imposed its own restrictions on US diplomats, including one that forbids them from using vehicles with tinted glass. The privacy and security implications of such a move could be unnerving to Washington.  US officials may not be taking the harshest possible measures in Pakistan, but they're still provoking hard and hurting feelings there. Khorasani has been implicated in dozens of attacks across Pakistan; few terrorists have as much Pakistani blood on their hands.  Understandably, Pakistani officialdom and the Pakistani public alike are incensed about Washington's refusal to sanction him at the UN.  Ultimately, Washington's policy amounts to pressuring Pakistan with pinpricks. It's a policy unlikely to achieve its main aim, which is getting Pakistan to target the terrorists on its soil that are killing Americans in Afghanistan. But it's guaranteed to keep US-Pakistan relations icy for the foreseeable future.",en,terrorattack,,
1638816,cnn,Nicole Gaouette,Iraqi election makes US foe Muqtada al-Sadr a potential kingmaker,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/16/politics/sadr-iraq-us-election/index.html,16/5/2018 0:00,17/5/2018 5:33,"Washington (CNN) Anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's coalition election victory in Iraq raises the prospect that the man many US military officials hold responsible for the deaths of US troops could become a kingmaker in Iraqi politics.  Al-Sadr has long positioned himself as an independent nationalist, a foe of both Iran and the US, both of which have sought to influence Iraq's trajectory since the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.  Al-Sadr campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, allied himself with the Communist Party and, like so many politicians across the world, rode a wave of populist sentiment to victory. He knocked out Washington's preferred candidate, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who finished in third place.  While al-Sadr carries the weight of years of bad blood with the US, after leading two insurgencies against American forces in Iraq, some analysts say the math of Iraqi coalition building means he won't necessarily determine the shape of Iraq's immediate future.  If he does become Iraq's power broker, others say al-Sadr has developed a more pragmatic approach over time, noting his openness to the US military presence in Iraq to support the fight against ISIS.  Bad news for who?  ""Is this bad news for Iran, or bad news for America?"" asked Randa Slim, director of conflict resolution at the Middle East Institute. ""It's bad news for both. I think there is a lot of concern, but if anybody has been following his political and ideological trajectory, this is a guy who has evolved into a pragmatic actor.""  Slim noted that al-Sadr publicly said he was fine with a US presence in Iraq to fight ISIS and to equip and train Iraqi troops, as long as it didn't impinge on Iraqi sovereignty. About 5,000 US troops are stationed in the country.  Fifteen years after the US-led invasion of Iraq, officials in Washington reacted to the news about al-Sadr with neutral caution.  ""The United States congratulates Iraq and its people for voting and participating in the democratic process,"" a National Security Council spokesman said Tuesday. ""While the final vote tallies and seat allocations have not yet been certified, preliminary results demonstrate that Iraqis are eager to build a safe and prosperous future for themselves, in the context of a nationalist, centrist government that is sovereign and stable.""  ""We look forward to working with the new Iraqi government that emerges from the Iraqi constitutional process,"" the spokesman said, ""to help deliver stability, security and prosperity for all Iraqis.""  The cleric's victory could pose complications for President Donald Trump. Senior US troops and commanders feel al-Sadr is responsible for the deaths of many US troops and will be watching closely to see how much of a box Trump will be in, if the US does have to deal with him.  The US military focus on al-Sadr had been intense. In 2004, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of coalition ground forces in the US-led occupation of Iraq, said that ""the mission of the US forces is to kill or capture Muqtada al-Sadr. That's our mission.""  At the Pentagon on Tuesday, Defense Secretary James Mattis was asked if he was angered by the election results, given al-Sadr's role in killing so many American and coalition troops. Mattis served in Iraq and headed US Central Command, which oversees the Middle East.  ""The Iraqi people had an election,"" Mattis said. ""That's a democratic process at a time when people, many people, doubted that Iraq could take charge of themselves. So we will wait and see the results, the final results of the election, but we stand with the Iraqi people's decision.""  After the Iraq Electoral Commission finished more than 90% of the counting in 18 provinces and initial results showed al-Sadr's coalition in first place, Abadi called ""on citizens and the political coalitions to respect the election results"" in a televised speech broadcast on Iraqiya state TV.  Some US concern is driven by the dangerous undertow of Iraq's sectarian politics: For the first time since the fall of Saddam, Shiite Muslim parties are theoretically able to form a government without Sunni Muslim or Kurdish participation, said Michael Pregent, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.  JUST WATCHED Long-time U.S. enemy threatens ISIS leader Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Long-time U.S. enemy threatens ISIS leader 02:28  Pregent, a former intelligence adviser to Gen. David Petraeus and Gen. Ray Odierno in Iraq, says Sunni Arabs and the Kurds ""have been the bulwark against Iran in the past, and against the existential threats of ISIS and al Qaeda.""  If Shiite parties form a government without other groups, Pregent said, it would likely lead to continued instability in Iraq.  Sectarianism has been a major problem in Iraq. Under Saddam, majority Shiites were brutally repressed by minority Sunnis, who dominated politics and state institutions. With the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the fall of Saddam, sectarian violence exploded as Shiite leaders exacted revenge for decades of oppression.  Pregent alluded to the ties between some of Iraq's Shiite political parties and Iran.  ""If you simply allow the Shiite political parties, the 60% population of Iraq, to form a government, we will continue to have an unstable northern Iraq where threats are incubated,"" Pregent said, ""and Baghdad and Iran have no interest in stopping it because it justifies militias, it justifies Iran being in Iraq, it justifies Syria.""  Slim points out that al-Sadr is no great fan of Iran and has already said he's not willing to form a government with pro-Iranian parties that would be problematic for Washington. ""He's looking for a governing alliance with people who aren't seen maybe as pro-West allies but are seen as possible for the West and the US,"" Slim said, citing Abadi and Kurdish groups as possible partners al-Sadr might seek.  And like Pregent, she points out that in the fluid give-and- take of Iraqi politics, it's very possible that al-Sadr might not end up being Iraq's new power broker.  Indeed, pro-Iranian parties have begun working to try to outflank al-Sadr. Agence France-Presse has reported that the powerful Iranian general Qassem Soleimani met with Abadi and pro-Iranian politicians this week in a bid to create a bloc large enough to displace al-Sadr.",en,terrorattack,,
1641417,channelnewsasia,None,"Founded to protest Pakistan ""disappearances"", group now sees supporters go missing",http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/founded-to-protest-pakistan--disappearances---group-now-sees-supporters-go-missing-10241854,,17/5/2018 16:57,"KARACHI: As they were about to enter the office of the Commissioner of Karachi for a meeting to discuss a rally planned in Pakistan's largest city, leaders of a Pashtun-led rights movement were intercepted by armed men accompanied by paramilitary Rangers.  ""A car with men in plainclothes pulled up in front of us and men with guns got out and told us to stand still,"" Said Alam Mahsud, an organiser with the Pashtun Tahafaz Movement (PTM), told Reuters.  Advertisement  He said three PTM activists with him were put in a truck and taken away by the armed men, as uniformed Rangers stood by. They returned two days later saying they had been interrogated, threatened, punched and kicked by the unidentified men, then handed over to the Rangers, who released them.  PTM, which drew nearly 10,000 people to its Karachi rally on Sunday, was founded in January in protest against alleged extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention and ""disappearances"" of young Pashtun men.  Leaders of the emerging movement have blamed Pakistan's military for these abuses, in an unusually direct challenge to the country's most powerful institution.  Now, PTM's activists themselves have started disappearing, according to Mohsin Dawar, one of the movement's leaders.  Advertisement  Advertisement  PTM organisers again blame the powerful military, saying the movement's growing popularity in major cities, even amid a local media blackout, has left the security forces feeling threatened.  The military's press wing did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations. In the past, the army has said it does not detain individuals without evidence.  Officials from the paramilitary Rangers, which are part of the security forces and have broad powers in Karachi, also did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the office of the Karachi Commissioner, who is the head of the city government.  ""ANTI-STATE AGENDA""  In the past month, PTM says dozens of its activists have been detained across the country, while newspaper columnists have had articles on PTM rejected. Some students and academics say they have been threatened and universities forced to call off talks about Pashtun inequality.  In the week leading up to the Karachi protest, PTM's leadership said Rangers and unidentified security officials detained and interrogated more than 100 of its supporters and kept nearly 30 workers in custody.  ""The amount they are trying to stop us, it shows they are scared,"" student activist Manzoor Pashteen, who has become the face of the movement, told Reuters. ""I don't think they know they are our guardians, their behaviour is that of criminals.""  Despite the apparent crackdown, the protest in Karachi drew nearly 10,000 people. Pashteen himself was stopped from boarding a flight from the capital, Islamabad, to Karachi on Saturday after the airline told him his ticket had been cancelled, he said, adding it took him 40 hours to drive to the city after being stopped and detained several times while on the road.  While there has been no official action against the PTM, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa said recently that ""no anti-state agenda in the garb of engineered protests"" would be allowed to succeed. His comments were widely interpreted as being directed at the group.  Many of Pakistan's 30 million ethnic Pashtun's hail originally from the borderlands with Afghanistan, where the Pakistani Taliban controlled swathes of territory until they were pushed out by military operations in 2009 and 2014.  PTM leaders say they do not want to challenge the government or undermine security, but complain Pashtuns - many of whom have moved to the cities to escape a near-decade long insurgency by Islamist militants - are unfairly targeted and suffer abuses at the hands of security forces in the name of fighting terrorism.  CAMPUS CHALLENGE  In April, a week before PTM was due to stage a rally in Lahore, Habib University in Karachi and the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) called off talks related to Pashtun rights organised by students and academics.  On the morning of the talks, both universities received calls from security officials, including representatives of Pakistan's spy agency the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), telling them to cancel the discussions, faculty members said.  ""Calls were made to the administration as well as in-person visits from people who identified themselves as ISI,"" said a LUMS professor. ""I received a call and was told to refrain from anti-military activity.""  Officials from the ISI did not respond to a request for comment.  At Habib University, the administration received visits from security officials and a call on the morning the lecture was due to take place, three different faculty members said.  Representatives from LUMS and Habib University did not respond to requests for comment.  Three students who had expressed support for PTM on social media told Reuters they had received threatening calls from unknown numbers telling them to stop, adding they knew of a dozen others who had received similar calls.  The same week, Punjab University professor Ammar Ali Jan said he was removed from his post for encouraging students to be vocal about human rights issues and supporting PTM.  Punjab University spokesman Khurram Shahzad said Jan was dismissed because of incomplete paperwork.  Pakistan's minister for state and interior affairs, Talal Chaudhry, said such actions ""by unnamed forces"" were part of a wider clampdown on freedom of thought in Pakistan.  ""We now have to listen to the people of Pakistan,"" Chaudhry said. ""There have been very few such things in Pakistan's history where people come out on their own, to support a leaderless group,"" he added, referring to PTM.  Relations between the army and civilian government have been increasingly strained since the removal of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the courts last year, with some ruling party insiders accusing elements of the military of trying to destabilise it ahead of a general election expected in July.  The military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half its history, denies any interference in civilian politics.  CRACKDOWN IN KARACHI  Mohsin Dawar arrived in Karachi on May 6 and, along with other PTM leaders, began meeting local Pashtuns to plan the weekend rally.  ""From the day we arrived they began arresting our supporters,"" Dawar said.  People who provided PTM with logistical support, such as a place to hold their meetings, were picked up for five to six hours and threatened, he said.  ""They told them not to support us; that we will leave Karachi but they have to continue living here,"" Dawar added.  Karachi is where the killing of a young Pashtun, Naqeebullah Mehsud, by police in January sparked nationwide peaceful demonstrations about Pashtun rights, from which PTM emerged.  Organisers say they attempted to contract vendors to supply chairs, a stage, and a sound system for the rally, but none of the equipment was delivered.  One vendor, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters he received a call after meeting PTM members. ""They said that if even one candle was delivered to the rally, my body would never be found,"" he said.

It has reached Mbandaka, the capital of the country's Equateur province.  Health minister Oly Ilunga said two suspected cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the Wangata health zones - including in Mbandaka, a city of about 1.2 million people.  The city lies about 93 miles from Bikoro, where the current outbreak was announced last week.  He said one sample proved positive for the Ebola virus, meaning there have now been three confirmed cases in three different health zones.  Mr Ilunga said Congo now is entering an urban phase of the outbreak, meaning that the disease could spread more rapidly and further afield.  He said scientists are working to identify the number of people who may have had contact with the virus, on top of the 500 already identified.  Congo has reported 23 deaths among the 44 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.  It is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in the DRC.  Last year, eight people were infected and four people died after an outbreak of the disease, according to the Centres for Disease Control.  Ebola virus disease, formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.

The bright, happy child was a favourite of the housing complex security guard, 46-year-old Hery, who regarded Firman as his Ã¢â‚¬Å“little brother.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Advertisement  But last Sunday (May 13), something was amiss.  The familiar smile was missing. Instead, the teenager was crying. His father, Dita Oepriarto, 46, stroked his head and patted his shoulders but he kept on crying.  Hery had come to the mosque to pray before he started his morning shift and he sat close to them.  In the stillness of dawn, Hery, overheard his father whispering Ã¢â‚¬Å“be patient, be sincereÃ¢â‚¬Â but the teenager could not be consoled. He continued crying.

(Photo: Amy Chew)  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I wanted to ask his father what was the matter but I stopped myself, as I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be seen as interfering in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affairs,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Hery.  When the prayers ended, Firman, his father and older brother, Yusof Fadhil, 18, got up to make their way home.  At that point, Firman saw his friend and for the first time, he neither acknowledged nor smiled at Hery.  Firman later climbed onto the back of a motorcycle and his older brother Yusof drove towards the Santa Maria Catholic church.  At the entrance, a churchgoer named Aloysius Bayu tried to stop them. A loud blast went off at 7.30am local time.  The two brothers, Aloysius and five other church members were killed.  Five minutes later, their father drove a bomb-laden car to the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church at 7.35am local time and detonated explosives.  Shortly after that, his wife, Puji Kuswati, 42 and her two daughters, Fadhila Sari, 12 and Famela Rizqita, nine, carried out a bomb attack on Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church.  Within 10 minutes, the entire family of six were dead. The suicide bombings at three churches killed 13 people and wounded another 41.  The abandoned home of Dita Oepriarto. (Photo: Amy Chew)  HE DID NOT WANT TO DIE A SUICIDE BOMBER: FIRMANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S FRIEND  Back at his home, Fery heard the news. He was stunned. He immediately thought he understood why Firman was crying Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he did not want to die.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I feel, I believe, he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to do it (die as a suicide bomber). This is not right, to drag children into this,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Hery, falling silent as he put his head down.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I feel a terrible loss,Ã¢â‚¬Â Hery added softly.  The day ended, but not the terror.  Later that night at 9.20pm local time, a bomb assembled by Anton Febrianto exploded prematurely in his home in Sidoarjo, just outside of Surabaya.  It killed his wife Puspitasari and their two children, Hilta Aulia Rahman, 17, and Ainur Rahman 15. Two other children, Faisa Putri and Garida Huda Akbar, respectively aged 11 and 10, survived.  On May 14, a family of five, riding on two separate motorcycles, attacked a police station in Surabaya, killing four members of the family. An eight-year-old child survived.  All three families knew each other, according to Indonesian police chief Tito Karnavian.  DITA - FATHER OF DEATH  Indonesian police said Dita was the head of the Surabaya branch of the pro-Islamic State (IS) Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD).  JAD was founded by Aman Abdurrahman, 46, who is IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost IS ideologue. He is currently on trial for his role in the 2016 Thamrin terror attack in Jakarta.  The horror of two families dying as suicide bombers raises the question - how Dita came to be radicalised to a twisted point that he was willing to lead his four children to death?  A senior counter-terrorism official told Channel NewsAsia that Dita was an avid follower of Aman Abdurrahman.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He visited Aman several times in prison and has long followed his sermons,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the official.  When asked where did Dita get the idea to turn his children into suicide bombers, the official said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know yet but they (Dita and his friends) very often watched suicide bombings carried out by children.""  The official added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“As the leader of JAD Surabaya, Dita could have influenced the other two families.""  While Indonesian police chief Tito has officially said that Dita and his family did not go to Syria, the actual situation is far more complicated.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really tell whether he (Dita) went to Syria or not as we have experienced instances where someone went to Syria and slipped back home undetected,Ã¢â‚¬Â a security source told Channel NewsAsia.  Official figures show there are 1,200 returnees from Syria and many of them are not detained owing to the weakness in IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anti-terrorism law 15/2003 which does not cover terror acts committed outside of Indonesia.  ""Officially, the figure shows 1,200 returnees from Syria. But unofficially, it numbers at least 2,000 or more,Ã¢â‚¬Â the source said.  ""This is a dilemma facing the country.""  FAMILY OF SUICIDE BOMBERS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND  Indonesian senior counter-terrorism officials and analysts told Channel NewsAsia the suicide bombings comprising an entire family was unprecedented and warned it could spawn similar copy cat bombings.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This family of suicide bombings can be copied by others not only in Indonesia but the rest of the world,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the senior counter-terrorism official.  Counter-terrorism expert Noor Huda Ismail, who started IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first private de-radicalisation programme, agrees.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean to be an alarmist but this (family suicide bombings) is very dangerous to the whole of Southeast Asia and the world.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are seeing a community that is fine with killing their own kids,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Huda, who is also a documentary film-maker.  According to Huda, children aged 13 have little understanding on whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on while those aged above 13 have the ability to comprehend.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Having said that, in a patriarchal society like Indonesia, it is very difficult for a child to escape a father's influence. These children were very helpless,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Huda.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“In this case, it is very clear the father, Dita, is very radical and his wife was influenced by him to go along with him with his suicide bombings. This makes the child very helpless as there is no one to protect them,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Huda.  Banner reads 'We are not afraid'. (Photo: Amy Chew)  BOMBED OUT CHURCH CALLS FOR FORGIVENESS  On Thursday, five days after the blast at Saint Maria Catholic church. The acrid smell of burnt flesh still hung in the air even as life returned to the church and the street that bore witness to the grisly attack.  Santa MariaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parish priest Father Kurdo Irianto was shocked when he learnt that the bombers included two teenagers.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They (teenaged suicide brothers) are victims too. I am not angry,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Father Kurdo.  Father Kurdo exhorted his congregation to forgive the perpetrators.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Forgive the perpetrators ... they are also victims. We need to forgive in order to rebuild a new life. Forgiveness is also the cornerstone of the Catholic faith,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  All around the city, banners saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are not afraidÃ¢â‚¬Â flutters in the air in a show of solidarity.  Yet taxi drivers were complaining the number of passengers they picked up had fallen since the bombings.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The malls are empty. There are very few people coming out hence the roads are not as jammed as usual. I am really angry and sad at the same time,Ã¢â‚¬Â said taxi driver Agus before driving into the night.",en,terrorattack,,
1646472,bangkokpost,Bangkok Post Public Company Limited,Kachin civilians flee Myanmar's 'forgotten war',https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/1468122/kachin-civilians-flee-myanmars-forgotten-war,,18/5/2018 15:04,"DANAI (MYANMAR) - Seng Moon grabbed her day-old baby and fled into the thick jungle, joining thousands of villagers escaping fighting between ethnic Kachin rebels and Myanmar's army, now reinforced by a unit notorious for its brutal ""clearance"" operations.  Fighting in the northeastern state of Kachin has surged dramatically this year, displacing 20,000 people since January  The insurgency in Myanmar's remote northeast has festered for six decades, but unlike the Rohingya crisis in the far west of the country, it has garnered few global headlines.  Fighting has surged dramatically this year, displacing 20,000 people since January, adding to the legions already uprooted by one of the world's longest-running civil wars.  Often called the ""forgotten war"", the Kachin conflict is a messy struggle over autonomy, ethnic identity, drugs, jade and other natural resources between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Myanmar state.  On April 11, with the sound of gunfire and fighter jets closing in, the villagers of Danai township sought refuge in their paddy fields.  Three days later shells started falling on their village and leaders took the decision for the 2,000 inhabitants to flee.  Seng Moon, 22, had given birth to her daughter only the day before.  ""I was still bleeding (from the birth) and I felt like I was dying,"" she told AFP at a camp in Danai town. ""It was so difficult and we had to cross a river.""  For the group that included many young children, as well as the sick and elderly, progress through the arduous jungle terrain was slow.  But they were lucky to encounter local elephant handlers -- known as mahouts -- who helped ferry the most vulnerable across a chest-deep river to a displacement camp in the grounds of a small, wooden church.  Ethnic Kachin are mainly Christians in a nation that is overwhelmingly Buddhist.  - 33rd Light Infantry -  International focus has been on the crisis in Rakhine state, from where some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have been driven into Bangladesh by a relentless military campaign the UN says amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"".  An army unit accused of atrocities against the Rohingya -- the 33rd Light Infantry Division -- has now been redeployed to Kachin.  While the scale of violence in Kachin does not match operations against the Rohingya, experts say the deployment of the unit is an ominous sign for civilians.  ""Yes, they are here,"" Kachin state minister for security and border affairs, Colonel Thura Myo Tin, told AFP without giving any further details about their mission.  Human Rights Watch accuses the unit of ""multiple massacres"" in northern Rakhine while Amnesty International has recorded ""violations"" against civilians on previous missions to Kachin.  ""Kachin civilians... have little hope of divisions like these changing their behaviour,"" HRW Myanmar researcher Rich Weir said.  - Surge in fighting -  The insurgency in the northeast is one of two dozen ethnic minority rebellions that have plagued Myanmar since independence from British colonial rule in 1948.  Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi said forging nationwide peace was her main priority after her government assumed power two years ago, ending decades of military domination. But the army still retains control over security issues.  The Kachin conflict reignited in 2011 after a 17-year ceasefire collapsed. Clashes have intensified since 2016, displacing more than 100,000 in Kachin and the north of neighbouring Shan state.  Independent analyst David Mathieson said the military appears to be taking advantage of the focus on the Rohingya to attack the KIA and bring it ""to the peace negotiation table"".  The military is also ""targeting the KIA's sources of income"" in amber and jade mining areas, he added.  Myanmar's army accuses the KIA of involvement in an attack at the weekend on security posts and a casino in Shan that left at least 19 dead.  The military says it is protecting the country's sovereignty and borders. But the KIA's political wing has a different view.  ""They are invaders. We are defenders,"" said Dau Hka, a spokesman for the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO).  ""The fighting will stop immediately"" once the military halts its offensive, he added.  - Peace protest crackdown -  The Kachin conflict is a powerful rallying cry in a country whose citizens suffered under decades of junta repression.  Youth groups have led peace protests that spread from Kachin's capital Myitkyina across the country.  In Myanmar's largest city Rangoon, riot police on Saturday arrested several demonstrators at a large rally.  Protest leaders in Kachin were also fined and will likely face further charges.  ""We haven't done anything wrong,"" said 24-year-old Sut Seng Htoi, co-leader of the Kachin Youth Movement.  ""We have only asked for help to allow the trapped people to escape.""  For now church grounds around Myitkyina are providing sanctuary to those able to escape remote villages.  Sin Na Khawn Bu's family says she is over 100 years old and was carried some 30 kilometres (19 miles) by her grandson to safety.  ""I have not been able to eat well for 12 days because I'm so afraid,"" the centenarian told AFP, stuttering and rocking back and forth as she spoke.  ""We are suffering a lot. Please help us.""",en,terrorattack,,

In a statement, the UN agency said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus would convene an emergency committee to discuss the matter.  Advertisement  He is due to speak to the media later on Friday.  The fresh Ebola outbreak, publicly declared on May 8 with 23 deaths so far, was first reported in a rural part of Equateur Province in the vast country's northwest but has now spread to the city of Mbandaka.  Mbandaka's population has been variously estimated at between 700,000 and 1.2 million.  Peter Salama, in charge of emergency response at the WHO, has said the spread to a city complicated the fight against Ebola, which depends on identifying and isolating suspected cases.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The city is on the banks of the Congo River which connects to the capital Kinshaha, hundreds of kilometres to the south, and also to surrounding countries, increasing the risk of a national and regional outbreak, according to WHO officials.  Ebola is lethal and highly contagious, which makes it difficult to contain - especially in urban environments where people are mobile and come into more contact with others.  Lacking an arsenal of drugs to treat the virus, doctors isolate patients and trace people who have been in contact with them.  The WHO revised its assessment of the risk of spread of the epidemic to ""very high"" at the national level and ""high"" for neighbouring countries.  Globally the risk of the outbreak spreading is classified as ""low"".  The current outbreak involves the same strain of the virus that hit three West African countries in 2013-15 and sparked an international panic.  It went on to kill more than 11,300 people, in the deadliest ever Ebola epidemic.  The WHO was fiercely criticised over its handling of the 2013 outbreak and has pledged to improve emergency response.  There is no licensed drug to treat or prevent Ebola, although an experimental vaccine arrived in the DRC on Wednesday and has been cleared for use by the Kinshasa government.",en,diseas,,

1658679,aljazeera,Halim Shebaya About The Author Halim Shebaya Is A Beirut-based Political Analyst Multi-disciplinary ,"Memo to Israel: Lebanon is not Hezbollah, Gaza is not Hamas",https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/memo-israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-hamas-180520122815960.html,,21/5/2018 6:07,"Israeli public relations efforts to turn attention away from inconvenient realities and to distract public opinion rest in large part on promoting simplified, dumbed-down messages.  Those can be easily parroted by complicit media outlets, think tanks, pundits, as well as by some journalists who prefer the sensationalism of ""Iranian mullahs"", ""Hezbollah plots"" and ""Hamas terrorists"" to the more complicated dynamics of the region and individual countries. Of course, in some situations, this is a good way to avoid an uncomfortable discussion about apartheid and occupation for fear of being labelled anti-semitic.  One clear example of such dumbed-down messages is Israeli education minister Naftali Bennett's ""Lebanon = Hezbollah"" tweet after Lebanon's parliamentary elections on May 6. ""Israel will not differentiate between the sovereign State of Lebanon and Hezbollah, and will view Lebanon as responsible for any action from within its territory"", he said in the tweet.  It was Bennnett again who in mid-May said that unarmed Palestinians protesting near the border fence in Gaza should be treated as ""terrorists"". By then the government he is part of had framed the Palestinians' Great March of Return as a ""Hamas ploy"".  What Israel aims to achieve by promoting this type of rhetoric is to turn both Lebanon and Gaza into legitimate targets for its aggression in any conflict that might take place in the future.  Lebanon is not Hezbollah  For those familiar with Israeli policies in Lebanon and the history of the conflict, this is ""nothing new under the sun"". Israeli officials have made it a habit to regularly threaten the entire population of Lebanon (and not only Hezbollah) with destruction, annihilation and blowing it back to the Stone Ages.  This inflammatory language in fact describes war crimes, which Israel has committed repeatedly on Lebanese territory. In the 2006 war, the Israeli army killed 1000 civilians and the Israeli government tried to blame it solely on Hezbollah.  But as a Human Rights Watch report investigating war crimes committed during that conflict pointed out: ""Responsibility for the high civilian death toll of the war in Lebanon lies squarely with Israeli policies and targeting decisions in the conduct of its military operations.""  {articleGUID}  This year, it was not only Israel who chose to read the May 6 elections from the prism of ""Lebanon = Hezbollah"". International (and some Arab) media were quick to dub the electoral results an outright Hezbollah victory.  This prompted local media and analysts to respond by pointing out that ""Hezbollah's electoral domination"" is a myth and a reductionist and inaccurate way of understanding what happened on May 6. There are many levels when it comes to reading the results of the Lebanese elections, and framing them as a ""Lebanon = Hezbollah"" outcome does not capture the complexity of what is happening in Lebanon today.  This is absolutely not to say that Hezbollah is not a powerful political and military force in Lebanon, or that the party does not pose a very serious challenge and obstacle to the emergence of a strong state. Hezbollah's weapons also play a role in Lebanese politics, as we saw in the organisation's May 2008 armed takeover of Beirut and also in its decision to get involved in Syria, without consulting with the government or parliament.  Indeed, one has to be very naÃƒÂ¯ve to claim that Hezbollah is simply a resistance movement and that its arsenal has no bearing on internal affairs or elections (both parliamentary and presidential).  But claims that Lebanon is now ""hostage"" to Hezbollah (and Iran) are exaggerated. Yet they are music to the ears of Israel which promotes this line to justify whatever war crimes its army will commit in any future conflict in the name of ""self-defence"" and ""war on terrorism"".  Gaza is not Hamas  Similarly in Palestine, we have seen an attempt to paint the recent protests in Gaza as Hamas-led and inspired, despite the fact that the organisers come from multiple Palestinian political and civil society groups.  Israel resorts to the ""Gaza = Hamas"" equation in order to justify the killing of 114 unarmed protestors and the injuring thousands who were simply marching for their right to return to their home and for an end to the occupation of Palestinian lands.  This line was repeated immediately by some Western governments and media. The Washington Post, for example, published a disgraceful editorial claiming that the protests were Hamas' way of launching a war and ""an attempt to breach the border fence, in the calculation that many would be killed"".  As in the case of Hezbollah, Hamas is not an innocent actor. It has been implicated in human rights violations in Gaza and breaches to international humanitarian law during armed conflicts. However, it takes a special kind of moral and intellectual bankruptcy to deny the facts on the ground - facts that are attested to by various United Nations and rights organisations.  Indeed, the dehumanisation of Palestinians has reached such an extent that even the human right to protest inhumane and unjust political and humanitarian conditions is denied to them. As pro-Israeli commentator wrote trying to justify the use of lethal force against protestors: all Israel wants from Gaza is ""peace and quiet"", but instead, its people decide to protest - as if, in 2018, protest is a crime punishable by death.  The 'post-truth' logic  When Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations, described the humanitarian outcry over Eastern Ghouta last February as ""mass psychosis"", I wrote about his statement in a column for Al Jazeera, calling it an example of the ""post-truth"" logic.  Unsurprisingly, the White House's deputy spokesperson Raj Shah and the US permanent representative to the UN Nikki Haley fit in perfectly, along with their Israeli allies, within such ""post-truth"" reasoning.  In response to the Gaza massacre and the cold-blooded shooting of Palestinians by Israeli snipers, Shah called the protest an ""unfortunate propaganda attempt"", whereas Haley did not have the moral courage to face her Palestinian counterpart at the Security Council and instead walked out of the meeting room.  Indeed, ""post-truth"" logic can't handle the truth. The reality of what happened in Gaza does not reflect the dumbed-down talking points we have been hearing from pro-Israeli pundits and officials on television and in the press.  The truth of the matter is that, as the UN Human Rights Commissioner put it, ""this was not 'a PR victory for Hamas'... it was a tragedy for thousands of families [and] the stark contrast in casualties on both sides is also suggestive of a wholly disproportionate responseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦""  Israel's occupation and apartheid regime must end in order to reach a just peace, both for the sake of Palestinians and Israelis. This is what the Gaza protests were essentially about.  And any attempt to frame them as a declaration of war, or simply as a ""Hamas ploy"" or a ""PR victory"", misses the point and is a clear attempt to distort reality and maintain the status quo in favour of Israel.

Successive governments have held talks with rebel groups aimed at bringing peace but the discussions have largely stalled, including under the current, military government.

GENEVA: The spread of Ebola to a major city in Democratic Republic of Congo is worrying but the outlook is much more optimistic than when a major outbreak was reported in West Africa in 2014, the head of the World Health Organization said on Monday.

This time the WHO has moved rapidly to mobilize the response, convening an Emergency Committee and sending a vaccine to ring-fence the outbreak and stop it spreading further.

The latest outbreak is Congo's ninth since the disease made its first known appearance near the vast central African country's northern Ebola river in the 1970s.  Tedros said WHO staff and health workers were working around the clock to stop the outbreak, and said he had been impressed by seeing health workers ""risking their own lives"" in the remote town of Bikoro a week ago, just after the outbreak was declared.  ""The outbreak in Bikoro illustrates again that health security and universal health coverage are two sides of the same coin. The best thing we can do to prevent future outbreaks is to strengthen health systems everywhere,"" Tedros said.  The outbreak has so far killed 26 of the 46 people thought to have been infected, Jasarevic said. Of that caseload, 21 have been confirmed in a laboratory, 21 are regarded as probable Ebola cases, and four patients are suspected of having Ebola.

The most severe and most common form of smallpox is known as variola major, which has four variants.  Types of variola smallpox:  Ordinary - most common, 90% of cases  Modified - mild and occurs in those having been vaccinated  Flat Hemorrhagic - the most rare, severe and usually fatal  Insects and animals do not transmit smallpox. If aerosolized smallpox were to be released, 90% of the virus would die within 24 hours.  Initial symptoms include high fever, fatigue, and head and back aches. A characteristic rash that is most prominent on the face, arms and legs follows in two to three days. The rash starts with flat red lesions that evolve at the same rate. Lesions become pus-filled and begin to crust early in the second week. Scabs develop and then separate and fall off after about three to four weeks.  The majority of patients with smallpox recover, but death occurs in up to 30% of cases.  1950s - Worldwide, 15 million cases of smallpox are reported each year in the decade; the highly contagious disease kills more than 500 million people worldwide over the last century.  1977 - The last naturally occurring case of smallpox in the world occurs in Somalia.  1979 - Smallpox meets the criteria for eradication by having no natural cases for two years. There are two sanctioned repositories for stocks of variola, the virus that causes smallpox. They are: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Russian State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo.  1980 - The World Health Organization announces the official eradication of smallpox.  2008 - According to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine, According to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine, ""researchers found that lifetime protection is obtained from just one vaccination, even when that vaccination occurred as much as 88 years ago. ""  2014 - Six vials containing the smallpox virus are found in an unused storage room at the Food and Drug Administration's Bethesda, Maryland, campus. Later testing shows that at least two of the vials, dating from 1954, contain the live virus.  2016 - The oldest known sample of the smallpox-causing The oldest known sample of the smallpox-causing variola virus is found within the DNA of a 17th century child mummy , in a crypt beneath a Lithuanian church, according to a study in the journal Current Biology. The finding shortens the timeline for how long smallpox may have afflicted humans.  Smallpox Vaccine:  In people exposed to smallpox, the vaccine can lessen the severity of or even prevent illness if given within three to four days after exposure.  Vaccine against smallpox contains a live virus called vaccinia, which is related to the variola virus that causes smallpox.  Exposure to the vaccinia pathogen in the vaccine can cause severe complications in rare cases. The people most at risk are those with compromised immune systems, like those with HIV or people undergoing cancer treatment. Also at risk are people with certain skin conditions who may be more sensitive to the virus in the vaccine.  Most Americans under 40 have not been vaccinated. The last smallpox case in the United States was in 1949, and routine vaccination stopped in 1972. Some medical and military personal are still vaccinated.  September 2002 - The CDC announces guidelines for all 50 states and the District of Columbia with instructions on how to vaccinate entire populations within a week of any outbreak.",en,diseas,,

He was 90.  Posada, who had been diagnosed with throat cancer about five years ago, died Wednesday at a care home for elderly veterans in Broward Country, north of Miami, according to Arturo Hernandez, a lawyer for the hardline exile.  ""An extraordinary life has ended,"" Hernandez told The Associated Press. ""It's a very sad morning for me, to say farewell to such a great man.""  Posada had been acquitted in 2011 by a federal jury in El Paso, Texas, of lying to U.S. officials about his role in the Havana bombings to win political asylum.  He was among a core group of Cuban exiles the CIA trained in the early 1960s in a failed effort to overthrow Fidel Castro's fledgling communist government. Unlike many others, he never renounced violence as a way to bring about change on the island.  ""If Castro came through the door, I'd kill him, not because I hate him but because I'd kill a cockroach too,"" Posada told the AP at one point during a series of interviews between 2009 and 2010.  To many older exiles, Posada was a freedom fighter who did what was necessary to attempt to overthrow a dictatorship. Many other people, like Peter Kornbluh, head of the independent National Security Archive's Cuba project that fought years to declassify documents relating to Posada, viewed him as an unrepentant terrorist.  ""The CIA created and unleashed a Frankenstein,"" he said of Posada.  Posada always publicly denied involvement in the bombing of the bombing of a Cuban airliner that had taken off from Barbados, the deadliest in-flight explosion until the 1988 Pan Am flight bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.  But in a 1998 New York Times interview, he took credit for the Havana bombings, which killed an Italian tourist, before later recanting.  When the AP asked about that interview and the bombings in 2009, Posada initially said he didn't hear or understand the Times' questions, then mentioned his lawyer, then stopped, laughed and shrugged.  Posada enjoyed an official and sometimes tumultuous relationship with the CIA until 1975. Yet throughout his years living in Latin America, he retained at least some contact with U.S. officials, culminating in the 2011 trial and acquittal. He returned to a hero's welcome in Miami's Cuban community.  Born in Cienfuegos, Cuba, in 1928, Posada studied chemistry at the University of Havana, and briefly worked for the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Following the Castro forces' final triumph in the Cuban Revolution on New Year's Day 1959, he joined the political opposition and was imprisoned briefly. He fled to Mexico and eventually the U.S. in 1961.  Other members of his family, including his brother and sister, remained in Cuba and he continued to send them money throughout his life through friends and other emissaries.  Several years after arriving in the U.S., he divorced his first wife and married Elina Nieves, with whom he had a son and a daughter. The lived apart for much of their marriage, but in his later years, Posada boasted that Nieves still did his laundry.  Posada trained for but never participated in the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba organized by the CIA. Through that experience, he became lifelong friends with the late Cuban exile and political kingmaker Jorge Mas Canosa, a reported benefactor and with whom he graduated from the U.S. Army's officer training school at Fort Benning, Georgia.  Posada claimed on a number of occasions Mas Canosa helped support him financially.  Early on, Posada's CIA handlers described him as reliable and even a reasonable voice among the exiles, whom he was willing to inform on, according to declassified agency documents released at the request of the National Security Archives.  ""A15 is not a typical kind of 'boom and bang' individual,"" CIA handler Grover Lythcott wrote in 1966, using a code name for Posada. ""He is acutely aware of the international implications of ill-planned or overly enthusiastic activities against Cuba.""  The agency has refused to declassify many documents related to Posada, but official summaries of those documents released to the Archive, show U.S. officials were particularly concerned about Posada's relationship with the mafia-linked casino operator Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal.  Another summary shows the agency was also concerned he'd taken CIA explosives and other items with him when in 1967 he took a job with Venezuela's state security agency, which he later headed.  He was running his own security firm in Venezuela by the time he was accused of coordinating the 1976 bombing of the Cuban airliner that exploded over the Caribbean shortly after taking off from Barbados. Posada was arrested when two men who worked for his small firm confessed to planting the bombs.  Posada Ã¢â‚¬â€ who still had strong ties to the then-Venezuelan government Ã¢â‚¬â€ was acquitted by a military court. He later escaped from jail dressed as a priest while awaiting a second trial in a civilian court.  He made his way to El Salvador, where he helped the Reagan administration and U.S. Army Col. Oliver North resupply neighboring Nicaragua's rightist Contra rebels against the left-leaning Sandinista government.  Posada flew beneath the radar for years Ã¢â‚¬â€ moving to Guatemala, where he survived a 1990 assassination attempt that left his face and body bullet-scarred and permanently damaged his speech.  Then in 2004, he was convicted in Panama in connection with a failed assassination attempt against Castro. While in prison, Posada became a prolific painter. His subjects ranged from Cuban revolutionary leader and poet Jose Marti to Mother Teresa and then Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, who pardoned him in 2005 at the behest of several Cuban-American lawmakers from South Florida.  Posada resurfaced in Miami in 2005. Two months later, he was arrested, following international pressure on the George W. Bush administration to hold him to the same standard as other accused terrorists.  The U.S. refused to turn him over to Venezuela or Cuba, citing fears he might face torture, nor did it ever try him directly on any terrorist charges, just the immigration charges.  Opinions were as widely split over the verdict as they were over Posada himself. Some believed the trial was too little too late, others thought it was a politically motivated case against an aging patriot, while still others saw the acquittal, which came after three hours of deliberation, as a travesty of justice.  He is survived by his wife and two adult children.",en,terrorattack,,

A recently published study by researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School found that 20 patients who suffer from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), saw significant improvements in their condition after being administered small doses of the drug over four months, in a clinical trial. The disease is estimated to afflict more than 30 per cent of Singaporeans.  While there is still a long way to go before this treatment option can be used to treat patients here, researchers are confident that it holds promise for those suffering from the disease.  NAFLD is caused by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver which is not attributed to heavy drinking. If left untreated over time, an estimated 4 per cent of patients can ultimately suffer from scarring of the liver, which can result in liver failure and cancer.  But the only way to treat the disease currently is through lifestyle changes, said Dr Eveline Bruinstroop, a research fellow at Duke-NUS who worked on the study. Patients are usually advised to reduce their consumption of sweet beverages and food with high calories, and exercise for 50 minutes, three times a week, a strict regime that many find hard to stick to, she said.  With rising obesity levels, more Singaporeans are at risk of getting the disease. A study published by SingHealth doctors last year suggested that there is a rise in incidence of the disease in Singapore.  Researchers from Duke-NUS had previously found that thyroid hormones can reduce fat content in rats' livers. The drug is currently used to treat conditions such as hypothyroidism, which causes symptoms such as a lack of energy and depression.  Working in conjunction with the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, the researchers reached out to six hospitals across Singapore to recruit patients for the study.  But since the study's conceptualisation in 2011, they have faced significant challenges in landing sufficient funding for it, said Associate Professor Teoh Yee Leong, the chief executive of SCRI, which spearheaded fundraising and coordination efforts for the clinical trial. Compared with big pharmaceutical firms, which can fund million-dollar studies over one or two years, the researchers could raise only $380,000 to fund their research, said Prof Teoh.  ""It is like preparing a Michelin star standard meal inside your own family kitchen,"" he said.  But despite the difficulties, the researchers plan to push on, and raise more funding to conduct a more extensive clinical study.  ""Such challenges push us to maximise our resources, and work much harder to make our study better,"" said Prof Teoh.",en,diseas,,

World Health Organization (WHO) workers prepare a centre for vaccination during the launch of a campaign aimed at beating an outbreak of Ebola in the port city of Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of Congo May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Kenny Katombe  Two patients left the hospital on Monday, said Henry Gray, head of the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) mission in the city, before being located the following day.  The World Health OrganizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (WHO) representative in Congo, Yokouide Allarangar, said one was found dead and another was sent back to hospital and died shortly afterwards.  Allarangar, speaking to reporters in the capital Kinshasa, said the two patients had left the hospital with the help of family members before heading to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“place of prayerÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Health Ministry sources, who asked not to be named, said two police officers had been deployed to help track them down.  Another patient left on Saturday, but was found alive the same day and is under observation, he said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is a hospital. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a prison. We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lock everything,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said health workers had redoubled efforts to trace contacts with the patients. Health workers have drawn up a list of 628 people who have had contact with known cases who will need to be vaccinated.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is unfortunate but not unexpected,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.

The river runs along the border with the Republic of Congo.  Allarangar said health officials received an alert on Wednesday from KinshasaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main hospital about a patient and had dispatched a team to investigate. However, he said this was not yet considered a suspected Ebola case and two or three other such alerts had turned out to be false alarms.  The outbreak, first spotted near the town of Bikoro, about 100 km (60 miles) south of the city, is believed to have killed at least 27 people so far.  The WHO said health workers were following up on three separate transmission chains for cases in MbandakaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wangata neighborhood - one linked to a funeral, one to a church and another to a rural health facility.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really the detective work of epidemiology that will make or break the response to this outbreak,Ã¢â‚¬Â Salama said.  The disease was first discovered in Congo in the 1970s. It is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person, who suffers severe bouts of vomiting and diarrhea.  More than 11,300 people died in an Ebola outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016.

Presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna, a study of more than 18,000 sick people in Denmark showed that the overweight and obese were twice as likely to survive hospitalisation for an infectious disease.  Overweight patients, researchers said, ""were 40 per cent less likely to die, and those who were obese 50 per cent less likely to die, than those of normal weight"".  The team had looked at hospital admissions from 2011 to 2015 for their study, which has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.  Earlier this week, other researchers at the conference projected that a quarter of the global population will be obese by 2045, and warned of a mounting medical bill.  Obesity has been linked to a higher risk of developing heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain cancers, but has been suggested to be protective for specific conditions - the so-called ""obesity paradox"".  Another paper presented at the conference on Friday said obese and overweight people hospitalised with pneumonia were 20-30 per cent less likely to die than patients of normal weight.  This study looked at records for almost 1.7 million pneumonia cases treated at over 1,000 United States hospitals in 2013 and 2014.  ""Compared with normal weight patients without use of a ventilator (less serious cases), overweight patients were 23 per cent more likely to survive and obese patients 29 per cent more likely to survive,"" said a statement.  Among people requiring a ventilator, the comparative numbers were 21 per cent and 30 per cent.  A person with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more is considered overweight, and 30 or higher obese.  A healthy BMI ranges from 18.5 to 24.9.  A third congress paper, based on data from 3.7 million admissions for sepsis at 1,000 American hospitals, also found that overweight and obese patients were less likely to die than people of normal weight.  Sepsis is a life-threatening condition in which the body is attacked by its own immune system.  Further evidence of an apparent survival benefit came from a fourth study, from the Netherlands, which showed that seriously ill obese patients have lower rates of muscle wasting in hospital.",en,diseas,,
1679567,channelnewsasia,None,VA health systems vary widely in heart disease death rates,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/va-health-systems-vary-widely-in-heart-disease-death-rates-10279590,,26/5/2018 3:20,"(Reuters Health) - Heart disease death rates vary substantially at Veterans Affairs hospitals nationwide, and a new study suggests that this holds true not just for hospitalized patients but also for outpatients.  Previous research has long documented differences in death rates at hospitals across the U.S., not just at VA facilities, often focusing on deaths among hospitalized patients or within a month after discharge. The current study, however, offers fresh insight by looking at combined mortality rates for inpatient and outpatient care.  Advertisement  Researchers studied 930,079 veterans with heart disease and 348,015 with congestive heart failure who received care at 138 VA health systems nationwide from 2010 to 2014.  At the various locations, annual death rates for heart disease ranged from a low of 5.5 percent to a high of 9.4 percent, while mortality rates for congestive heart failure ranged from 11.1 percent to 18.9 percent, researchers calculated.  ""The quality of care for chronic heart disease may differ across hospitals, thus some hospitals may be better at providing continuity care to patients with chronic heart disease,"" said lead study author Dr. Peter Groeneveld of the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  ""There are also numerous evidence-based therapies that have been shown to reduce heart failure mortality, but the use of these therapies varies widely,"" Groeneveld said by email.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The study wasn't designed to prove how care provided at specific hospitals and clinics might directly contribute to mortality rates.  However, the variation in mortality rates at VA hospitals likely mirrors what's would be seen at other hospitals and health systems, Groeneveld added. And some differences in patient populations that weren't possible to measure in the study- like disease severity, frailty, dementia or socioeconomic status - might have influenced death rates, he said.  Millions of Americans have what's known as ischemic heart disease, one of the two conditions examined in the study. It is caused by narrowed arteries that restrict blood flow to the heart and can ultimately lead to a heart attack.  Congestive heart failure is also common. It happens when the heart muscle weakens and doesn't pump blood as well as it should, and can be caused by narrowed arteries as well as by high blood pressure.  Patients with heart disease and congestive heart failure usually need regular clinic visits to monitor their blood pressure and assess other factors related to heart disease like cholesterol, weight, and smoking and drinking habits. Regular outpatient care can help improve patients' quality of life and minimize their risk of hospitalization or death.  More than four in five patients in the study had high blood pressure, researchers report in JAMA Cardiology.  About half of them had diabetes, which can damage blood vessels and contribute to worse symptoms for people with heart disease or heart failure.  These patients with multiple chronic health problems have a high risk of serious complications and death. It's not clear from the study results how much hospitals and clinics can control mortality rates, said, Dr. Paul Heidenreich of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System and Stanford University School of Medicine in California.  ""Some of the difference in mortality may be due to differences in patients for which we can't control (because we don't have data systems to track them) and some may be due to differences in quality of care,"" Heidenreich, author of an accompanying editorial, said by email.  ""The study adds to this knowledge by showing that this variation in mortality is present for outpatients as well and extends well beyond 30 days (after patients leave the hospital),"" Heidenreich added. ""If the variation is due to differences in care, then knowing these differences will matter to patients and be important for the health care system to address.""

The groups say around 120,000 people have been displaced by the Russian-backed Syrian regime's offensive to take Daraa province. Syria is wresting control from the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, as well as terror groups ISIS and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.  Syrians displaced by a government offensive near the town of Shayyah head toward the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Thursday.  Jordan and Israel are providing aid to the displaced but are refusing to allow Syrian refugees inside their countries. Jordan is already hosting 1.3 million Syrian refugees but closed its borders in 2016 after an ISIS suicide attack killed six of its border guards. The attack happened at a displacement camp in a demilitarized zone between Syria and Jordan. Israel does not typically take in Syrian refugees, except to give them medical treatment.  Airstrikes continued Friday, a day after 55 civilians and 10 fighters were killed in aerial bombardment and shelling, according to the local Daraa Martyrs Documentation Office monitoring. Sixteen children were among the dead on Thursday. The Syrian government said civilians were also fleeing armed opposition groups.  The White Helmets volunteer rescue group said Thursday was the deadliest day since the operation launched on June 19. The Daraa Martyrs Documentation Office has recorded 198 deaths in the whole operation.  Read More",en,terrorattack,,

The attack highlighted the brazenness of the extremist threat in a part of the world that made headlines in October with the killing of four U.S. service members in an ambush in neighboring Niger.  Force commander Gen. Didier Dacko confirmed Friday's attack by phone from Niger, saying it began with the car attack. Residents said the blast shook the community of Sevare, near the central city of Mopti.  In addition to the deaths two other attackers were captured, G5 Sahel spokesman Abdoul Salam Diagana told the AP. Four soldiers, three suspected attackers and a civilian were wounded, said Dr. Djibril Kassogue with the Sevare Hospital. ""The lives of those injured are not in danger,"" he said.  The chairman of the G5 Sahel, Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou, confirmed the death toll of three, including two military and one civilian, along with the eight injured.  In a statement from the G5 Force, Issoufou condemned ""this cowardly act by criminal organizations whose aim is to destabilize one of the essential instruments for the stability of our subregion, in this case the Joint Force of the G5 Sahel.""  He lauded the effective response of soldiers, and expressed solidarity with the families of the victims.  In the statement, he also reaffirmed ""the determination of the G5 Sahel member countries to fight the terrorist forces with firmness in order to restore the usual tranquility and serenity in which the people of the Sahel live.""  This is the first time the G5 Sahel headquarters has been targeted. The assault comes shortly before French President Emmanuel Macron and African leaders meet at an African Union summit starting Sunday in Mauritania, with the regional extremist threat on the agenda.  There was no immediate information on the attackers' identity. A number of extremist groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group are active in Mali, often targeting local security forces and the world's deadliest active U.N. peacekeeping mission. They also have staged high-profile attacks in the capitals of Mali and Burkina Faso, including simultaneous assaults on the French Embassy and army headquarters in Burkina Faso's capital in March.  The 5,000-strong G5 Sahel force launched last year and includes Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger and Mauritania. It has received millions of dollars in backing from the United States, European Union, Saudi Arabia and others.  The new force joins multiple counterterror efforts in the region including France's largest overseas military operation, Barkhane.  ___  Follow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa",en,terrorattack,,

AMMAN/BEIRUT: A string of Syrian rebel-held towns and villages accepted government rule on Saturday as insurgent lines collapsed in parts of the southwest under an intense bombardment that the United Nations says has forced 160,000 people to flee.  The southwest was an early hotbed of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad and defeat there would leave rebels with just one remaining stronghold - the area around Idlib province bordering Turkey in the northwest.  Advertisement  Rebels met Russian negotiators on Saturday to seek peace terms for Deraa province, where most of their southwest territory is located, but said these failed. Moscow is Assad's strongest ally and its air power since 2015 has been crucial to his recapture of vast swathes of Syria.  Local groups in many towns seized by the army in recent days had negotiated their own surrender deals independently of the main rebel operations rooms after heavy air raids.  State television broadcast footage from inside the towns of Dael and al-Ghariya al-Gharbiya, where people were shown chanting pro-Assad slogans. A war monitor and a military media unit run by the government's ally Hezbollah said numerous other towns and villages had agreed to come back under Assad's rule.  Fierce battles were still roiling the area around Deraa city, near the Jordanian border, where the army was trying to capture a disused air base, rebels said, and the northwestern chunk of Deraa province remains in opposition hands.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Air raids meanwhile intensified, said the monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, as displaced people flocked to the border areas least likely to be hit and the United Nations warned about a humanitarian catastrophe.  After the peace talks failed on Saturday, warplanes launched a new wave of strikes on the rebel-held towns of Bosra al-Sham, al-Nuaima and other areas, the Observatory reported, causing deaths, injuries and damage.  The army's offensive follows the capitulation of rebel enclaves near Homs and Damascus, including eastern Ghouta, which was recaptured after a scorched-earth assault that killed over a thousand civilians and laid waste to several towns.  Warfare in the southwest could risk a further escalation because of its proximity to Israel. The Israelis have already targeted Iran-backed militias fighting on Assad's side, which they have vowed to keep far from their country's borders.  The government's offensive so far has focussed on Deraa province, which borders Jordan, but not Quneitra province abutting the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  The entire southwest is part of a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed last year by Russia, the United States and Jordan. Despite Washington's threats that it would respond to breaches of that arrangement, it has shown no sign of doing so, and the opposition's top negotiator on Thursday accused it of having struck a ""malicious deal"" to stay silent.  NEGOTIATIONS  Insurgent negotiators had held meetings with Russia to try to agree a deal for all of Deraa province to come back under government sovereignty, but without the army or police entering the area.  The talks in the town of Bosra al-Sham, whose Roman citadel is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site, collapsed on Saturday, however, as the insurgents rejected Russia's proposed terms for their surrender, a rebel spokesman said.  Jordan has been facilitating talks between rebel factions and Moscow over a deal that would end the violence in exchange for the return of state rule in Deraa province on its border.  Russian negotiators have demanded rebels accept terms like those agreed for eastern Ghouta, where insurgents either left for opposition territory in the northwest along with their families or accepted the return of state rule, Jabawi said.  The southwest rebels did not accept this, and were instead proposing the return of civilian state institutions in the opposition areas and the entry of Russian military police rather than Syrian government forces.  The army has already captured large parts of the eastern zone of rebel-held territory in Deraa province less than two weeks into its offensive, however.  In eastern parts of Deraa, the army took control of al-Ghariya al-Sharqiya and al-Ghariya al-Gharbiya and Um Walad, after taking al-Harak, Busra al-Harir and surrounding areas in recent days.  In western parts of Deraa, the army has regained control over the towns of Dael and Ibta. There were contradictory reports over whether it had also gained the areas of al-Musayfra and Kuheil in eastern Deraa, and Tafas, al-Muzairib and Sheikh Saad in western Deraa.  The Observatory reported that warplanes carried out 32 air strikes overnight as the offensive continued, hitting nine towns in Deraa province. So far, about 100 civilians have been killed in air raids and shelling since June 19, it said.

Friday's attack was carried out by a bomber in a vehicle painted in UN colours who destroyed the building's entrance wall.  Advertisement  It was the first attack on the headquarters of the G5 force, set up with the backing of France in 2017 to roll back militant insurgents and criminal groups in the vast, unstable Sahel region.  The Al-Qaeda-linked Support Group for Islam and Muslims, the main militant alliance in Africa's Sahel region, claimed the attack in a telephone call to the Mauritanian news agency Al-Akhbar.  ""The conditions of this force will improve,"" Mauritanian Foreign Minister Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed said.  ""This shows our determination rather than an indication of any weakness.""  Advertisement  Advertisement  French President Emmanuel Macron and his Cameroonian counterpart Paul Biya on Friday condemned the attack and discussed the security situation in the Lake Chad area, the French leader's office said Saturday.  The strike came three days before a meeting in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott between Macron and the heads of the G5 Sahel states to discuss progress made by the force.  FOUR SUSPECTS ARRESTED  The G5 Sahel aims to have a total of 5,000 troops from five nations - Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger - but has faced funding problems.  It operates alongside France's 4,000 troops in the troubled ""tri-border"" area where Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso meet, and alongside the UN's 12,000-strong MINUSMA peacekeeping operation in Mali.  In a telephone call on Friday, Macron and Biya discussed ""the need to continue with regional cooperation in the fight against terrorist acts by the Boko Haram group,"" the French statement said.  The strike in the Malian town of Sevare came shortly after Friday prayers, a military source in the G5 Sahel force told AFP.  Governor Sidi Alassane Toure said four suspects had been arrested.  Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, in Sevare on Saturday, promised to ""hunt down the terrorists"" who carried out the attack, assuring it will not ""deflect us from our objective.""  UN secretary general Antonio Guterres condemned ""the complex attack perpetrated against the G5-Sahel Joint Force's Headquarters"", his spokesman said.  Guterres, who visited the Sevare headquarters last month, highlighted security shortcomings on several of the force's sites in Mali in a report published in May.  ""Poor conditions on and around the site represent an important security threat, and are delaying the deployment of the remaining soldiers,"" the report said.  'HUGE BLAST'  Residents in Sevare, 600 kilometres (375 miles) northeast of the capital Bamako, hid inside their homes during the attack, according to Bouba Bathily, a trader who sheltered from the gunfire in his house.  A local orange seller, Haoussa Haidara, said ""there was a huge blast"" followed by shooting that lasted more than an hour.  The G5 Sahel was scheduled to be fully mobilised by mid-2018, but its deployment has faced delays, equipment worries and accusations of human rights abuses.  On Tuesday, the UN said Malian soldiers within the force had ""summarily"" executed 12 civilians in a market in central Mali in May in retaliation for the death of a soldier.  France intervened militarily in Mali in 2013 to help government forces drive Al-Qaeda-linked militants out of the north.  But large tracts of the country remain lawless despite a peace accord signed with ethnic Tuareg leaders in mid-2015 aimed at isolating the militants.  The violence has also spilled over into both Burkina Faso and Niger.",en,terrorattack,,

AMMAN/BEIRUT: A major insurgent-held town in southwestern Syria has accepted the return of President Bashar al-Assad's rule, pro-government media and a war monitor said on Sunday, though some local activists and rebels disputed a deal had been completed.  Losing Bosra al-Sham, a major town near the provincial capital of Deraa, would be a significant loss for the opposition in the teeth of a Russian-backed Syrian army offensive in the southwest that has taken chunks of rebel territory.  Advertisement  Jordan on Sunday mediated a new round of talks between rebels in the southwest and Assad's main ally Russia, seeking a wider truce in the area to avert more bloodshed and another wave of displaced people near its border.  Russia has played a critical role in supporting Assad's two-week offensive with air power and negotiating local deals initially overseen by its military police.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a state television correspondent and media run by Assad's Lebanese ally Hezbollah said insurgents in Bosra al-Sham, east of the provincial capital Deraa had agreed a deal and were handing over heavy weapons.  Activists distributed footage of armoured vehicles being handed to Russian troops, though some local sources said it was a goodwill gesture as talks went on, rather than a sign that a surrender deal was being implemented.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Diplomatic sources said the wider negotiations were difficult, with Russia insisting on sweeping surrender terms, and rebels seeking an agreement that would make Jordan a guarantor of the safety of Deraa province's 800,000 civilians.  The United Nations said on Friday at least 160,000 people had already fled their homes.  Opposition officials involved in steering the rebel negotiating team said continued air strikes during the talks had undermined trust in the process.  Fighting and bombardment on Sunday initially focused on the area around Tafas, northwest of Deraa, along with heavy air attacks, but later involved clashes in the area between Deraa and Bosra al-Sham, the Observatory said.  Assad's offensive in the southwest aims to reclaim one of two remaining rebel strongholds in Syria, the other being Idlib and adjacent areas in the northwest. Assad's forces captured the last enclaves near Damascus and Homs earlier this year.  Southwest Syria is a ""de-escalation zone"" of reduced warfare and bombardment agreed by Russia, Jordan and the United States last year. Washington warned it would respond to violations of this agreement, but has done nothing so far. Last week, rebels said the United States had told them not to expect any American military support.  The opposition's chief negotiator in wider U.N. peace talks, Nasr al-Hariri, last week accused the United States of complicity in Assad's southwest offensive, saying American silence could only be explained by ""a malicious deal"".  A military media unit run by the government's Lebanese ally Hezbollah, a Syrian state television correspondent and the Observatory said rebels in Bosra al-Sham had started to hand over their weapons.  Bosra al-Sham, whose black-rock Roman citadel and theatre are a UNESCO World Heritage site, was captured by rebels in 2015.  REFUGE  Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the kingdom was engaged in intensive diplomacy with all parties in the conflict to help broker a ceasefire that would ease the plight of displaced civilians.  ""We are moving in all directions and with all the parties to bring a ceasefire and protect civilians,"" he said on Twitter on Saturday.  ""The Russian insistence on attempting to impose conditions, their unreadiness to stop the air strikes during negotiations, all this gives us more reason for lack of trust and justified fear,"" said Adnan Masalmeh, a coordinator of an opposition committee steering the negotiators.  Air strikes have pounded the region since the offensive ramped up two weeks ago, causing at least 160,000 people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.  On Saturday at least 10 civilians were killed when bombs were dropped on the rebel-held village of Ghasam, relief workers said. The Observatory says more than 100 civilians have been killed since an escalation in fighting on June 19.  Many who fled have sought refuge along the borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Both Jordan, which already hosts more than half a million Syrian refugees, and Israel, have said their borders will stay shut.  Both countries' militaries have distributed aid supplies to people seeking shelter near the borders.  On Sunday, Israel also said it had deployed more tanks and artillery to the Syrian front as a precaution because of the fighting there.  An Israeli army commander told Reuters it was hard to quantify how many people had sought shelter in the area immediately across the border, but that it was in the thousands and there were hundreds more arriving each day.  Southwest Syria was an early hotbed of the uprising against Assad in 2011 that morphed into the seven-year conflict that has cost over half a million lives and pushed half the country's pre-war population from their homes.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Stephen Anthony said Demetrius Pitts, also known as Abdur Raheem Rahfeeq, was arrested at 10 a.m. Sunday by the joint terrorism task force. Authorities were initially notified about Pitts in 2017, when he lived in Cincinnati and allegedly made statements supporting Al Qaeda and advocating violence against U.S. military members.  ""This case illustrated that law enforcement can not sit back and wait for Mr. Pitts to commit a violent act,"" Anthony said.  Authorities said Pitts made Facebook posts with ""disturbing"" messages, saying ""We as Muslims need to start training like this every day. We need to know how to shoot guns, throw grenades, hand to hand combat,"" Anthony said during a news conference.  After moving to Cleveland, authorities said Pitts continued to express his ""radical ideology."" During a meeting last week with an undercover FBI agent, Anthony said Pitts noted ""their holiday is coming up.""  ""What would hit them at their core? Blow up in the, have a bomb blow up in the 4th of July parade,"" he said.  In the last week, Pitts then went downtown to conduct reconnaissance at Voinovich Bicentennial Park and the Coast Guard station, among other locations, according to officials. He also continued to voice hatred for the military, saying he wanted to ""chop off heads and hands.""  U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman said Pitts planned to use a van packed with explosives to take places such as St. JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cathedral Ã¢â‚¬Å“off the map.Ã¢â‚¬Â  ""He wanted to target people watching fireworks and watching the Fourth of July parade downtown,"" he told reporters.  VIRGINIA POLICE ARREST 2, ACCUSING THEM OF TRYING TO COMMIT ACT OF TERROR AT A PROM  Besides the alleged plan to attack on July 4, officials said Pitts wanted to also harm military members and families of service members. Herdman said Pitts discussed giving remote control cars packed with shrapnel to children of military members. When he was asked by the undercover FBI agent if he was worried about injuring children, Pitts said, ""I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care and I have no regrets,"" according to Herdman.  In recent weeks, Pitts also talked about wanting to travel to Philadelphia, and told the undercover agent Sunday he wanted to conduct reconnaissance for a future attack using a truck packed with explosives, similar to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, authorities said in the criminal complaint.  Anthony said the arrest came after multiple conversations showed that Pitts had a desire to do harm. Pitts was born and ""radicalized"" in the U.S., and wanted to commit violence in the name of Al Qaeda, he added. Pitts faces up to 20 years in prison.  Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said while the alleged plot was foiled, the public should still contact authorities if they notice anything suspicious.

1729442,aljazeera,Marwan Kabalan About The Author Marwan Kabalan Is The Director Of Policy Analysis At The Arab Centre,Iran's Syria predicament,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/iran-syria-predicament-180703134308836.html,,5/7/2018 0:13,"As Syria's civil war draws to a close, Iran's activity in the country is coming under increasing scrutiny. The US, Israel, and the Gulf states are all working towards making Iran's military presence in Syria untenable and its withdrawal - a prerequisite for resolving the conflict.  The Trump administration is not as tolerant of Iran's regional ambitions as its predecessor. The Pentagon has maintained US military presence in Syria after the defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISIL) and the Levant in order to stop Iran from establishing a land corridor from Iraq to Lebanon, through Syrian territories.  Over the past year, the US-led coalition has succeeded in preventing Iranian-backed militias from establishing a foothold on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River, near the border with Iraq.  The US has also blocked these militias from advancing towards al-Tanf border crossing between Syria and Iraq near the Jordanian border, where it maintains a military presence to monitor Iranian movement on the main road between Baghdad and Damascus.  Over the past year, there has been a shift in Israel's Syria policy, too. From the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011 to mid-2017, Israel had a hands-off policy, which worked in Iran's favour.  During this period, Israel tolerated Iranian military presence in Syria, as its main objective was to help sustain the Syrian regime and prevent an opposition victory. Israel did not perceive the Syrian conflict as a threat, as it weakened its foes on both sides of the divide.  Last year, however, Israel's policy shifted in response to a new Iranian strategy in Syria. Since the beginning of the conflict, Iran's primary objective was to defend Assad.  Yet last year, as it became clear that Assad was winning the war, it started to work towards establishing a permanent military presence in Syria to challenge Israel. Iran's end game was to set up paramilitary forces independent from the Syrian government and loyal to Tehran - similar to Hezbollah in Lebanon. That posed a direct threat to Israeli interests.  In July 2017, Israel tried to insert a clause in a de-escalation agreement between the US, Jordan and Russia to keep Iranian forces at least 40km away from the occupied Golan Heights, but failed. As a result, it decided to take the issue into its own hands. Since early 2018, the Israeli air force has intensified strikes against Iranian bases and outposts across Syria.  Russia is undoubtedly alarmed by the escalation of tensions, but it also views it as an opportunity. A confrontation between the two regional foes in Syria could undermine its strategy aimed at ensuring the survival of the Assad regime, rebuilding the Syrian army and resurrecting the state bureaucracy and the security apparatuses. But Moscow could also use the Israeli pressure as leverage against Tehran to force it to fall in line with its Syria policy.  The Syrian government's onslaught on Deraa backed by Russian forces showed that the Russians and the Israelis have already identified some common interests in southwest Syria.  According to the Washington Post, an agreement has been reached to keep Iran away from the Golan Heights in exchange for allowing the Syrian regime to regain control over the opposition-held territories in the southwest.  The Russians seem willing to go even further. They want to strike a broader deal with the Trump administration to trade US military presence in Syria with that of Iran. That would include the US pulling its troops out of the Kurdish-held Syrian territories east of the Euphrates and from the al-Tanf base in the southeast of the country.  This option seems to have been discussed during the June 27 visit of US National Security Adviser John Bolton to Moscow and it is likely to be finalised at the upcoming Helsinki summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  If such a deal is made, it would make almost everyone happy, except Iran. It would please the Israelis, the Gulf states, the Assad regime, the Americans and, indeed, the Russians, who have emerged as the biggest winners in the Syrian civil conflict.  {articleGUID}  It was Iran that invited Russia in 2015 to help ensure the survival of the Syrian regime after it failed to stop the advances of the opposition. The Russians answered the call and rescued the Assad regime, but they seem to be planning to throw the Iranians under the bus at the earliest opportunity.  In recent months, the Iranians have become increasingly wary of Russia's policies in Syria and elsewhere. They complain that the Russians are doing nothing to stop the movement of the Israeli air force over Syria despite having anti-aircraft missile systems stationed in the country, including the S-400. This has led some to believe that Russia condones Israel's actions against Iran in Syria.  The Russians also took an ambivalent position when Trump decided to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal.  Russia's acting deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, even suggested that Iran should make some concessions to save the deal. To add insult to injury, Russia sided with Saudi Arabia - Iran's arch enemy - when the increase of oil production to restrain prices was discussed.  Before OPEC's latest meeting, Russia pressured Iran to drop its reservations on the issue. It is very likely that Russia and Saudi Arabia are planning to compensate for any shortages in the oil market that may arise as a result of the US sanctions against Iran which will take effect in August.  Over the past seven years, Iran has invested heavily in Syria. It threw its weight behind the Assad regime, providing both financial and military support. Hundreds of Iranian Revolutionary Guards - Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and intelligence personnel have been killed in Syria.  According to the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, Iran spends $6bn annually to prop up Assad. To make a return on its investment, Iran was hoping to take on a sizable part of Syria's post-war reconstruction. All these investments are now at risk of being lost.  Indeed, Iran will do everything in its power to resist any attempt to be forced out of Syria, a very important asset in its geopolitical game. If it were to lose it, its grip on Iraq would also be weakened and its only direct land route to Lebanon, where its key ally Hezbollah is based, would be blocked.  This could cause Iran's entire Middle East project to collapse. According to one Iranian official, Syria is more important to Iran than its oil-rich southern province of Khuzestan.  Yet, Iran's options appear to be limited. It would find it very difficult to resist the emerging US-Russian-Arab-Israeli consensus on throwing its forces out of Syria to stabilise the war-torn country.  All in all, the Syrian civil war - a conflict that was once seen as Iran's greatest regional victory - may end up becoming its greatest regional failure in the near future.

The flight of families on Thursday followed a series of intensive ""earth shattering"" air strikes that targeted Deraa city in specific, and its surrounding areas including the towns of Nassib, Om Elmiathin, Saida, al-Shayah and Tafas, activists and medics told Al Jazeera.  ""The shelling doesn't spare anyone. They [regime forces] don't differentiate between civilians and military personnel, or between homes, mosques and hospitals,"" Amer Abazeid, a spokesperson for the Syria Civil Defence known as the White Helmets, told Al Jazeera from Deraa city.  ""Regime forces today used all kinds of weapons against these villages, including barrel bombs and surface-to-surface missiles,"" he said.  At least six civilians have been killed in Thursday's attacks, which began following a brief lull after negotiations between rebel factions and Russia broke down.  On June 19, Assad's forces, along with Russian military assistance, began their offensive in Deraa and neighbouring Quneitra province.  The civil defence team in Deraa say they are still working on tallying more deaths, Abazeid noted.  ""It has been increasingly challenging to do so without access to medical points,"" he explained.  Last month, Syria's air force targeted at least six hospitals and medical points across Deraa, making it challenging medics to treat and tally wounded civilians, and those who lose their lives.  Targeting refugee camps  It is estimated that air raids launched by the government have killed more than 175 people so far.  The United Nations say the lives of more than 750,000 civilians are in danger from the ongoing fighting between government forces and the opposition. Rebels are now mostly situated in towns in the eastern front, close to border areas.  Kareem al-Aswad, an activist in Deraa city, said Thursday's bombardment has led families to leave and gather in areas less than 1 kilometre away from the Jordanian border.  ""Air strikes targeted open spaces in towns that lay along the lines adjacent to border areas,"" al-Aswad told Al Jazeera from the outskirts of Deraa city.  ""These spaces aren't empty Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ They're refugee camps,"" he said.  ""They have in the past ten days become havens to displaced people who fled from different parts of Deraa,"" al-Aswad added, describing the sounds of the bombs as ""earth shattering"".  The 23-year-old said many of his family members were among those who chose to leave, but some have opted to stay hoping negotiations would end well this time around.  Following days of failed negotiations mediated by Jordan, which has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire, rebel factions and Russia are expected to resume talks on Friday.  Lack of supplies  Around 320,000 people have been displaced since the offensive began last month.  While 60,000 people are struck at the Nassib-Jaber border crossing overlooking Jordan, thousands more are now along the western border with the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.  But both Jordan and Israel say they will not be admitting refugees into their countries.  Mohammed Khalil and his family left Nassib for the border area 10 days ago.  The father of two, who was displaced twice before in the last several days, told Al Jazeera that thousands near the border were trying to cope under the soaring sun, without access to basic supplies.  ""Anyone here with a tent is considered lucky,"" he said from the area separating the border crossings of the two countries.  According to him, several deaths have occurred due to infections from snakebites, which are prominent in open desert areas. Without access to adequate medical equipment and antibiotics, many of these fatalities could not have been saved.  Khalil said he also witnessed a handful of deaths that were a result of polluted water consumption.  ""None of the international aid agencies are present here,"" he said of the largely 'unequipped' area.  Though some aid provided by Jordanian citizens had arrived on Wednesday, Khalil said these were barely enough for the tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - currently at the border area.  Khalil, 23, hopes to return to Nassib in the near future.  ""We don't want anything,"" he said. ""All we're asking for is a sense of lasting security and stability.""",en,terrorattack,,

More than 10 people were wounded and the death toll could rise, Col. Ahmed Mohamed said. Witnesses said some ministry staffers died or were injured while leaping from windows or walls in an effort to escape.  The attack began in the morning when a suicide car bomber detonated at the gate of the interior ministry, which is close to the presidential palace and the headquarters of parliament, police Capt. Mohamed Hussein told The Associated Press.  Three gunmen were believed to be holed up inside the ministry, Hussein said as shooting could be heard in the background. The compound also holds Somalia's security ministry.  Ambulance sirens echoed across the area as soldiers opened fire to disperse bystanders and motorists.  The Somalia-based al-Shabab, an arm of al-Qaida, often targets high-profile areas of the capital. It was blamed for the October truck bombing that killed more than 500 people in the deadliest attack in the country's history.  The ongoing threat from what has become the deadliest Islamic extremist group in sub-Saharan Africa has hurt efforts to strengthen Somalia's fragile government and stabilize the long-chaotic Horn of Africa nation.  The United States under the Trump administration has stepped up military efforts in Somalia, including dozens of drone strikes, against al-Shabab and a small presence of fighters linked to the Islamic State group. At least two U.S. military personnel have been killed.

Interior ministry officials were not immediately available to comment on the report.  Egypt in February launched a highly-publicized operation against Islamic State militants who have waged years of attacks on security forces and civilians, killing hundreds.  The death of the 11 brings the total of those killed since the beginning of the operation to at least 261 suspected militants, according to a Reuters count based on military statements.

Sisi's critics say his presidency has brought a harsh crackdown on dissent, but supporters say such measures are needed to stabilise Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that warning during a visit to Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin.  ""A few hours ago, a Syrian aircraft infiltrated Israel's airspace,"" he said. ""We intercepted it and we will continue to act decisively against any spillover and any infiltration of Israeli territory or airspace.""  There were no reports of injuries or damage over the drone's incursion.  Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said the drone was constantly monitored and that it traveled about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) inside Israeli territory. He said defensive measures were taken.  ""We scrambled four fighter jets that were on standby for similar missions as well as two attack helicopters,"" he said.  Conricus said that after the drone was destroyed by a single Patriot missile, its remains landed near the Sea of Galilee.  He added that military officials believe the drone was Syrian and that it could have been on an intelligence collecting mission, but it was not yet clear if it purposely entered Israel or strayed from its path. It had also flown over Jordan, he said.  The military issued a statement warning that it ""will not allow any violation of Israeli airspace and will act against any attempt to hurt its civilians.""  Last month, Israel fired a missile at a drone that approached its airspace near the Syrian frontier, and in February Israel shot down what it said was an Iranian drone that entered its airspace.

Syrian state media said the missiles targeted positions around Hader village in the southern province of Quneitra, near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  ""The aircraft of the Israeli enemy fired several missiles in the direction of some army positions,"" state media cited a military source as saying. Air defences thwarted the attack, which caused only material damages, it said.  Israel is alarmed by Iranian influence in Syria during the seven-year civil war, striking targets it describes as Iranian deployments or convoys of Hezbollah, a Lebanese movement backed by Tehran.  Israel has been on high alert as Syrian government forces advance on rebels near the Golan, which Israel took from Syria in the earlier 1967 Middle East war. Israel worries Assad could let his Iranian allies entrench there or that Syrian forces may defy a 1974 Golan demilitarisation.  With the help of heavy Russian air power, Syrian government forces seized swathes of the southern Deraa province from insurgents in the past three weeks. The offensive is expected to turn next to rebel parts of Quneitra, closer to the Golan.  The pro-Damascus newspaper al-Watan said on Thursday the army sent reinforcements to launch a ""broad military operation"" and bring all the province under state rule.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebel factions clashed with government forces overnight in Quneitra.  Earlier this week, state media said air defences struck an Israeli warplane and shot down missiles targeting the T4 air base in Homs province.

A prototype vaccine developed by pharmaceutical group Merck is already in use, but acts only against the most virulent, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ZaireÃ¢â‚¬Â strain.  Despite not having market approval, MerckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rVSV-ZEBOV was administered to people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in May, with UN approval, in a bid to contain an outbreak of the same virus that killed more than 11,300 in  three West African countries from 2013-2015, sparking international panic.  For several months, a team from the October 12 Hospital has been working with researchers at two other hospitals in the capital to examine and learn from blood samples taken from three people cured of Ebola in Spain.  Lead researcher Rafael Delgado told reporters the difficulty lay in the fact that the virus protects itself with proteins that act as a shield, and only exposes its vulnerable zones for short periods of time.  That makes it tough for the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immune system to fight the virus.  The three Spanish patients had produced Ã¢â‚¬Å“very effectiveÃ¢â‚¬Â viral antibodies, though in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“small quantityÃ¢â‚¬Â and only against the Zaire strain they were contaminated with.  Delgado, head of microbiology at the hospital, said researchers are aiming to reproduce these antibodies on a larger scale, and in a way that would make them efficient against all five virus strains.  US medical giant Johnson & Johnson is separately developing an experimental vaccine against two Ebola strains.  Delgado said researchers hope to get results from mouse experiments within a year.  The Ebola epidemic caused alarm in Spain in 2014 when a nursing assistant, Teresa Romero, became the first person infected outside Africa.

It is now revealed that Bahrum Naim, 34, an Indonesian Islamic State (IS) leader in Syria who was a master online recruiter and bomb-making instructor, was also behind the recruitment of at least 26 Malaysians into the terror group.    Advertisement  According to the Royal Malaysian Police intelligence agency, Special Branch, the 26 men belonged to a cell that plotted a series of terror attacks on churches, temples and entertainment spots in Johor, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bahrum recruited Malaysian citizens to go to Syria. The group was called Malhama Qubra,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Special Branch counter-terrorism division, told Channel NewsAsia.    Regional security sources told Channel NewsAsia earlier that Bahrum was killed in a US drone strike in Syria sometime before Ramadan.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He (Bahrum) also ordered the subjects (members) to launch attacks in Malaysia before going to Syria. The reason for that is to take revenge against the police for arresting supporters of Daesh,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ayob, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic acronym.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“They were also planning to attack (Hindu) temples in Johor and Klang Valley, a casino in Genting Highland and the Guinness Anchor factory in Selangor,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ayob.    Bahrum was known to have taught his recruits to assemble bombs by uploading bomb-making manuals on Telegram channels.    According to Ayob, the leader of Malhama Qubra learnt how to assemble crude bombs from BahrumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manuals.    Ã¢â‚¬Å“But we managed to foil and pre-empt their activities,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ayob.    Bahrum communicated constantly with the leader of Malhama Qubra who would then pass on his messages to other members, according to Ayob.    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bahrum communicated with Malhama QubraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader via Whatsapp, Facebook and Telegram as the applications were deemed as safe and an easy way to spread (IS propaganda) quickly and widely,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ayob.

The offensive on the city of Masaya came on the heels of a bloody siege of student protesters holed up in a church in the capital Managua on the weekend, suggesting Ortega was intensifying the use of lethal force to quell dissent. His government says it is carrying out a ""liberation"" of towns and cities where protesters have been active.  Police and masked paramilitary units toting assault rifles on Tuesday sealed off all roads leading to Masaya's flashpoint neighborhood of Monimbo, from which gunfire could be heard. Videos posted on social media showed rebels inside Monimbo firing back, some with homemade mortars.  The head of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, Vilma Nunez, said at least two people were killed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an adult woman and a police officer.  State media confirmed the death of the policeman but gave no other toll from the assault.  A group of journalists, including AFP, which tried to enter Monimbo to verify the situation were shot at by pro-government gunmen to prevent them approaching.  More than 1,000 men firing automatic weapons entered the city of 100,000 people early Tuesday, residents said.  ""They're attacking us from various entry points in Monimbo,"" Cristian Fajardo, a leader of a student protest movement, said in a WhatsApp message.  ""They're attacking Monimbo! The bullets are reaching the Maria Magdalena parish church, where the priest is sheltered,"" archbishop Silvio Baez wrote on Twitter.  (READ: Pope Francis calls for dialogue as Nicaragua violence escalates)  ""May Daniel Ortega stop the massacre! People of Monimbo I beg you, save yourselves!""  The US warned Ortega against pursuing the assault on Masaya. It called for a halt to the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests that has left some 280 people dead over the past three months.  ""We strongly urge President Ortega not to attack Masaya,"" tweeted Francisco Palmieri, the US principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Western hemisphere affairs.  ""Continued gov't-instigated violence and bloodshed in #Nicaragua must end immediately. The world is watching.""  'Terror message'  ""They are shooting at houses in an irresponsible way. The message is that anyone who pops their head out will be killed: it's a message of terror,"" said Alvaro Leiva, secretary of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Association (ANPDH).  The operation follows a violent week in Nicaragua in which students and opposition groups calling for Ortega's ouster came under attack several times amidst widespread civil action.  Ten days ago, at least 14 people died Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4 of them police or paramilitaries Ã¢â‚¬â€œ after a raid by pro-government forces in the areas of Diriamba and Jinotepe, near Masaya.  Last week, 5 people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4 of them police officers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ died in clashes between opposition supporters and police backed by paramilitaries in the southeast town of Morrito while another operation by Ortega loyalists ended with at least 10 dead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including 4 police Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on Sunday in Masaya.  On Monday, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged an end to the violence and a resumption of the stalled dialogue with the opposition.  In Brussels, Paul Oquist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nicaragua's minister for national policies and one of the cabinet members closest to Ortega Ã¢â‚¬â€œ told AFP in an interview on Tuesday that an attempted ""coup"" had been defeated.  ""That is very good news because what it leaves then is dialogue, because the coup plotters did not want dialogue,"" Oquist said.  'Clean-up operation'  The government launched its ""clean-up"" operation in Masaya this month in a bid to break through barriers of piled bricks and clear opposition activists from the streets.  The deadly clashes erupted on April 18, initially against a now-ditched pension reform.  That ignited long-simmering resentment against the veteran leader and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo.  The bloodshed caused business support for Ortega to evaporate, and the influential Catholic Church stepped in, attempting to mediate a peaceful solution.  The Vatican's representative in Nicaragua, Stanislaw Waldemar Sommertag, on Tuesday called for an immediate truce and a return to dialogue.  The opposition insists Ortega resign. It has called for elections scheduled for 2021 to be brought forward to next year.  A former guerrilla leader, Ortega has been in power since 2007 following an earlier 11-year span as leader after the 1979 overthrow of US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza.

That attacker, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri, hijacked a truck and murdered its Polish driver before killing another 11 people and wounding dozens more by ploughing the heavy vehicle through the festive market in central Berlin.  He was shot dead by Italian police in Milan four days later while on the run.  Germany has since been targeted again in attacks with radical Islamist motives.  In July 2017, a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum seeker wielding a knife stormed into a supermarket in the northern port city of Hamburg, killing one person and wounding six others before being detained by passers-by.  German prosecutors said the man likely had a ""radical Islamist"" motive.  IS also claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in 2016, including the murder of a teenager in Hamburg, a suicide bombing in the southern city of Ansbach that wounded 15, and an axe attack on a train in Bavaria that left five injured.  In June, German police said they foiled what would have been the first biological attack with the arrest of a Tunisian suspected militant in possession of the poison ricin and bomb-making material.  Germany remains a target for militant groups, in particular because of its involvement in the coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, and its deployment in Afghanistan since 2001.  Security services estimate there are around 11,000 Islamist radicals in Germany, some 980 of whom are deemed particularly dangerous and capable of using violence. Around 150 of these potentially dangerous individuals have been detained for various offences.  Chancellor Angela Merkel has allowed in more than one million asylum seekers since 2015 - a decision that has driven the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which charges that the influx spells a heightened security risk.",en,terrorattack,433,['Germany']

The operation was carried out on a intelligence tip off about the presence of an Islamic State (IS) operative identified as Hidayat Ullah in a house in Darenjo village of Qalat district in the restive province.

A senior FC official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP Ullah was facilitator of Hafeez Nawaz, who carried out the suicide bombing last week which killed at least 149 people.  The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack at an election rally in Balochistan's Mastung district.  Provincial authorities identified the bomber as Nawaz, a Pakistani national who stayed in Afghanistan and ""waged jihad"" against international troops before carrying out the suicide attack in Mastung.  Advertisement  Advertisement  A senior administration official in Mastung district Qaim Lashari also confirmed the Qalat raid.  ""Hidayat Ullah led a group of IS operatives, who are present in different areas of Balochistan, and we hope to track them down pretty soon,"" the official added.  News of Ullah's death coincided with a small explosion in Chaman district bordering Afghanistan which wounded four people.  The bomb planted on a motorbike apparently targeted an FC vehicle and went off seconds after it passed by.  Oil and gas-rich Balochistan is regularly hit by homegrown militancy and sectarian violence.  Violence in Pakistan has however dropped significantly since the country's deadliest-ever militant attack, an assault on a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar in 2014 that killed more than 150 people, most of them children.  Pakistan's military intensified operations against militants in the tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan in the wake of that attack, leading to dramatic security improvements.  But analysts have long warned that Pakistan is not tackling the root causes of extremism, and that militants retain the ability to carry out spectacular attacks like the Mastung blast.",en,terrorattack,,

Senior government officials, political leaders and supporters were leaving the airport after greeting the powerful ethnic Uzbek leader and former warlord when the explosion happened.  Advertisement  ""This is the first time I have seen a suicide attack,"" one witness told AFP.  ""People were collecting human flesh with their hands,"" he said, shaking as he spoke. ""What is going on in Afghanistan?""  Dostum, clad in a Western suit and sunglasses and travelling in an armoured vehicle, was unharmed, said his spokesman Bashir Ahmad Tayanj.  Kabul Police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said 14 people had been killed and 60 wounded, adding that nine members of the security forces and traffic police were among the dead.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack through its official Amaq news agency late Saturday, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group.  The suicide bomber was on foot, interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said, adding that civilians, including a child, and security force members were among the casualties.  Dostum, who is linked to a catalogue of human rights abuses in Afghanistan, was mobbed like a celebrity as he left the chartered plane from Turkey, where he has lived since May 2017.  His return, which has been the subject of much speculation, comes amid violent protests in several provinces across northern Afghanistan, his traditional power base.  Thousands of Dostum's supporters have taken to the streets in recent weeks, shuttering election and government offices and blocking sections of highways to demand the release of a pro-government militia leader and call for Dostum's return.  Expectations of the return did little to quell the unrest, with protesters vowing Sunday to continue demonstrating until the burly leader of the Uzbek ethnic minority tells them otherwise.  ""We don't trust the government. We will continue our protests unless General Dostum tells us to stop,"" Ehsanullah Qowanch, a protest leader in Faryab province, told AFP.  Qowanch also repeated calls for the release of Nezamuddin Qaisari - a district police chief and Dostum's provincial representative in Faryab - whose arrest earlier this month ignited the protests.  Another protester, Massoud Khan, said: ""We have been on the streets for 20 days now. We are not going to stop our protests unless our demands are met.""  'KNOWN KILLER'  Observers say President Ashraf Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, gave the green light for Dostum to come home to stabilise the north and secure Uzbek support before next year's presidential election, which he is widely expected to contest.  Dostum left Afghanistan in May 2017 after he was accused of organising the rape and torture of a political rival.  He had denied the allegations and said his departure was for medical check-ups and family reasons.  Ghani in 2009 described Dostum as a ""known killer"". Yet he chose him as his running mate in the 2014 presidential election, underlining the sometimes uncomfortable ethnic realities of Afghan politics.  Presidential spokesman Haroon Chakhansuri said Saturday that Dostum had been ""treated"" and would resume his duties upon his return.  Seven of Dostum's bodyguards have been convicted of the sexual assault and illegal imprisonment of Ahmad Ishchi, a former governor of the northern province of Jowzjan, in 2016.  Dostum allegedly had Ishchi abducted in Jowzjan and then kept him hostage in his private compound for several days, where the captive was said to have been tortured and sodomised.  Chakhansuri deflected questions about whether Dostum would face charges over the incident, saying ""the judiciary is an independent body, the government does not interfere in their decisions"".  Dostum is one of several controversial figures whom Kabul has sought to reintegrate into mainstream politics since the US-led invasion in 2001.  His heroic status in the north belies the barbarities for which he is known.  Dostum, who helped the United States oust the Taliban regime in 2001, allegedly allowed hundreds of Taliban prisoners to be suffocated in shipping containers.  ",en,terrorattack,436,['Kabul']

But this simple chore turned deadly on Sunday (Jul 22) when a blast in the street killed two of them and wounded another.  No one appears to have witnessed the explosion on the quiet, dusty street divided by a putrid open drain, but police told AFP they believe a magnetic bomb hidden in a pile of garbage had detonated after the children touched it.  Advertisement  It is a tragic scene played out across war-torn Afghanistan almost every day - children killed or maimed by explosive devices left over from decades of conflict, carelessly discarded or deliberately planted.  ""This is our life all around the city - it happens everywhere,"" a tearful Mahmood told AFP, as he stood with a dozen male mourners in a narrow dirt lane outside his house.  ""I was working as normal at the vegetable market, my children were throwing out the garbage and the bomb went off and they were killed.""  Mahmood, who has nine children, said his daughter Shabnam, 13, and his eight-year-old son Nisar died in the explosion.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Their small bodies were thrown several metres by the force of the blast, according to people who found them.  Another daughter, nine-year-old Rukhsar, was taken to the trauma facility run by Italian NGO Emergency where she underwent major surgery for multiple shrapnel wounds.  She was in critical but stable condition.  ""Some people said the bomb was hidden under the (shipping) container and others were saying it was in the garbage (on the ground). It is difficult to know,"" Mahmood said.  Behind the mud and brick wall of Mahmood's home in a poor area of Khair Khana neighbourhood came the sound of grieving women wailing.  Civilians, including children, have borne the brunt of the country's nearly 17-year conflict.  UN figures show 3,179 children were killed or wounded in 2017, accounting for almost one-third of the total civilian casualties for the year.  Improvised explosive devices, such as remotely detonated or pressure-plate bombs, killed or wounded 545 of them.  Unexploded ordnance claimed the lives of 142 children and wounded 376 in the same period.  ""Conflict-related violence continues to erode the rights of children to education, healthcare, freedom of movement and other fundamental rights, as well as family life, playing outdoors and simply enjoying a childhood free of the brutal effects of war,"" UNAMA's human rights chief Danielle Bell said in a report recently.  Mahmood said Shabnam and Nisar were ""calm and quiet children"" who spent most of their time indoors - not uncommon in Kabul where many parents make their children play inside for fear of violence.  ""My elder daughter ... never went out on her own, she always wanted to have the company of her brother,"" Mahmood said.  ""Today, sadly, they were killed.""",en,terrorattack,,

An explosion is pictured at Quneitra at the Syrian side of the Israeli Syrian border, as seen from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Israel July 22, 2018. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun  Islamic State-affiliated forces entrenched in the Yarmouk Basin, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Jordan, also repelled a ground attack by the Syrian army and its allies, the sources added.  The rural area has become the main battleground in the sensitive border region after a major Syrian army offensive backed by its Russian allies routed other rebel groups who were once supported by Washington, Jordan and Gulf states.  The Syrian army said its aerial strikes and shelling of militants in the Yarmouk Basin had killed Ã¢â‚¬Å“tens of terroristsÃ¢â‚¬Â in a campaign whose goal it said was to crush militants.  A senior Syrian army officer told Reuters heavy fighting with the militants was focusing on Tel Jamou Heights, a strategic area near the Yarmouk Basin where the hardline group was putting up tough resistance.  An intelligence source told Reuters 1,000-1,500 Islamic State fighters had been holding their ground despite the 10-day-old bombing campaign that he said had hit villages and caused an Ã¢â‚¬Å“untold numberÃ¢â‚¬Â of civilian casualties.  A former resident in touch with relatives said thousands of civilians had fled bombed villages to areas held by the army or the rebels.  An explosion is seen at Quneitra at the Syrian side of the Israeli Syrian border as it is seen from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Israel July 22, 2018. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun  Another source familiar with the situation said Islamic State had been able to expand its territory over the last 20 hours by seizing at least 18 villages abandoned by other rebels under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA).  ARMY PUSHES NEAR GOLAN FRONTIER  The Syrian army wants full control over Quneitra province, where Israel has deep concerns over the presence of Iranian-backed militias in the so-called Triangle of Death area.  The area is a bastion of Iranian-backed militias including Hezbollah, according to Western intelligence sources.  The Israeli government signalled it would not impede the Syrian army presence in Quneitra as long as Syrian forces steered away from a demilitarised zone along the border.  Israel also said it would continue to escalate attacks along its frontier and elsewhere in Syria where it suspects Iranian-backed forces are stationed.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are continuing to act in Syria to prevent Iranian entrenchment there.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Syrian state television said on Sunday an Israeli air strike had hit a military post in the city of Misyaf in SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hama province but caused only material damage.  Slideshow (5 Images)  It was the second suspected attack in a week by Israel on army installations that the Syrian opposition and Western intelligence sources say have an Iranian military presence.  SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army and its allies have been pushing to expand their foothold near the Golan frontier by negotiating surrender deals with rebel groups and allowing them to move to opposition-held areas in northern Syria.  On Sunday, the evacuation of hundreds of rebels and their families resumed for the third day from villages along the Golan frontier as part of a Russian-brokered surrender deal, sources said.  The deal brings the area back under government control and lets Syrian army brigades return to where they were stationed before SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seven-year-old conflict - posts near a 1974 demilitarized zone with Israel on the Golan frontier.  The opposition said the Syrian army were expected to be deployed in areas abandoned by rebels once the evacuations are completed and heavy weapons given up by rebels.  Russian military police have also entered rebel-held towns as part of guarantees given by the Russians that the army and its allied militias do not take revenge against civilians and former fighters, rebel officials said.  Separately, a source told Reuters on Sunday the unrest in the border area had disrupted efforts to evacuate hundreds of members of SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“White HelmetÃ¢â‚¬Â civil defence group over the Golan frontier into Jordan.  The plan, backed by Israel and Western powers, had meant to evacuate 800 people overnight, but only 422 made it because of the increased presence of Islamic State and government roadblocks, the source said.  RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military said it had also shot down two unidentified drones that attacked its air base at Hmeimim in northern Syria on Saturday and Sunday, Russian agencies reported.

Attahullah Khogyani, the provincial governor's spokesman, said three other people, including the mosque's religious leader, were wounded in the attack, which took place on Sunday evening in the district of Surkh Rod.  No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but both the Taliban and Islamic State militants are active in eastern Afghanistan, especially in Nangarhar province.  Earlier on Sunday, an Islamic State suicide bomber struck near Kabul's airport, killing 20 people and narrowly missing Afghanistan's vice president, who was returning home after living in Turkey for over a year.  Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former Uzbek warlord, and his entourage were unharmed, but more than 70 other people were wounded, according to Hashmat Stanekzai, spokesman for the Kabul's police chief.  Among those killed in the attack near the airport was Mohammad Akhtar, a 31-year-old father of four children who was working as driver for the news agency Agence France Presse in Afghanistan.  Hundreds of relatives, friends and family members attended a burial ceremony for Akhtar in the Guldara district north of the capital Kabul on Monday morning.  In April AFP's chief photographer in Afghanistan, Shah Maria killed along with eight other reporters in a double suicide bombing by the Islamic State group in Kabul.  The attack marked the deadliest assault on reporters since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 and claimed a total of 25 lives and wounded at least 45 others.  Akhtar was related to the late Maria and was on his way to office for his night shift when the suicide bomber blew himself up near the airport.  ""There were both military and civilians who were killed and wounded in the attack and the dead toll could change,"" said Stanekzai, spokesman for the Kabul police chief.  The number of civilians killed in Afghanistan in the first half of this year has increased by 1 percent, according to the latest report by the United Nations, compared to the same period last year.  The U.N. mission in Afghanistan said the number Ã¢â‚¬â€ 1,692 killed by violence Ã¢â‚¬â€ is the highest 6-month death toll since the systematic documentation of civilian casualties started in 2009.  The UNAMA report documented 3,430 Afghan civilians were wounded in the period from January to June. The killed and wounded add up to a total of 5,122 civilian casualties, which is a three percent overall decrease from the first six months of 2017, it added.  Since the U.S. and NATO forces formally concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014, a resurgent Taliban has stepped up its attacks across the country and an Islamic State affiliate has also emerged to launch horrific high-profile attacks that have claimed the lives of scores of civilians.",en,terrorattack,,

With its dream of a Caliphate in the Middle East now dead, Islamic State has switched to hit-and-run attacks aimed at undermining the government in Baghdad, according to military, intelligence and government officials interviewed by Reuters.  Advertisement  Islamic State was reinventing itself months before Baghdad announced in December that it had defeated the group, according to intelligence officials who said it would adopt guerrilla tactics when it could no longer hold territory.  Iraq has now seen an increase in kidnappings and killings, mainly in the provinces of Kirkuk, Diyala, and Salahuddin, since it held an election in May, indicating the government will come under renewed pressure from a group that once occupied a third of the country during a three-year reign of terror.  Last month saw at least 83 cases of kidnap, murder or both in the three provinces. Most occurred on a highway connecting Baghdad to Kirkuk province. In May, the number of such incidents in that area was 30, while in March it was seven, according to Hisham al-Hashimi, an expert on Islamic State who advises the Iraqi government.  In one incident on June 17, three Shi'ite men were kidnapped by Islamic State militants disguised as policemen at a checkpoint on the highway. Ten days later their mutilated corpses were discovered, rigged with explosives to kill anyone who found them.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Speaking in the Shi'ite holy city of Kerbala surrounded by children wearing photos of their slain fathers around their necks, Bassem Khudair, a relative of the men, said security forces were uncooperative.  He had implored the soldiers who found the men's bullet-ridden car to pursue the kidnappers but was refused.  ""We went alone, bearing personal responsibility, as three of our own had been taken and we couldn't just watch,"" he said. ""Six of us, all civilians, walked for about 10 or 12 kilometres. We found their documents scattered on the ground as we walked.""  The next day, he received a phone call from his brother. The men were alive but held by Islamic State. One of the kidnappers had said they would be executed if the government did not release all female Sunni prisoners.  The kidnapper then called Khudair daily. Khudair informed the government but none of Iraq's intelligence agencies offered to trace the caller's location, he said.  Ten days later, the kidnapper told Khudair the men were dead. Military commanders in the provinces of Diyala and Salahuddin ducked responsibility for retrieving the bodies.  Diyala Provincial Council Chairman Ali al-Dani said the advantage currently lay with Islamic State. ""The terrorists now are moving in small groups that are hard to track. Intelligence work is needed,"" he said.  ""The situation is confusing, and the reason is the chaos within the security forces. There isn't one command leading security in the province. This strengthens Daesh,"" said Salahuddin Provincial Council Chairman Ahmed al-Kareem, using a pejorative term for Islamic State.  That kind of disarray among the security forces has allowed Islamic State to stage a comeback, according to military, police, intelligence, and local elected officials.  They said poor coordination, meagre support from the central government, and a culture of avoiding responsibility are hindering efforts to contain the group, which continues to stage a steady stream of lower-level attacks in addition to the spike in kidnap and murder.  A military spokesman did not respond to phone calls and written requests for comment. The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said in a statement that it ""has no safe haven in Iraq"".  For a graphic on Islamic State incidents, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Lc7jkz  HIT AND RUN  The militants have regrouped in the Hemrin mountain range in the northeast, which extends from Diyala, on the border with Iran, crossing northern Salahuddin and southern Kirkuk, and overlooks Iraq's main highway. Officials describe the area as a ""triangle of death"".  Military and intelligence officials gave varying estimates of how many Islamic State fighters remain active in Iraq.  Hashimi puts the number at more than 1,000, with around 500 in desert areas and the rest in the mountains.  Al Qaeda once held sway over most of Iraq's Sunni areas until it was beaten by U.S. and Iraqi troops and their tribal allies during the ""surge"" campaign of 2006-2007.  Its remnants hid in the desert between Syria and Iraq and later turned into Islamic State. Some officials fear an even more radical group could emerge if there are gaps in security.  ""Filth wandering the desert for a loaf of bread is what they are,"" said an intelligence official in Tikrit, the Salahuddin provincial capital. Fighters are resorting to Al Qaeda's tactics: quick attacks then retreating into the desert.  Even though they possess machine guns, anti-tank weapons and mines, the militants cannot penetrate cities because they no longer enjoy support among those Sunnis who once sympathised with them, said Eid Khalaf, Salahuddin's deputy chief of police.  ""They can't get food or weapons from citizens,"" he said. ""Their operations are primitive; they can't send a car bomb into a city.""  Each Islamic State cell contains between three and five fighters, said Diyala Operations Commander Lieutenant General Muzher al-Azawi. He said there were no more than 75 fighters in the province.  ""They hide in the mountains, making it hard to find them. They plant explosives, use hit-and-run tactics, and snipers. They set up fake checkpoints for kidnappings,"" he said.  'CITIES WILL FALL'  Numerous attempts to track down and kill Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have failed, and his fighters are still active in other Arab states.  In Syria, Islamic State still holds some territory but has suffered militarily. In Egypt, it is concentrated in the sparsely populated northern Sinai desert. It holds no territory but conducts hit-and-run attacks.  Islamic State has tried to rebuild in Libya through mobile units in the desert and sleeper cells in northern cities.  The group has exploited the ethnic and sectarian divide in Iraq. Iraqi and Kurdish forces fought together against Islamic State. Now ties are strained over a Kurdish bid for independence last year which Baghdad stifled.  Lack of coordination has caused a security vacuum in disputed territories, from which Iraqi forces dislodged the Kurds, creating opportunities for Islamic State.  ""Are we expected to go into Diyala and help them clear the area then withdraw again? We are not being attacked in those areas, Iraqi forces are. We are not there, they expelled us,"" said a Kurdish security official.  Sunni tribesmen helped U.S. and Iraqi forces turn the tide in the war against al Qaeda. Local tribes now say they need help as Islamic State claws its way back.  ""We know these areas better than the security forces and at least 280 of us have been kidnapped or killed,"" said Shammar tribal chief Ali Nawaf.  Last month, militants drove into a village inhabited by Shammar tribesmen and kidnapped 30 men, he said. The next day, eight bodies were found tied up and blindfolded. Nawaf says he has 1,400 men ready to fight but they need help from the government in Baghdad.  ""Either the government sends more forces, or we raise Daesh flags. If we don't plug this hole now, entire cities will fall,"" Nawaf said.  (Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein in Baquba, Tikrit, and Kerbala; Editing by Michael Georgy and Giles Elgood)",en,terrorattack,,

A member of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) removes an Islamic State group flag in the Syrian town of Tabqa, about 55 kilometres (35 miles) west of Raqa city, on April 30, 2017  ""Three bombers with explosive belts targeted Sweida city alone, while the other blasts hit villages to the north and east,"" said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Britain-based Observatory, said the group then followed up with further attacks, seizing three of the seven villages it had targeted.  He said 26 pro-government fighters had been killed and more than 30 people wounded in the attack on populated areas close to Sweida city.  Syria's official news agency SANA confirmed the attack had killed and wounded people in the provincial capital.  State television also reported casualties in villages to the north and east, adding that the army was ""targeting positions of the Daesh (IS) terrorist group"" Sweida province's eastern countryside"".  Abdel Rahman said unidentified warplanes were also targeting IS fighters in the area.  Despite pro-government forces ousting the group from urban centres in eastern Syria last year, surprise raids in recent months have killed dozens of regime and allied fighters.  The regime of President Bashar al-Assad has in recent weeks ousted rebels from a majority of the country's south, part of which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  The regime controls almost all of Sweida province but IS retains a presence in desert areas of its north and east.  It is now closing in on a patch of territory in nearby Daraa province held by jihadist group Jaish Khaled bin al-Walid, which has pledged allegiance to IS.  The group, which has around 1,000 fighters in the region, has been the target of an intense campaign of bombing by Russian and Syrian jets in recent days.  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group made up mostly of ex-members of the former Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, also has a few hundred men in the south.  A Syrian military source accused Israel on Tuesday of firing at one of its warplanes as it carried out operations against jihadists in southern Syria.  Israel's army earlier said it had shot down a Syrian fighter jet that had infiltrated Israeli airspace, risking another escalation in the sensitive border zone.  The Observatory later said air operations had dramatically decreased following the incident.  The Damascus regime has long accused Israel of backing IS and other opposition factions.

The main Kurdish groups have emerged among the few winners of the conflict in Syria, carving out autonomous rule over large parts of the north under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia.  They have mostly avoided conflict with Assad, at times even fighting common foes -- including rebels his forces are gradually crushing with help from Russia and Iran.  Talks between the Syrian Kurds and Damascus have now begun on a return of state employees and repairs to one of Syria's most important pieces of infrastructure: the Tabqa dam, the country's largest, which the SDF took from Islamic State last year with U.S. air power.  A top Kurdish official has also signalled the fighters could join any future offensive against rebels holding Idlib province bordering Turkey, and cooperate more widely against Turkey, which has sent forces into an arc of Syria's northwest.  A decision to stop calling their police force by its Kurdish name, ""Asayish"", is another step that appears aimed at overhauling the region's image with an eye to its future.  Syria's Kurds, which the Baathist state systematically persecuted for years, say they do not seek independence, but they hope a political deal will safeguard their autonomy.  For the first time, Assad said in May he was ""opening doors"" for talks with the SDF, while also threatening force. A deal between them could settle the conflict in most of Syria.  But there is no sign of Damascus coming to the table yet, and analysts say Assad is in no rush as he has fast recovered ground and his position is growing stronger.  ""We have a conviction that channels must be open...the constitution, the political process, these will not be solved without the regime,"" said Ilham Ahmed, a senior Kurdish official in the SDF's political wing. ""The regime is not going anywhere.""  WHAT AMERICA WANTS  With the Kurdish YPG militia at its forefront, the SDF holds around a quarter of Syria, the biggest chunk outside state control. About 2,000 U.S. forces are deployed in the region across the north and east, rich in oil, water and agricultural land -- important leverage for the Kurds.  The YPG joined forces with the United States more than three years ago, becoming its main Syrian partner in the fight against Islamic State. The alliance flew in the face of U.S. ties with NATO member Turkey, which views the YPG as terrorists linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).  Washington has avoided making any political promises to the Kurds and opposes their autonomy ambitions. Conflicting U.S. statements over Syria have put them on guard, and they worry Washington may ultimately put its ties with Turkey first.  U.S. President Donald Trump said in April he wanted to withdraw troops from Syria soon, while tempering that by expressing a desire to leave a ""strong and lasting footprint"".  Other U.S. officials have played down the odds of a withdrawal any time soon. The U.S. military has at times used lethal force to defend SDF territory against pro-government forces.  ""It's not clear what they want,"" Ahmed told Reuters.  The SDF has become wary, especially after an ""American silence"" during a Turkish offensive on Syria's Kurdish Afrin region this year. ""We felt let down,"" she said.  Despite this, she said the deployment of U.S. forces in nearby Manbij sent a strong message after Turkey threatened to march on the town.  Henri Barkey, an international relations professor at Lehigh University in the United States, said U.S. policy has pushed Kurdish leaders towards Damascus.  ""If you're a Syrian Kurd, you have to think about the day Trump decides to withdraw,"" he said. ""You have a president who can change his mind and order policies that are completely contradictory.""  POLICE FORCE ""FOR EVERYONE""  Syrian Kurdish leaders have moved more cautiously than Kurds across the border in Iraq who voted for independence in a referendum last year. The vote, which Washington opposed, plunged them into crisis and regional isolation. Eventually, they were forced to backtrack.  Last year, the Kurdish-led authorities in north Syria embarked on elections to set up governing bodies based on the political ideas of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. But they have now indefinitely postponed the final stage of the election.  Analysts say friction with pro-Damascus Arab tribes poses a challenge to the Kurdish forces, and Assad may seek to benefit from the discord.  Pictures of Ocalan, revered by the YPG, were taken down last month in Qamishli, a city it controls on the border with Turkey. A local municipal statement said this was to ""beautify and organise"" the streets.  Last week, the region's police changed its name and flag, a move which leading Kurdish politician Aldar Xelil said was ""out of consideration"" for Arab cities the SDF seized from Islamic State including Raqqa, which had been the jihadists' Syrian capital.  ""This way the (police) force will be for everyone,"" he said.  Syrian state officials have highlighted Raqqa as a key target for ""liberation"" from foreign occupiers - a reference to American forces. An SDF-backed council now runs the city, much of which was destroyed by months of U.S. air strikes.  Critics say U.S. recovery aid has fallen short.  Fixing the hydroelectric Tabqa dam near Raqqa is a top priority. Without the government's help, restoring it would need major foreign aid, Ahmed said. Talks over collaborating on health and education could follow.  ""It could pave the way, play a positive role in growing trust for us to take it a step further,"" he said.

After coming out of the water, the individual began experiencing severe leg pain and presented to a hospital in Nueces County, Texas, where doctors noticed classic signs of bacterial infection, according to local health officials.  Measures were taken to fight the infectionÃ¢â‚¬â€referred to as vibriosisÃ¢â‚¬â€and the leg was amputated but the patient passed away a day after being admitted.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vibrio bacteria naturally inhabit coastal waters where oysters live,Ã¢â‚¬Â the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District said in a statement. Ã¢â‚¬Å“These bacteria present in higher concentrations between May and October when water temperatures are warmer.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The bacteria can enter the body through skin tears or open wounds, as is the case with the latest death, or by consuming raw or undercooked shellfish.  It can cause severe and life-threatening infections that can lead to septic shock. For those who eat contaminated shellfish, symptoms can include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills and severe pain.  Meanwhile, if the bacteria enters through a wound, symptoms may also include the breakdown of the skin in the infected area or blistering lesions. (Vibrio is not a truly flesh-eating bacteria like streptococcus A, although it is often described as such because the lesions it can cause are similar.)  Vibrio vulnificus is a rare cause of disease, with only around 200 infections occurring in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, about one in four of those infected die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill.  People with compromised immune systems, such as the elderly or those with chronic liver disease, are more at risk of severe complications.  There are several other species of Vibrio bacteria which cause less serious vibriosis infections. The CDC estimates that, in total, vibriosis causes 80,000 illnesses each year in the United States. About 52,000 of these are estimated to be the result of eating contaminated food. The most commonly reported species, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, is thought to cause 45,000 of these illnesses.  The CDC offers the following advice to reduce your risk of vibriosis infection:  DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t eat raw or undercooked oysters or other shellfish.  Always wash your hands with soap and water after handling raw shellfish.  Avoid contaminating cooked shellfish with raw shellfish and its juices.  Stay out of brackish or salt water if you have a wound (including cuts and scrapes), or cover your wound with a waterproof bandage if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a possibility it could come into contact with brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices. Brackish water is a mixture of fresh and sea water. It is often found where rivers meet the sea.  Wash wounds and cuts thoroughly with soap and water if they have been exposed to seawater or raw seafood or its juices.  If you develop a skin infection, tell your medical provider if your skin has come into contact with brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices.  - Newsweek",en,diseas,,

Alvaro Leiva, director of the Nicaraguan Pro-Human Rights Association, said 399 of the dead had been identified and there were photographs, news reports and other evidence to document the other cases.  The unrest began in April as protests against proposed social security cuts, which were later scrapped. Following a violent crackdown by security forces and allied armed civilian groups, the demonstrations grew and broadened in scope to accuse the president of being an authoritarian and include a demand for early elections.  Ortega has denied any responsibility for the killings and accuses those seeking his exit of being coup plotters. He also rejected the idea of moving up the presidential vote scheduled for 2021, something that domestic critics, the Organization of American States, the United States and other nations have called for.  Leiva said the most deaths, 189, took place in Managua. That was followed by 55 in Masaya, southeast of the capital.  Attacks attributed to Nicaraguan security forces and armed supporters of Ortega's Sandinista movement have also recently begun squarely targeting the Roman Catholic Church, including church buildings, priests and even the cardinal.

Israel rejects the widely-held view that settlement expansion is one of the greatest obstacles to peace with the Palestinians.  Attacks against Israelis in the West Bank are supported by many Palestinians as pushing back against settlement growth.  US President Donald Trump's special envoy Jason Greenblatt called on Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, whose Fatah movement leads the government in the West Bank, to condemn the attack.  ""Yet another barbaric attack tonight. When will President Abbas and Palestinian leaders condemn the violence?"" he wrote on Twitter.  Yet another barbaric attack tonight.

The attack came after a period of relative calm in the West Bank.

Syrian state TV and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition-linked war monitoring group, both reported government attacks on the Yarmouk basin region in southern Syria.  The area is controlled by a group linked to IS that has been in retreat in recent weeks near the border with Jordan and the frontier of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  Syrian state TV aired live footage from the area in which troops pounded IS positions with multiple rocket launchers.  The Observatory reported that government helicopter gunships pounded several villages held by IS, including Shajara, Abdeen and Koya.

A court ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict the man, an alleged neo-Nazi, who was charged with 12 counts of attempted murder.  The pipe bomb badly injured 10 of the 12 people, including a pregnant woman who lost her child and one of her feet.  Ahead of the verdict, prosecutors said an acquittal would be ""the most serious legal error"" in DÃƒÂ¼sseldorf's history.  During the trial, several witnesses withdrew or changed their statements, resulting in judges releasing the defendant - named in court as Ralf S - from pre-trial detention in May.  German police had questioned the former soldier and known gun fanatic in the wake of the bombing at the Wehrhahn commuter train station.  Unable to charge him, they remained without a formal suspect for 17 years.  While serving prison time for an unrelated charge in 2014, the now 52-year-old allegedly boasted about carrying out the attack to a fellow inmate, using a racial slur against immigrants.  In 2017, officers then arrested and charged Ralf S for the bombing. He denied any involvement.  'Chatterbox and stupid gossip'  Prosecutors pointed to a number of admissions Ralf S had made in recorded telephone calls.  However his defence lawyers countered, saying witness testimony was unreliable and that there was no evidence to connect him to the scene of the crime.  Ralf S may be a ""chatterbox and a stupid gossip"", they said, but that did not make him a dangerous extremist.  The 2000 bomb blast was one of a number of xenophobic attacks at the time that shocked Germany.  The victims were mostly Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, returning from German language classes in the area.  The authorities' inability to solve the case raised questions about the initial investigation, particularly after it came to light in 2011 that German intelligence agencies had turned a blind eye to a neo-Nazi cell, which committed 10 racially motivated murders, two bomb attacks, and several bank robberies between 2000 and 2007.",en,terrorattack,,

Defence Department officials said they expected most of the troop cuts and scaled-back missions to come from Central and West Africa, where Special Operations missions have focused on training African militaries to combat the growing threat from extremist Islamic militant groups.  The plan by General Thomas D. Waldhauser, the leader of US Africa Command, follows an ambush in Niger late last year that killed four American soldiers and an attack in southwestern Somalia that killed another in June.  In an interview with The New York Times, General Waldhauser said his plan would help streamline the military's ability to combat threats around the world - but not retreat from Africa.  ""We're not walking away,"" he said at his Germany headquarters last week, adding that the United States would still ""reserve the right to unilaterally return"" to protect American interests.  Africa has increasingly become an emerging battlefield for the United States in the fight against Islamic militant groups, including the Islamic State, Boko Haram and others across the continent that have sworn loyalty to al-Qaeda.  None of the offshoots of those groups have directly attacked the United States from Africa. But the Pentagon has for years sought to train local forces to deal with Islamic extremists in Africa - in part to distance the United States from any threats brewing on the continent.  Related Story US defence chief James Mattis visits China as tensions simmer  Related Story Want US protection? Pay for it  Carter F. Ham, a retired Army general who once led Africa Command, said he agreed ""in principle"" with paying more attention to Russia and China - the notion at the heart of a national defence strategy unveiled in January by Defence Secretary Jim Mattis.  But, Ham said, ""my concern in Africa is that with an already very modest presence and level of engagement, reducing that will lessen the likelihood for good outcomes across the continent."" Africa receives a small portion of Pentagon investment compared with Germany, South Korea and Japan, for instance.  General Waldhauser said Africa Command was the first to be asked to submit a drawdown plan, as The Times initially reported in June. But he said he expected other American combatant commands around the world to do the same under the defence strategy to better position the US military against threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.  The strategy represented a shift from fighting terrorism to countering state threats. When he announced it in January, Mr Mattis declared that ""we will continue to prosecute the campaign against terrorists, but great power competition - not terrorism - is now the primary focus of US national security."" The drawdown in Africa, General Waldhauser said, will include the departure of hundreds of Special Operations troops and their support forces. It will begin in places like Cameroon, where American war planners believe their efforts to train that country's special operations forces have been largely successful. The United States has about 300 troops in Cameroon.  General Waldhauser said Cameroon's security forces have improved to the point where they no longer need Americans to accompany them on missions.  ""They can do it on their own,"" he said. ""That would be an example of a country where we have worked ourselves out of a job."" A Defence Department official said Nigerien forces are also considered to be improving to the point where they may soon not need American help.  But it was in Niger in October where four American soldiers, their translator and four Nigerien troops were killed when their convoy was attacked near the border with Mali. A Pentagon investigation into the attack found a ""general lack"" of ""command oversight at every echelon.""  Mr J. Peter Pham, an Africa specialist at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said that too many US Special Operations forces - especially in places like Somalia - could lull local officials into complacency and dependency, preventing them from getting their own soldiers up to speed.  ""Islamist terror threats are indeed on the rise on the continent, but that doesn't mean that every Islamist terrorist needs to be hunted down by US Special Forces,"" Mr Pham said.  Still, he added, ""great power competition also happens in Africa,"" and pointed to a recent tussle between the United States and China, both of which have major military bases in Djibouti. The United States complained in May that Chinese nationals pointed lasers at US military aircraft near Djibouti, a charge strongly disputed by Beijing.  More than 7,300 Special Operations troops are working around the world, many of them conducting shadow wars against terrorists in Yemen, Libya, Somalia and other hot spots. About 1,200 of those troops are on missions in Africa, and they are facing the most immediate drawdown.  As part of the plan, the Africa Command was asked how it would conduct its counterterrorism missions if the number of US commandos there was cut by 25 per cent over 18 months, and by 50 percent over three years.  Ultimately, that would leave about 700 troops - roughly the same number as in 2014, according to data from Africa Command's special operations branch. By comparison, there were 70 Special Operations troops on the continent in 2006.  General Waldhauser said the cuts, which top officials in Washington are reviewing, will not be that deep for Army Special Forces known as Green Berets. But he declined to give specific figures, citing classification restrictions.  Even before Mr Mattis' directive, the Special Operations Command had begun to rely on conventional troops for some of the missions it had taken on since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In places where Special Operations troops are frequently in combat, such as Afghanistan and Syria, regular soldiers and Marines are sometimes attached to commando units for security or firepower.  General Waldhauser said that in Africa, state National Guard units - from California, Michigan and Indiana - could be paired with African militaries as Special Operations units draw down.",en,terrorattack,,

The 18-year-old was sitting her GCSEs when she was seduced by IS fighter Naweed Hussain, originally from Coventry and more than 15 years her senior.  She hid her Islamic State-inspired plans in coded conversations about preparations for an innocent Mad Hatter's tea party.  Judge Mark Dennis QC sentenced Boular to life imprisonment with a minimum of 13 years at the Old Bailey on Friday - making her the last member of Britain's first all-women terror cell to be jailed.

Boular turned to plotting a suicide bomb and gun attack on the British Museum with her older sister and mother instead of going through with a terror attack in Syria.  She played a ""leading role"" in the ""advanced plan"", according to the judge.  Judge Dennis rejected claims Boular had entirely renounced her Islamist views and downplayed the extent grooming played in her radicalisation.  ""In my view there's insufficient evidence to say at this stage this defendant is a truly transformed individual. Her views were deeply entrenched,"" he told the Old Bailey.

Her sister Rizlaine, 22, and her mother Mina Dich pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to taking over the plot and planning their own attack, after Safaa was arrested by police in April last year.  Their plans were uncovered by online M15 role-players and the Boular family home in Vauxhall, south London, was bugged.

The camp's former dwellers took off ""after persuasive legal arguments,"" Serhiy Mazur, an activist with the C14 organization, wrote on Facebook, suggesting the actions of civic-minded volunteers rather than vigilantes. Mazur added: ""Further raids are planned.""  The April attack was the first of 11 forced removals that ultranationalists in Ukraine carried out at settlements of Roma Ã¢â‚¬â€ an ethnic group, also known as Gypsies, that faces discrimination and disdain in much of Europe.  ""We were called garbage and dirt, kicked and driven off,"" Aza Rustik, who fled during the first raid. ""I just managed to grab the children and a bag with documents.""  During an especially vicious assault in a wooded area in western Ukraine, a gang armed with chains and pieces of metal pipe killed a 23-year-old man and injured four others outside the city of Lviv. Radical nationalist groups claimed responsibility for all 11 attacks, asserting they acted in concert with police and openly posted about their exploits on social media.  After the April camp invasion, C14's Mazur was charged with hooliganism. Two lawmakers spoke on his behalf, and he was released to await trial under house arrest.  ""I would like to hear from the police and the neighborhood administrative officials, who many times asked us for help,"" he said when he appeared in court last month.  The attacks and the prospect of more violence are terrifying to Ukraine's estimated 100,000 Roma.  ""They threw stones at us, and when we jumped out of the tent, they beat us indiscriminately,"" recalled Klara Gaga, a survivor of the fatal attack outside Lviv.  Four suspects have been detained in the Lviv attack; another 12 were detained as suspects in the attack in Ternopil, but subsequently were released from custody. The attackers in Ternopil fired gunshots to scare Roma.  ""Not a single person has been sentenced in attacks on the Roma in Ukraine. That illustrates better than any words the attitude of the authorities,"" Zola Kondur, a leader of Roma organization Chiricli, said.  Representatives of extremist groups justify the actions by saying they liquidate illegal Roma settlements because authorities have not. Right-wing nationalist groups such as C14 have seen their popularity and power grow in recent years amid Ukraine's confrontations with Russia and corruption-riddled domestic politics.  ""State institutions are weak, the police are ineffective and the government is forced to resort more and more to the services of right-wing groups, giving them a carte blanche in return,"" said Vadim Karasev, director of independent Kiev-based think tank Institute of Global Strategies.  Police reject any connection with the right-wing radicals. Arthur Sokolov, who is the lead investigator in the Mazur case, said he didn't know anything about C14 ties with local authorities and police.  ""There were no preliminary agreements between the police and other formations,"" he said in response to a question from The Associated Press about Mazur's claim that police asked C14 for help. He rejected the claim, saying he's unaware of anything like that.  But Eugene Savvateev, who for several years was involved in the training and integration of Roma children, alleged that police and the nationalists work together.  Savvateev spoke to Roma, who said that police drove them away when they visited the camp to gather what was left after the attack, adding to their feeling that C14 and police work together. They also recalled that C14 members accompanied local officials who visited the camp in the past.  ""The authorities do not want to dirty their hands, so they use C14,"" Savvateev said. ""Police came to the settlement after the attack to drive Roma away, and after that Roma certainly don't trust police and believe they work in sync with the attackers.""  Animosity toward Roma is high in Ukraine, where many residents resent their messy encampments and unsightly fixed settlements such as the Radvanka district in Uzhhorod, where houses resemble sheds made of stones, plywood and polystyrene, and children play in piles of rubbish.  ""Roma remain the most impoverished and unprotected part of Ukrainian society,"" Roma activist Myroslav Horvat, of the World Roma Organization in Uzhhorod, said. ""The state declares in words the programs of integration and training of the Roma, but there is no money for it, and everything remains only on paper.""  Hunger, poverty and unemployment drive hundreds of Roma to try to earn money in the richer center of the country. During the warm months of the year, the work might consist of searching for scrap metal, trading goods and telling fortunes on the street.  ""Gypsies in the cities Ã¢â‚¬â€ this is theft, robbery, drug trafficking and dirty dens,"" read leaflets bearing the symbols of nationalist groups Natskorpus and Natsdruzhiny that have appeared in Ukraine's major cities.  Western governments and international human rights groups have called on Ukrainian authorities to prosecute the perpetrators and stop turning a blind eye to violence against Roma.  ""Most of the crimes committed by radical groups have not been properly investigated by law enforcement agencies that do not want or cannot conduct effective investigations, even if certain groups publicly take responsibility for crimes,"" said Mariya Guryeva, an Amnesty International spokeswoman in Ukraine.  Government officials try to shift blame to Russia, alleging that it has sought to foment violence to destabilize Ukraine amid a tug-of-war between the two ex-Soviet neighbors.  ""We understand that the Russians always try to play with so-called interethnic problems,"" Security Service of Ukraine head Vasily Hrytsak said.

The militants accuse the neutral humanitarian group of failing to meet its obligations to help Taliban prisoners in a jail in Kabul.  The ICRC monitors detention conditions and provides medical aid. It scaled down its presence in Afghanistan last year after seven staff were killed.  The group told the BBC it was concerned by the Taliban's move.  Spokeswoman Andrea Catta Preta said the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) was in close contact with the militants and hoping to find a solution so the group's humanitarian work could continue.  The ICRC treats all parties harmed by warfare humanely and does not take sides. It has in the past given first aid training to Taliban members. It operates in Taliban-controlled areas with guarantees of safety and helps to repatriate bodies from both sides after fighting between the militants and the Afghan army.  In its statement on Monday, the Taliban said that many of its prisoners held in Pul-e-Charkhi jail in the capital Kabul were in a terrible state of health and that the ICRC would be responsible for whatever happened to them. Hundreds of fighters have been on hunger strike to demand better prison conditions.  The ICRC has worked in Afghanistan for 30 years and has more than 1,000 staff in the country.  Last October the group took the ""painful decision"" to close two offices and scale down operations at a third in order to protect staff.  The move came after six employees were shot dead in northern Jowzjan province and a physiotherapist was killed by a patient in Mazar-i-Sharif, also in the north.  Many other humanitarian organisations have pulled out of Afghanistan in recent years as Taliban and Islamic State group militants have stepped up attacks.  The Taliban's announcement on the ICRC comes at a time when militants have been launching several deadly attacks across Afghanistan.  In the latest major assault, as many as 44 Afghan police and soldiers were killed at a military outpost in northern Baghlan province early on Wednesday.

The killing of al-Asiri deals a heavy blow to the group's capabilities in striking western targets and piles pressure on the group that already lost some of its top cadres over the past years in similar drone strikes.  A Yemeni security official said that al-Asiri is dead; a tribal leader and an al-Qaida-linked source also said that he was killed in a U.S. drone strike in the eastern Yemeni governorate of Marib.  The tribal leader said that al-Asiri was struck, along with two or four of his associates, as he stood beside his car. He added that al-Asiri's wife, who hails from the well-known al-Awaleq tribe in the southern governorate of Shabwa, was briefly held months ago by the UAE-backed forces and later released.  Al-Qaida itself has remained silent about its top bomb maker. Instead of the typical ""eulogies"" on militant websites, the Yemeni source said the group is trying to hunt down suspected ""spies"" who might have tipped off the U.S. on his whereabouts leading up to the strike.  The security official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief reporters. The tribal leader and al-Qaida-linked source requested anonymity fearing for their safety.  The confirmation of al-Asiri's death follows a U.N. report this week saying that the 36-year-old Saudi national, who is among U.S.'s top most wanted militants, may have been killed in the second half of 2017.  Al-Asiri is believed to have built the underwear bomb that a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried to detonate on a passenger jet over Detroit in December 2009. He is also behind bombs hidden in printer cartridges placed on U.S.-bound cargo jets in 2010.  U.S. intelligence over the past years believed that al-Asiri and his confederates were constantly working to improve their bomb designs so that they could get past airport security.  In July 2014, the Transportation Security Administration banned uncharged mobile phones and laptops from flights to the United States that originated from Europe and the Middle East.  Al-Asiri, who studied chemistry in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, even once placed explosives inside his younger brother's clothes in a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's interior minister, Mohammed bin Nayef, in 2009. The brother, Abdullah, died in the explosion while the top U.S. counterterrorism ally was slightly wounded.  The U.S. has long viewed the al-Qaida's Yemeni branch as its most dangerous affiliate, in part because of al-Asiri's expertise in explosives. Since 2014, the U.S. has offered $5 million for information leading to his capture. He is thought to have escaped death many times in U.S. drone strikes in Yemen.  Al-Asiri's last known statement was a 2016 audio message threatening Saudi Arabia and the U.S. after the kingdom killed 47 al-Qaida suspects in one of its largest mass executions since 1980.  Vowing to continue battling America, he said at the time that the Saudis would be dealt with in a ""different way,"" without elaborating.  Wanted by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Interpol, al-Asiri fled his native Saudi Arabia Ã¢â‚¬â€ home of 15 of the 19 suspected hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks Ã¢â‚¬â€ for Yemen, along with other militants escaping a crackdown in the kingdom.  Once in Yemen, they merged with local al-Qaida militants who escaped from a Yemeni prison in 2006 to form Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP.  Since 2015, al-Qaida has exploited the turmoil in Yemen as a Saudi-led coalition imposed an air, land, and sea blockade and waged war on Yemen's Iranian-aligned rebels, known as Houthis, who gained control of the capital, Sanaa, forcing President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee the country.  Amid the chaos, AQAP has expanded its territory, occupied entire cities, looted security camps, banks, and collected taxes from locals.  The Saudi-led coalition, and in particular its key member the United Arab Emiratis, later claimed to have defeated al-Qaida and forced it to pull out of the territories under its control.  An Associated Press investigation however revealed that the coalition struck a series of deals with al-Qaida, offering tribal leaders cash to pay off militants to give up territory without fighting, something both the U.S., the UAE, and al-Qaida have denied.  The U.N. report on Monday, which first raised allegations that al-Asiri may have been killed, also said that al-Qaida's global network ""continues to show resilience,"" with its affiliates and allies much stronger than the Islamic State group in some places, including Somalia, Yemen, South Asia and Africa's Sahel region.  It added that Yemen's lack of a strong central government ""has provided a fertile environment for"" AQAP's expansion and estimated its strength inside Yemen at between 6,000 and 7,000 fighters Ã¢â‚¬â€ compared to IS militants who only number between 250 to 500 fighters.  Al-Qaida's top havens in Yemen are in the central Bayda and eastern Marib provinces. But since 2015, it has suffered heavy losses in leadership as U.S. drone strikes killed off top cadres, including co-founder Nasser al-Wahishi, who was Osama bin Laden top aide.

In a televised address on Sunday, Ghani said the truce would be ""until the prophet's birthday provided that the Taliban reciprocate"", referring to the Prophet Muhammad's birthday which is celebrated on November 21 in Afghanistan.  Ghani, who was speaking during a ceremony to mark the 99th Independence Day of Afghanistan at the iconic Darul Aman palace in the capital, Kabul, said the decision was reached after extensive consultation with different segments of the Afghan society and Islamic scholars worldwide.  The Taliban did not respond to requests for comment immediately but released a statement saying that they planned to free ""hundreds of prisoners"" on the occasion of Eid.  Ghani's ceasefire announcement was limited to the Taliban and excluded other armed groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).  It was immediately welcomed in neighbouring Pakistan.  ""Pakistan fully supports all such efforts that contribute to achieving durable stability and lasting peace in Afghanistan, a spokesperson for Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.  ""The people of Afghanistan deserve it. Coinciding with the Independence Day of Afghanistan, the announcement has an even greater significance.""  Record number of civilians killed  The Afghan government had previously announced a ceasefire with the Taliban during the Eid al-Fitr holiday in June.  That truce, the first formal, nationwide ceasefire since the 2001 US invasion. was indirectly accepted by the Taliban for three days, but the group later rejected a call by the president to extend it, with attacks resuming shortly after.  Ghani's announcement follows a bloody week of fighting across Afghanistan which saw the Taliban launch a massive assault against the provincial capital Ghazni - just a two-hour drive from Kabul.  At least 150 soldiers and 95 civilians were killed in a five-day siege, which eased last week when Afghan soldiers backed by US forces pushed back the group's heavily armed fighters.  Blasts, suicide attacks and clashes between the Taliban and Afghan forces killed over 1,600 civilians in the first six months of the year, the highest number in the past decade, despite June's truce, the United Nations said in a statement on Sunday.  Published by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the report attributed 42 percent of civilian casualties to the Afghan Taliban and 18 percent to the ISIL, noting a fourfold increase in deaths and injuries caused by both the armed groups.  Afghan security forces have struggled to battle the Taliban and ISIL since the US and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in the country in 2014 and shifted their focus to a ""support and counterterrorism"" role.  Meanwhile, pro-government forces, including Afghan national security troops and international military forces, caused a fifth of the civilian casualties so far this year.",en,terrorattack,,

Police said the man entered the station in Cornella, in the northeastern region of Catalonia, shortly before 0400 GMT, seeking information.  He then leapt towards an officer, brandishing a large knife they said. The attacker, identified only as living in Cornella, was shot dead.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“However you look at it, it was a knife attack against an officer (by a man who) shouted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Allah is greatÃ¢â‚¬Â and other things that were impossible to make out,Ã¢â‚¬Â regional investigating police chief Rafel Comas told a news conference.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“For now, we are treating it as a terrorist attack,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  The attacker Ã¢â‚¬Å“wanted to die himselfÃ¢â‚¬Â, police added on Twitter. Comas did not confirm Spanish media reports that he was a 29-year-old Algerian, saying only that he had been in the country Ã¢â‚¬Å“for yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  There was no evidence linking the attack with any terrorist cell, Comas said, adding that Spain would maintain its security alert at level 4, one notch below the maximum level which signals an attack is imminent.  Last Friday, Barcelona commemorated the first anniversary of an Islamist assault in which a young man drove a van down a busy central boulevard, killing 14 people and injuring over 100 in SpainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst attack in more than a decade.  Separately on Monday, three people were injured when a car mounted a pavement in the northern town of Casetas, in what a government spokeswoman later said was being treated as an accident.

Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the spate of violence, the SITE monitoring group reported, citing the group's Amaq website.  ""Fighters from the Islamic State attacked Chechen police officers and elements in Grozny and Shali in Mesker-Yurt,"" Amaq said. ISIL has claimed attacks in the past that it had no logistical role in.  Dzhambulat Umarov, information minister in the regional government, told the Tass news agency the attackers were aged between 11 and 16. He said ISIL has increasingly focused on teenagers in its efforts to recruit supporters.  Al Jazeera's Rory Challands, reporting from Moscow, said information on the situation in Chechnya was scarce.  ""These attacks appear not to have been particularly sophisticated or effective,"" he said. ""Exact details are still coming in. The Russian investigative committee says it has launched a criminal case into the attacks.""  Officials in Russia confirmed several policemen were wounded and at least five attackers killed in the capital Grozny and Shali.  ""The criminals were neutralised,"" the investigative committee said.  Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's president, said on his official Telegram social-networking account that one of the attacks saw a suicide bomber detonate his explosives in Mesker-Yurt, on the outskirts of Grozny. The attack injured several policemen, but the attacker survived and was taken to a hospital.  Kadyrov, who was visiting Saudi Arabia on Monday, said extremist propaganda that ""confuses the young men"" was to blame for the assaults.  He said the attacks were staged to ""darken"" the festivities as Muslims celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday.  Failed to explode  Police in the North Caucasus region said in another incident two men armed with knives attempted to enter the district police department in the town of Shali and ""inflicted wounds on two police employees on duty"" before being shot dead.  According to an anonymous source cited by RIA Novosti news agency, at least one female bystander was also wounded in the Shali incident.  In another attack in Shali, two assailants tried to blow up a truck loaded with gas canisters in a suicide mission, but the vehicle failed to explode, Kadyrov spokesman Alvi Karimov said on Kommersant FM radio. He said the two were shot dead by police.  There were also attacks in Grozny. In one incident, an attacker was allegedly shot dead after hitting a traffic policeman with his car. There were also reports of a shoot-out between police officers and attackers at the intersection between Pervyomaiskaya and Isaev streets in Grozny that killed one officer.  Chechnya's Interior Minister Ruslan Alkhanov said the attackers ""attempted to destabilise the situation in Chechnya"" but have been stopped. He said no officers were killed.  The Kremlin has relied on Kadyrov to stabilise Chechnya after two separatist wars in the 1990s and has provided generous subsidies to help rebuild the region.  International human rights groups have accused Kadyrov of rampant abuses, including arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings by his feared security forces.

The direct confrontations between soldiers and armed traffickers also marked a deepening of the military's role in Rio's security. Since the military was put in charge of the state's security earlier this year, soldiers have mostly played supporting roles to police during operations, such as securing perimeters or setting up checkpoints. On Monday, soldiers were clearly in the lead.  ""Our goal is only to make arrests. If there are deaths, the criminals are to blame,"" Carlos Cinelli, a military spokesman, told reporters while adding that military personnel came under fire during operations that began at 4:30 a.m. ""The soldiers have a right to defend themselves.""  Cinelli told reporters that five suspects were killed and another 10 were arrested when soldiers stormed the neighborhoods of Mare, Complexo do Alemao and Penha. In a press note later in the afternoon, the military command said one soldier died and another was injured in the operations.  Cinelli said the operations, which included more than 4,000 military personnel, were aimed at finding wanted traffickers in the areas. The operation netted four pistols, two grenades and 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of marijuana paste, he said.  Brazilian news site G1 reported that many residents in the areas stayed at home, skipping work and school. An Associated Press video journalist saw a public bus that had been torched close to Complexo do Alemao, possibly a response to the anti-drug operation.  Meanwhile Monday, police said they killed six suspects during confrontations in Niteroi, across the bay from Rio de Janeiro. Police said the shootouts happened while pursuing suspects on one of the access points to the bridge that joins the two cities. The bridge, one of the area's most traversed roads, was temporarily shut. Three suspects and one police officer were injured, according to a police statement.  By decree, in February President Michel Temer put the military in charge of security in the state of Rio. He made the decision after muggings and beatings were captured on camera during Rio's world-famous Carnival celebrations.  Human rights groups have criticized the intervention, saying it's disproportionately impacting people, particularly blacks, in poor neighborhoods.  ____  Associated Press video journalism Mario Lobao contributed to this report from Rio de Janeiro.",un,terrorattack,,

More than 41,000 people have been infected and at least 37 have died as a result of the contagious disease in 2018 so far.  It is the highest number of infections this decade, beating last year's number of 23,927.  ""Following the decade's lowest number of cases in 2016, we are seeing a dramatic increase in infections and extended outbreaks,"" Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, said in a statement.  ""Good health for all starts with immunisation, and as long as this disease is not eliminated we are failing to live up to our Sustainable Development Goal commitments,"" Jakab added.  The vast majority of infections this year occurred in Ukraine, where more than 23,000 people have been diagnosed with the disease.  Serbia has seen the highest number of deaths so far, with 14 people dying from the measles there.  According to the WHO, measles outbreaks can be stopped but immunisation rates have to be higher than 95 percent. However, the average immunisation rate for the whole of Europe was just 90 percent, with some areas reporting percentages as low as 70 percent.  ""We can stop this deadly disease. But we will not succeed unless everyone plays their part: to immunise their children, themselves, their patients, their populations - and also to remind others that vaccination saves lives,"" Jakab said.  Two years ago, Europe had a record low of measles instances, with only 5,273 people infected.  {articleGUID}  Last year, that number rose to 23,927.  ""This partial setback demonstrates that every person who is not immune remains vulnerable no matter where they live, and every country must keep pushing to increase coverage and close immunity gaps, even after achieving interrupted or eliminated status,"" said Nedret Emiroglu, director of the Division of Health Emergencies and Communicable Diseases at the WHO.  'Million of lives saved'  Measles is a potentially deadly viral disease, mostly spread through coughing and sneezing.  For infected people, most often children, there is currently no cure, but widespread vaccination programmes have resulted in an 84 percent decrease in the number of people killed by the disease between 2000 and 2013, the WHO reported.  In 2016, the WHO recorded 89,780 deaths, mostly children, as a result of the measles globally, making it the first year less than 100,000 people had died from the disease.  Before 1963, when the measles vaccine became widely available, around 2.6 million died of the viral infection on a yearly basis.

Other journalists were also beaten as they were reporting on the protests.  An army statement described the soldiers' conduct as ""unprofessional"" and said they would be arrested.  There has been political tension in Uganda after Wine, and four opposition MPs, were arrested last week.  Wine, who was a well-known musician before being elected an independent MP last year, is leading possibly the first major popular movement against President Yoweri Museveni by young people, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga.  Most Ugandans alive today were not yet born when Mr Museveni came to power in 1986.  Earlier, New York-based Human Rights Watch called on the Ugandan police and military to stop attacks on the media and respect the rights of all protesters.  In footage shared online, Reuters photojournalist James Akena can be seen being beaten with a stick by two soldiers on a street in the capital, Kampala.  The beating carried on even after Mr Akena put his hands up and fell to his knees.  ""The behaviour of the police or the security personnel has never been this way, so it is difficult to tell why this time round they have taken this new trend,"" Mr Akena told BBC Focus on Africa radio.  On Monday one person was killed and more than 100 arrested.

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday during a visit to Jerusalem, John Bolton said: ""We now see plans for the Syrian regime to resume offensive military activities in Idlib province.  ""We are obviously concerned about the possibility that Assad may use chemical weapons again.  ""Just so there's no confusion here, if the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons we will respond very strongly and they really ought to think about this a long time,"" he added.  The Idlib region, a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria as well as powerful armed forces, was hit by a wave of air attacks and shelling this month, in a possible prelude to a full-scale government offensive.  In April, the Trump administration mustered a coalition of US, French and British forces to attack Syrian government facilities allegedly related to the production of chemical weapons after a poison gas attack killed dozens of people in Douma district.  Damascus, endorsed by Moscow, has denied using such weapons.  Under Trump, the US has sought to disengage from Syria, where the previous administration deployed some troops and gave limited support to rebel Kurdish forces over the objections of NATO partner Turkey.  Iran sanctions  Bolton also said that the Trump administration was not seeking to overthrow Iran's leadership with its reimposition of sanctions on Tehran.  ""Regime change in Iran is not American policy but what we want is massive change in the regime's behaviour,"" he said.  Bolton arrived in Israel on Sunday for three days of talks expected to focus mainly on Iran and its presence in Syria.  Israel and Syria share a border and Iran is backing Assad in his country's civil war, along with Russia and Iranian-backed Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to prevent Iran from entrenching itself militarily in Syria, and a series of recent attacks that killed Iranians there has been attributed to Israel.  ""Every time that Iran has brought missiles or other threatening weapons into Syria in recent months Israel has struck those targets,"" Bolton said.  ""I think that's a legitimate act of self-defence on the part of Israel,"" he added.  The Trump administration slapped back sanctions this month after withdrawing from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, which Washington regards as insufficient for denying Tehran the means to make an atomic bomb and as a spur for its meddling in neighbouring Middle East countries.  The US turnaround outraged Iran, which has taken a defiant stance, and has rattled other world powers where some businesses have been debating whether to divest from Iran.  ""Let me be clear, the reimposition of the sanctions, we think, is already having a significant effect on Iran's economy and on, really, popular opinion inside Iran,"" Bolton told Reuters in advance of Wednesday's press conference.  ""I think the effects, the economic effects certainly, are even stronger than we anticipated,"" Bolton said.  ""But Iranian activity in the region has continued to be belligerent: what they are doing in Iraq, what they are doing in Syria, what they are doing with Hezbollah in Lebanon, what they are doing in Yemen, what they have threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz.""  The Iranian economy has been beset by high unemployment, inflation and a rial currency that has lost half its value since April. The reimposition of sanctions could make matters worse.  Thousands of Iranians have protested in recent weeks against sharp price rises of some food items, a lack of jobs and state corruption. The protests over the cost of living have often turned into anti-government rallies.  Commenting on the speech, Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, reporting from Jerusalem, said: ""It is clear that both he [Bolton] and Israeli prime minister and Israeli government are almost in lockstep in their view on the 'Iran problem', as Netanyahu continues to outline it.""  ""Particularly in terms of the rejection of the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran and its deleterious effects and the need for continued pressure for the sanctions the US has imposed to be shared and endorsed by the [other] countries,"" he added.",en,terrorattack,,

The individual is the fifth person ever to be diagnosed with the disease in the country.  The patient, who traveled into the UK aboard a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight, was first admitted to a hospital in Leeds before being transferred to the Royal Liverpool Hospital in Liverpool, which specializes in respiratory infectious diseases. The patient is currently stable and receiving the necessary treatment.  ""The patient is thought to have contracted the infection whilst in the Middle East before traveling to the UK,"" said Dr. Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at PHE.  ""Public Health England is following up those who have had close and sustained contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary.""  What is MERS?  MERS is a viral respiratory illness brought on by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It is in the same family of viruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS ), as well as the common cold.  Symptoms include shortness of breath, fever, cough, kidney failure and gastrointestinal issues, however not all of those infected with the illnesses are symptomatic.  Researchers don't yet know its exact mode of transmission, but the illness -- first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 -- generally spreads through close contact with people who are ill . It is thought to spread through respiratory secretions, such as coughing.  Because little is known about the epidemiology of the disease, for example how people are infected and how it spreads, treating the illness can be complicated, according to Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine International Public Health.  ""MERS-CoV is a disease we worry about because we don't have any specific countermeasures to it. We've got no specific drugs, no specific vaccine, or anything to deal with it,"" said Whitworth.  ""Essentially we need to identify cases, get them into isolation and to give them intensive supportive care until they get better.""  The virus was possibly first transmitted from an animal to a human, as a 2014 study showed that three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past MERS exposure. It's believed that the disease originated in bats and was then passed on to camels, according to WHO.  Since September 2012 -- when the first case was detected in humans -- there have been 2,229 other laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, according to WHO, which resulted in the deaths of 791 people, around 35% of reported patients.  The illness has been detected in 27 countries, including the UK, the United States, Turkey, Thailand and China among others. Around 80% of cases have been detected in Saudi Arabia.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  Nonetheless, human-to-human transmission of the virus is difficult.  ""It is important to emphasize that although a case has been identified, the overall risk of disease transmission to the public is very low,"" said Harries.  PHE is currently contacting people who might have had close contact with the infected individual in order to monitor symptoms. This includes a number of passengers who traveled on the same flight as the patient.  ""As we've seen in previous cases, we have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimize the risk of transmission,"" said Harries.

BEIRUT: The US-led coalition said Thursday (Aug 23) the leadership of the Islamic State group was now ""irrelevant"" after IS issued an audio message it said was by its chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Coalition spokesman Colonel Sean Ryan's statement came after Baghdadi called on Muslims to wage ""jihad"" in the purported recording released late Wednesday.  Advertisement  ""He's been rendered useless and ineffective, so we're not too concerned by any comments coming from ISIS leadership,"" Ryan said, using another acronym for the jihadist group.  Baghdadi has been pronounced dead on several occasions, but an Iraqi intelligence official said in May that he remains alive in Syrian territory by the Iraqi border.  His last purported message was released in September 2017, shortly after forces backed by the US-led coalition expelled IS from its de facto capital of Raqa.  ""We believe his leadership is irrelevant,"" Ryan told journalists in a conference call.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""We're focused on defeating the last remnants of ISIS, so whether he is around or not doesn't really matter.""  Originally from Iraq, Baghdadi has been dubbed the ""most wanted man on the planet"" and the United States is offering a US$25 million reward for his capture.  IS overran large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014 and proclaimed a ""caliphate"" in territory it controlled, but has since lost most of it to various offensives.  In Syria, IS fighters still hold a pocket of territory in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, and are present in the vast desert stretching from Damascus to the Iraqi border.  In Deir Ezzor, Russia-backed regime forces have pushed back the jihadists to the west of the Euphrates River, while the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-Arab alliance backed by the coalition, have fought them on its eastern banks.  Ryan said the SDF were now preparing to expel the jihadists from their Deir Ezzor holdout, though no ground offensive had yet started.  ""We have our mission and that is to defeat them in the lower Euphrates River Valley and that is what we're going to do,"" he said.

The killer had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters after visiting the scene in the town of Trappes.  The motive for the violence remained unclear despite a claim by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group that it was an attack by one of its fighters responding to the terror organisation's propaganda.  Mr Collomb said the attacker was ""mentally unstable, rather than someone who was committed, who would respond to orders from a terrorist organisation, in particular Daesh"", another name for ISIS.  Regular French criminal prosecutors are investigating the case rather than anti-terror specialists, Mr Collomb stressed, although checks on the attacker's phone and computer were under way.  ISIS claimed ""the person who carried out the attack in Trappes, south-west of Paris, was an Islamic State fighter"". ""He carried out the attack in response to calls to target subjects of the countries of the coalition"" fighting ISIS, said a statement on its propaganda channel Amaq.  The leader of the extremist group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had called on Muslims to wage ""jihad"" in a purported new audio recording released on Wednesday, in which he also called for attacks in the West.  Experts have urged caution about recent ISIS announcements because it has lost credibility after claiming responsibility for seemingly unrelated violence as it faces defeat in the Middle East.  The attacker in Trappes had been on the terror watch list after expressing extremist views, a security source told AFP. BFM television reported that he had serious alcohol and drug problems.  Armed police responded to reports of violence and were threatened by the man who stabbed his mother to death in her home, said Mr Collomb. ""He walked towards the police with his knife,"" he said. ""Police then opened fire."" The assailant has not yet been named.  Trappes, with a population of about 30,000, is known for its social problems linked to poverty, gangs and hardline interpretations of Islam. About 50 locals are suspected of having left France to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, French security sources had previously told AFP.  France remains on high alert after a string of militant attacks since 2015 that have claimed the lives of more than 240 victims.  Baghdadi's Telegram message on Eid al-Adha, the Islamic festival of sacrifice, was the first purported recording of the ISIS leader to be released since last September.  ISIS overran large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, proclaiming a ""caliphate"" in areas it controlled. But it has since lost most of that to various offensives in both countries.  The ""caliphate will remain, God willing"", Baghdadi said in Wednesday's recording, addressing followers in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. It was not clear when the message was recorded, but Baghdadi appeared to criticise a US$100 million (S$137 million) pledge by Saudi Arabia last week to help rebuild Syria's north-east. He threatened the US and Russia, which have both backed offensives against ISIS, saying that militants had prepared ""horrors"" for them.  The ISIS chief made his only known public appearance in Iraq's second city of Mosul in July 2014. Baghdadi has been dubbed the ""most wanted man on the planet"" and the US is offering a US$25 million reward for his capture.  AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE",en,terrorattack,,

The damning report contains allegations of murder, imprisonment and sexual violence against the Rohingyas, carried out by the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, under the guise of a crackdown on terrorists, and against a backdrop of impunity that effectively placed military leaders above the law.  ""Military necessity would never justify killing indiscriminately, gang raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages. The Tatmadaw's tactics are consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats, especially in Rakhine State, but also in northern Myanmar,"" the report said.  The report recommends the case be referred to the International Criminal Court in the Hague, or for an ad hoc tribunal to be created to investigate the actions of the alleged perpetrators. Six military leaders are named in the report, including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.  Referring to the unusual step of naming the alleged perpetrators in the report, mission member Radhika Coomaraswamy told the media in Geneva on Monday morning that they had found ""such overwhelming evidence"" of wrongdoing and that the command had ""such effective control from what we could gather that we could name ... who was responsible.""  The names of others thought to culpable have been ""put in an envelope"" and will be given to the Human Rights Commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, she said.  ""There are people we're very sure should be investigated.""  Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar Commander In-Chief (L) and National League for Democracy (NLD) party leader Aung San Suu Kyi (R) shake hands after a meeting in Naypyidaw on December 2, 2015.  UN investigators found that the Myanmar's civilian government had ""contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes"" through their ""acts and omissions.""  ""The State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine State,"" the report states.  Members of the misson said that the international community's involvement in the process is important, and that the country could not be expected to hold its military to account.  Given ""abusive military conduct going back half a century,"" and the ""complete impunity of military commanders (and the) almost complete immunity given to troops,"" expecting justice from domestic processes was ""simply naive,"" Christopher Sidoti, a member of the mission, said at a news conference.  Mass exodus  Last August, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims started fleeing across the border into Bangladesh into what's since become the world's biggest refugee camp. Many of those who crossed the border have recounted horrific stories of being driven from their homes under threat of death.  Myanmar's military has repeatedly denied that it has deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya. Instead, the authorities insist that it only targets Rohingya militants, mostly from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group, which has launched deadly attacks on police posts.  ""There is no evidence that Myanmar soldiers committed any human rights violations in their response to the ARSA terrorist attacks of 2017. We have recently formed a new independent commission, which will investigate alleged rights abuses in Rakhine State including rape. We will treat any case in accordance with the rule of law,"" Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Myanmar's presidential office told CNN earlier in August.  Despite being barred access to the affected regions, investigators conducted 875 interviews with victims and eyewitnesses, and examined satellite images and forensic and other documentary evidence.

Systematic campaign  The report by the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concludes that human rights violations in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states ""undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law.""  In the past, the United Nations has called the alleged campaign of violence, including mass killings, rape and the burning of Rohingya villages by Myanmar government forces a "" textbook example of ethnic cleansing ,"" while UN Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee has said that the attacks bear the ""hallmarks of genocide.""

The report also highlighted the role of hate speech spread on social media platforms, including Facebook, in the violence perpetrated in Myanmar.  In response to the report, Facebook announced Monday that it is banning 20 individuals and organizations from the platform, including Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and removing more than 50 Facebook pages, most of which were allegedly ""covertly push(ing) the messages of the Myanmar military.""  'Terrorist activities'  Once seen as a defender of human rights, Myanmar state counsellor Suu Kyi has been heavily criticized for her failure to act as the scale of the attacks against the Rohingya emerged.  Speaking on August 21 following a lecture in Singapore, Suu Kyi again reiterated the government's claim that ""terrorist activities"" remain a threat in Rakhine state that has to be addressed.  ""The danger of terrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine, remains real and present today. Unless this security challenge is addressed, the risk of inter-communal violence will remain,"" she said.  The refugees languishing in camps in Bangladesh are set to be sent home under a repatriation agreement made between Myanmar and Bangladesh. However, the timing of their return is uncertain.  Suu Kyi said last week that it was ""very difficult"" to put a time frame on the return of tens of thousands of Rohingyas, because the country has to work with Bangladesh to make it happen.  Mission chairman Darusman said Monday that the Myanmar government had not cooperated with the investigation or responded to the report, in its draft or published form.

China has culled more than 24,000 pigs in four provinces to stop the disease from proliferating, the FAO said in a statement. The first outbreak was reported in early August.  The FAO said the cases had been detected in areas more than 1,000km apart, meaning it could cross national borders.  The Ã¢â‚¬Å“diverse geographical spread of the outbreaks in China have raised fears that the disease will move across borders to neighbouring countries of South-East Asia or the Korean Peninsula where trade and consumption of pork products is also high,Ã¢â‚¬Â it added.  China reported its first case of the disease in north-east Liaoning province earlier this month.  Last week, the eastern city of Lianyungang announced it had culled 14,500 pigs in an attempt to check the diseaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spread.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The movement of pig products can spread diseases quickly and, as in this case of African swine fever, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likely that the movement of such products, rather than live pigs, has caused the spread of the virus to other parts,Ã¢â‚¬Â explained Juan Lubroth, FAOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chief veterinarian.  African swine fever is not harmful to humans but causes haemorrhagic fever in domesticated pigs and wild boar that almost always ends in death within a few days.  There is no antidote or vaccine, and the only known method to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of the infected livestock. Ã¢â‚¬â€ AFP",en,diseas,,

1976771,cnn,Susan Scutti,The dangers of eating raw fish,https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/30/health/raw-fish-vibrio-vulnificus-amputation/index.html,30/8/2018 0:00,31/8/2018 5:41,"(CNN) Raw fish, such as sushi, and other uncooked seafood may be delicious, but they also may be dangerous -- even life-threatening -- if prepared inexpertly.  Case in point: A 71-year old man in South Korea developed an infection after eating raw seafood, and resulting complications required an amputation of his forearm, according to a report published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The man had a history of Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, and he was undergoing dialysis for end-stage renal (kidney) disease. The illness developed within 12 hours of his meal and led to fever and excruciating pain in his left hand.  After two days of suffering, he visited the emergency room at Chonbuk National University Hospital in Jeonju, South Korea.  By the time he reached the hospital, a blood-filled cavity measuring 3.5 by 4.5 centimeters (about 1.5 by 2 inches) had developed on the palm of his left hand, while on the top of his hand and forearm, there was a swelling cavity under the skin.  When his doctors performed urgent surgery, they isolated Vibrio vulnificus , a bacterium commonly found in coastal ocean water, as the cause of his infection.  Vibrio vulnificus  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that these bacteria cause 205 infections each year nationwide. Some cases require amputations, and 15% to 30% of cases are fatal, according to the agency.  After surgery, the man received two powerful antibiotics intravenously. However, the drugs did not keep his skin lesions from worsening, and doctors performed an amputation of his left forearm 25 days after his arrival at the ER.  ""The patient did well after the surgery and was discharged home,"" the authors of his case report concluded.  The man's hand and arm were swollen by the time he reached the ER.  Vibrio vulnificus -- sometimes incorrectly referred to as ""flesh-eating bacteria"" -- is one of a family of 12 bacterial species that cause sickness in humans. Symptoms of these infections can include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Generally, these infections do not require treatment, and severe illness is rare, according to the CDC.  About 80% of infections happen between May and October, when coastal waters are warmest, and mostly they result from eating infected shellfish, with oysters a common culprit. Still, you can also become infected if bacteria in the water enter an open wound or cut, the CDC says.  Although the South Korean patient's amputation certainly ranks among the most hair-raising possibilities that can occur after you eat raw fish, other dangers lurk in raw or poorly cooked meals, as well.  Parasites  The growing popularity of sushi and other raw or undercooked fish and seafood dishes in Western countries has led to an increase in illness caused by anisakid nematodes (worms), according to a study published last year in BMJ Case Reports.  Anisakiasis results from eating fish or seafood contaminated with that parasite.  When the worms invade the stomach wall or intestines, the result is gastrointestinal pain, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Some people develop complications, including digestive bleeding, bowel obstruction and peritonitis (an inflammation of the inner wall of the abdomen). Other people may experience an allergic reaction, including swelling, skin rash or even anaphylaxis, which can cause difficulty breathing and loss of consciousness.  Anisakiasis cannot be transmitted from one person to another and is most common in Japan, where sushi is king. Japan sees, roughly, 3,000 cases annually, according to the authors of the case study.  However, in recent years, other parts of the globe have begun to see a rise in anisakiasis illness, according to the CDC, though the agency estimates that only a case or two are reported in the US each year.  Salmonella  Raw or undercooked fish may also harbor the most common food-poisoning bacteria, Salmonella, which causes about 1.2 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths in the US every year, according to the CDC. Food is the source of most of these illnesses. Although raw or undercooked fish is less likely to cause a salmonella infection than other foods, including chicken and beef, it still may carry these bacteria.

Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 21, from north London, was convicted last month of preparing acts of terrorism.  Rahman had planned to detonate a bomb at the gates of Downing Street and then kill Theresa May with a knife or gun.  Sentencing him, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Rahman ""would have carried out his attack"" had he not been arrested.  Rahman was captured by an undercover operation involving the Metropolitan Police, MI5 and FBI.  He was arrested moments after collecting a bag and jacket from an undercover operative that he believed had been fitted with explosives.  The judge said: ""I am sure that at all material times Rahman believed the devices to be real and capable of causing serious harm.""  He added that the undercover officers involved in the case were ""scrupulous"" at all times and Rahman was the ""instigator and author"" of his own actions.  How Rahman was caught  By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani  Rahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent.  That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures.  ""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players.  ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now.""  Read more from Dominic Casciani  Image copyright Met Police Image caption Undercover officers gave Rahman a fake bomb  Rahman, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said, had been ""told and believed"" that the rucksack bomb given to him was ""capable of causing casualties on a scale comparable to those caused at the Manchester Arena"", where 22 people were killed.  Rahman's lawyer argued he had been brainwashed by his uncle - who was later killed in a drone strike while fighting for the Islamic State group in Syria - and said his client had not intended to go through with the plot.  But a probation report read to the court by the judge revealed that Rahman had admitted in prison he would have carried out the attack had he been able to.  A pre-sentence report described him as a ""clever and cunning"" young man who had the potential to ""operate below the radar to dreadful effect"".

FILE PHOTO: A military vehicle drives along the Konduga-Bama road in Bama, Borno, Nigeria, August 31, 2016. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde/File Photo  ThursdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack by suspected members of Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), on a base in Zari village in the north of Borno State, is the latest blow to NigeriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to defeat Islamist insurgencies.  In 2016 ISWA split from Boko Haram, the jihadist group which has killed more than 30,000 people in the region since 2009, when it launched an insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate.  Military and security personnel who did not want to be named told Reuters on Saturday up to 30 soldiers had been killed in the Zari attack. Three such sources said late on Sunday and on Monday the known death toll of Nigerian troops had risen to 48.  Military spokesmen did not respond to phone calls and text messages from Reuters on Monday requesting comment.  Army spokesman Texas Chukwu told the state-run News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday there had been a firefight between troops and insurgents. But he called the reports of killings of soldiers a Ã¢â‚¬Å“figment of the imagination of the news agencyÃ¢â‚¬Â, without saying which news agency he meant.  Reports of killings of troops have been published by foreign news organisations including Reuters and by some Nigerian media.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“During the firefight, the overwhelming volume of fire was unleashed on the insurgents from both the air and ground troops, neutralising several of them and their weapons,Ã¢â‚¬Â Chukwu told NAN. He did not specifically say that no government troops had been killed.  President Muhammadu Buhari, a former general, won the 2015 election after vowing to crush Islamist militants. He plans to seek a second term in February.  Buhari said on Sunday Boko Haram were no longer in Borno state and did not control any territory, according to a presidency statement.

The latest case, the eighth since the virus was first reported in the country a month ago, was found in the city of Wuxi, the agriculture ministry said, two hours drive west of Shanghai in eastern China's Jiangsu province.

The new outbreak killed nine pigs and infected another 12 on a farm with 97 pigs, the ministry said.  It's not clear if the disease is spreading more quickly through the world's largest hog herd or if farmers are reporting outbreaks to authorities after a publicity blitz by the ministry.  At the weekend, the government said it will shut live hog markets in the affected provinces and imposed a ban on transporting pigs and pork products from the provinces, the most drastic measure taken so far, and one set to have major repercussions across the supply chain.

The three-day meeting led by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) brings together specialists in animal diseases as well as agricultural policy from nine countries neighbouring China.  China, the world's largest pork producer and consumer, reported its first case in August in northeastern Liaoning province. The disease has since spread south prompting a cull of 38,000 pigs.  African swine fever does not affect humans but causes haemorrhagic fever in pigs and wild boars that is nearly always fatal.  There is no antidote or vaccine, and the only known preventive measure is a mass cull of infected livestock.  ""It's critical that this region be ready for the very real possibility that ASF could jump the border into other countries,"" the FAO's Wantanee Kalpravidh said in a statement.

Dozens of children kick up the sand underneath their sandals.  Their shrieks echo as they roll their heads back in carefree laughter. They're playing, but not with toys or balls.  They are playing a game called ""Boko Haram versus soja (soldier)"".  They scamper around screaming, ""shoot!"", ramming their fingers into each other's bodies. Their pointed fingertips are supposed to be the barrels of rifles or blade of swords.  They are pretending to kill each other.  Some ""die"", falling over like felled trees.  One child collapses with his hand pressed over his heart as imaginary blood gushes out.  A tall boy jumps over the ""dead"" body and runs into another with a yellow t-shirt, who aims straight for his head.  ""Boom!"" the boy shouts, a gunshot.  This is playtime at a private primary school organised by a local NGO called Education Must Continue Initiative (EMCI) in Yola, the capital of Adamawa state in northeastern Nigeria.  All of the children are now displaced after fleeing their home communities to escape from Boko Haram.  'I saw Boko Haram chop my grandfather's head'  These children have seen the brutality of the armed group firsthand.  ""Boko Haram, I see them use knife, chop my grandfather's head,"" said Ibrahim Daniel, a 13-year-old boy from Gwoza in neighbouring Borno State.  Gwoza was, and is still, a notorious hideout for the fighters. Boko Haram captured the town of nearly 300,000, in August 2014, and declared it the headquarters of what it called its Islamic Caliphate.  The group's black flags were mounted around the town and underneath them, Boko Haram members executed anyone who failed to obey their rules, dumping corpses in wells and streams.  Hundreds hid in the Gwoza Hills, a set of rocky outcrops on the northeastern end of the volcanic Mandara Mountains that straddle the Nigerian-Cameroonian border.  The Nigerian army flushed Boko Haram out of Gwoza nine months later, but Daniel is still too afraid to go back.  ""The Boko Haram is something that you won't like to see,"" the young teenager says in a gruff voice.  Speaking in Nigerian slang English, he continues: ""I'd like to be a soldier because anything that them [Boko Haram] do, I'd like to do back to them. If me, I see them, me I go carry them. Me I kill am.""  The other kids huddle around Daniel, laughing at his last remark about killing Boko Haram. Many of them want to become soldiers, too.  They have seen the fighters invade their villages and they want revenge.  ""I can help government. I can help my parents with being soja,"" says Chinda John in the same slang, sitting beside Daniel.  Across the Lake Chad region, where Boko Haram's campaign is approaching its tenth year, a generation of young people are dreaming of becoming soldiers, nurturing their hopes of inflicting bloody vengeance on the group for its atrocities, which includes killing at least 30,000 people, kidnapping thousands and setting ablaze untold numbers of villages.  Operating on its manifesto that condemns Western education, Boko Haram has destroyed nearly 1,400 Western-style schools, killed more than 2,000 teachers and caused $9bn worth of destruction.  The transnational group carries out attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Chad and in the islands on Lake Chad. A faction of the group boasts of an affiliation with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).  Dreams of being a soldier  The growing thirst for revenge from children worries Rebecca Gadzama, the cofounder of EMCI.  She launched the NGO with her husband in the wake of the February 2014 Chibok Girls abduction. Reaching more than 1,600 children. EMCI has set up two schools for internally displaced children and partners with six existing schools in central Nigeria.  She stops by to visit the EMCI school in Yola, entering a math class where Daniel, John and other students are learning about ratios. When she walks into the classroom everyone stands up.  ""Good morning, grandmother,"" they say in unison.  ""How are you?"" Gadzama replies.  She stands in the doorframe and asks how they're doing, and how many of them want to become doctors. One student raises his hand.  ""Who wants to be an economist? I am one,"" she asks. No one raises a hand.  ""Who wants to be a soldier?""  Most of the students in the classroom raise their hand while giggling.  Gadzama lifts her head, looking around the room. Then she speaks again, gently yet firm.  ""Before you grow up, you need to learn that even if you kill Boko Haram, will it bring back what you lost? Will it change what has happened to you? How many lost their parents to Boko Haram? How many people lost their loved ones?"" she asks the children.  Everyone looks around. The room buzzes with tension. One by one, hands go up, one in the rear, another by the window, the kid sitting by the teacher, also.  'They need psycho-social support'  Boko Haram's campaign has had an acute impact on children.  Some of the nine-year-old students have been hearing the words Boko Haram ever since they were born.  Out of the 2.6 million people who fled their homes in fear of Boko Haram, 1.4 million of them were children, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).  The agency also reports that nearly one out of four suicide bombers is a child.  For many children in the area, fear is a daily part of their lives. But the fear is often hidden under complex emotional layers.  ""Some children are very shy,"" said Marzia Vigliaroni from the Italian organisation Cooperazione Internazionale. The group partnered with UNICEF in Niger to help rehabilitate local communities attacked by Boko Haram. ""They won't speak or participate in our activities; they need psychosocial support.""  Apart from dreaming of killing Boko Haram, children draw pictures of them, too.  In a 2015 UNICEF report called Missing Childhoods, Vigliaroni said: ""We ask them to make drawings of their experience during the attack. They draw people with slit throats and people drowning in the river.""  Danladi Saleh, a medical doctor from Chibok where Boko Haram carried out its most infamous kidnapping, said many children see the violence as something fun that they want to be a part of.  ""With gunshots and explosions, naturally you will find people running away and hiding but I have observed children in this part of Nigeria running with joy and jubilation towards it, the violence. It is highly abnormal. They want to see the explosion; they want to see Boko Haram; they want to see the fight. So the whole thing is fun for them,"" Saleh explains to Al Jazeera.  For years, Saleh has helped to coordinate psychosocial counselling in the area.  When a volunteer counter-Boko Haram civilian group called the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) emerged in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri - where Boko Haram began - in 2013, adolescents eagerly joined. Amateur videos of CJTF operations showed adolescents and teenagers beating people with guns.  Saleh said he remembers what he saw on the day when the CFTF had successfully repelled Boko Haram when the fighters tried to enter Maiduguri.  ""You can see a child who looked to be 12 years old carrying the head of a Boko Haram member, the head of a human being, a Boko Haram member,"" Saleh explains. ""Imagine the future of a child who is carrying a human head and the psychological impact of that child. What will his future look like?""  The CJTF signed an agreement with UNICEF in 2017 to prevent children from participating.  Rehabilitation, psychosocial support and de-radicalisation programmes are cropping up, but mental trauma is often misunderstood, particularly in children.  It is not an issue of fighting back. It's an issue of how do we get over this? How do we become one again because some of the guys in the Boko Haram are also children. When will it stop?"" Rebecca Gadzama, cofounder of Education Must Continue Initiative  Nigeria's war against Boko Haram continues with no end in the near future. In recent weeks, the fighters have killed Nigerian security forces and stolen military equipment. But the government has downplayed these incidents, opting to present stories of military might and success against Boko Haram.  In this false narrative, children are growing up believing that being a soldier means being invincible, observers have noted.  Back in Yola, Gadzama winces at the sight of students wielding imaginary guns and throwing bombs.  ""It is not an issue of fighting back. It's an issue of how do we get over this? How do we become one again because [some of] the guys in the Boko Haram are also children,"" Gadzama says. ""When will it stop?""    ",en,terrorattack,,

Britain has called the meeting to update council members on the investigation into the attempted murder of former spy Sergei Skripal, his daughter Yulia and police officer Nick Bailey.  It comes a day after two men suspected of being Russian spies were named as the prime suspects in the Salisbury attack.  Prime Minster Theresa May said Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were Russian intelligence officers and the attack had been approved ""at a senior level of the Russian state"".  :: LIVE - Putin 'bears very strong responsibility'  Image: Ruslan Boshirov (left) and Alexander Petrov were named as suspects  0:45 Video: 'We were right to say Russia was responsible'  But a spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry said the names of the men and their photos ""say nothing to us"".  The Kremlin has denied any role in the poisoning of the Skirpals, who were found slumped on a park bench after being exposed to the military nerve agent on 4 March.  Speaking in the House of Commons, Mrs May said based on ""a body of intelligence"" the government had concluded suspects Petrov and Boshirov were officers from the Russian intelligence agency GRU.  ""The GRU is a highly disciplined organisation with a well-established chain of command,"" she said.  :: How the Wiltshire novichok poisonings unfolded  Image: Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned in Salisbury on 4 March  ""So this was not a rogue operation... It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state.""  She told MPs that the UK would push for new sanctions against Russians responsible for cyberattacks and additional listings under the existing regime.  She also promised to work with the UK's intelligence allies to ""counter the threat posed by the GRU"".  Image: Before the attack, Petrov is seen at Gatwick Airport on 2 March  Image: CCTV shows Boshirov at Gatwick Airport on the same day  :: Remote chance Salisbury suspects will face justice despite Interpol red notice  The two suspects, who are both believed to be around 40, are likely to have been travelling under aliases, police said.  Detectives believe the novichok was smuggled into the UK in a fake, specially adapted Nina Ricci perfume bottle before it was applied to the front door of Mr Skripal's house.  Image: The perfume bottle that contained the novichok  CCTV images showed the movements of Petrov and Boshirov after they arrived into Gatwick Airport on a flight from Russia on 2 March.  The men stayed at a hotel in east London before travelling to Salisbury on 3 March for a ""reconnaissance"" of the area, the Metropolitan Police said.  :: Moscow to Salisbury: Novichok attack suspects' movements revealed  Image: Both suspects at Salisbury train station a day before the Skripals were poisoned  Image: Boshirov and Petrov on the day of the attack  The suspects returned to Salisbury a day later and were spotted near Mr Skripal's house.  They boarded a flight from Heathrow Airport to Moscow that evening.  Police revealed tests showed traces of novichok in the room at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London, where Petrov and Boshirov had stayed.  Image: The CityStay hotel where the suspects stayed  England's chief medical officer said anyone who stayed at the hotel between 4 March and 4 May should contact the investigation team.  A spokesman for the hotel said it was ""open for business as usual"" and had been ""fully supporting the police investigation"".  0:31 Video: Novichok hotel 'open for business'  The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to charge Petrov and Boshirov with the attempted murder of Mr Skirpal, his daughter Yulia and Mr Bailey.  The suspects also face charges of conspiracy to murder Mr Skripal, the use and possession of novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act, and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Ms Skripal and Mr Bailey.  0:57 Video: How does novichok affect the body?  A European arrest warrant has been obtained but the CPS said it will not be applying to Russia for extradition, as the country does not extradite its own nationals.  Met Police assistant commissioner Neil Basu said officers had linked the Salisbury attack to the incident four months later in nearby Amesbury, which saw Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, poisoned.  Ms Sturgess died on 8 July, days after she was taken to hospital. She was exposed to the same nerve agent used on the Skripals in Salisbury.  Image: Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess were poisoned in July  ""We do not believe Dawn and Charlie were deliberately targeted, but became victims as a result of the recklessness in which such a toxic nerve agent was disposed of,"" Mr Basu said.  The UK summoned a Russian diplomat in London on Wednesday to stress that those responsible for the poisoning must be brought to justice, the PM's spokesman said.",en,terrorattack,,
2011240,cnn,Gayle Tzemach Lemmon,The future for peace in Afghanistan is much brighter (opinion),http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/fWD3WJqqoLw/index.html,,8/9/2018 5:15,"Gayle Tzemach Lemmon is an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. She is the author of ""The Dressmaker of Khair Khana"" and ""Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) Afghanistan, a nation that has seen so much, has borne a great deal in recent months. Pilots assassinated . Midwives attacked . Journalists blown up . Young people murdered while trying to study.  And today, more tears, as 20 people were killed in a suicide attack. They were murdered while watching a wrestling match. And, not long afterward, journalists reporting on the incident were killed in a second, back-to-back attack.  The senseless carnage comes as leaders from the United States and Afghanistan say enough is enough. They are pointing toward those they claim are backing the Taliban as they seek to bring an end to three decades of fighting in Afghanistan.  ""It is time for this war in Afghanistan to end,"" said US Gen. John Nicholson in his last speech as commander of US military in Afghanistan this past week. ""President [Ashraf] Ghani's courageous decision to announce a ceasefire [between the Afghan government and the Taliban] over Eid al-Fitr unleashed a strong call in the Afghan people for peace.""  Continued Nicholson, ""You don't need to keep killing your fellow Afghans. You don't need to keep killing your fellow Muslims. The time for peace is now."" He then added, ""Whose voice is more important: the outsiders who are encouraging you to fight, or the voice of your own people who are encouraging you to peace?""  And, indeed, the Afghan people are making their voices known. Momentum is building across sectors -- political, military and civil society -- to work toward achieving some kind of end to a seemingly endless war.  Women are at the center of that push for an Afghanistan whose future looks different from its past -- one that holds those backing the Taliban accountable, while charting a way ahead that includes the entire population, not just half.  Recently, female activists spent days poring over a letter they wrote that urges the United Nations to take an active role in stopping the violence. They also asked the UN to investigate those who are funding the violence that the Taliban continues to perpetuate.  ""In light of the latest wave of increased violence and targeted killing of innocent civilians across Afghanistan, we women of Afghanistan are writing to urge the United Nations Security Council's (UNSC) members to stand in unity with Afghans and take a strong stance to hold accountable states who are in a way affiliated with, or supporting, aiding and abetting terrorist groups that are waging war against innocent Afghan civilians, especially women and children,"" said the letter written by nearly two dozen organizations and individuals. ""We know there are regional interests and proxies going on in Afghanistan for whom our lives do not matter.""  And these women are not new to the fight; they have been working for years on girls' education, the fight to stop violence against women and the battle for women's political representation in Afghanistan.  They are part of the chorus that is speaking up to say enough is enough. The din of voices is not enough in itself to stop the violence. But perhaps public outrage will prove one part of pushing the Taliban and their backers to the peace table.  As the Taliban have shown, they can overrun cities and launch ever more brazen attacks. And we still don't know whether the three-day ceasefire between the Taliban and the government in Kabul this past June was the start of a broader push for peace or a fleeting moment of pause in the fighting before more carnage comes.  There are, however, signs that current battlefield realities plus war weariness among the Afghan public -- alongside the threat of an emergent ISIS in Afghanistan -- may help bring a change for which Afghans have thirsted for decades.  And some Taliban fighters seem to be signaling that an opening for an end to the fight may exist. ""We have lost many young Afghans. We have orphans, we have widows -- if people from government die, they are Afghans. If Taliban die, they are Afghans,"" said Mullah Sher Agha, a Taliban commander who responded to CNN questions about peace talks.  Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Whether his sentiments will be echoed, and whether regional powers will support them, remains to be seen. What is clear is that a chorus of voices from across the lanes of civil society, the political sphere and the military is growing louder -- speaking up, talking peace and asking neighbors to help -- or, at the least, not hinder them in bringing an end to the war.",en,terrorattack,,

Russia's ambassador to the UN met Haley's threat with a denial that Syria has any chemical weapons, as the UN secretary-general warned of a potential ""bloodbath"" during Tuesday's UN Security Council meeting on the crisis in Idlib, Syria.  During what was the second session on Idlib in four days, Haley told the council that ""the world has seen a clear military escalation"" this month by Russia and the Syrian regime, whose forces have conducted more than 100 airstrikes, using ""barrel bombs, rockets and artillery"" in an attempt to retake the last rebel holdout after more than seven years of war.  Haley accused Russia and Iran of having little interest in a political solution and called their actions those of ""cowards interested in a bloody military conquest.""  ""If Assad, Russia and Iran continue down the path they are on, the consequences will be dire,"" she said.  ""I also want to reiterate what I said last week to the Assad regime and anyone else contemplating the use of chemical weapons in Syria,"" Haley added.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis declined to say Tuesday whether the US would take military action against the Syrian regime should it use chemical weapons, but he did say Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad has ""been warned.""  ""I'm not going to tell the world ahead of time what we're going to do. It's just not my style,"" Mattis said when asked if and what kind of retaliation the US military would carry out should the regime use chemical weapons in its offensive against Idlib.  ""I never talk about what would come next,"" Mattis said. ""But I think that you do have to look at the fact that we will abide by the chemical weapons prohibition and support it.""  When asked what the US has done to prevent their use, Mattis referred to US, UK and French strikes on Syria after a chemical weapons attack in April. Assad ""has been warned,"" Mattis said. ""The first time around he lost 17% of his pointy-nosed air force airplanes. He's been warned. And so we'll see if he's wised up.""  'A humanitarian nightmare'  Mattis declined to confirm whether he has been in consultations with the UK or France on any military response.  The crisis in Idlib has the potential to ""unleash a humanitarian nightmare unlike any seen in the blood-soaked Syrian conflict,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday, noting that there are close to 1 million children in Idlib, part of the wave of internally displaced Syrians who fled there to escape violence elsewhere. ""Idlib is the last so-called 'de-escalation zone' in Syria,"" Guterres said. ""It must not be transformed into a bloodbath.""  The Russian and Syrian strikes have already displaced more than 30,000 people, and forces are targeting hospitals and other medical facilities, Haley said, adding that pro-regime forces are also ""conducting ruthless 'double tap strikes' on civilian volunteers like the White Helmets,"" in which they ""strike an area, wait a few moments for first responders to arrive and then strike again.""  ""The United States is long past taking Russia and Iran at their word that they are genuinely interested in protecting civilians in Idlib from further violence,"" Haley said. ""No matter what type of weapons or methods are used, the United States strongly opposes any escalation of violence in Idlib.""  No absolution  During his remarks, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia repeated the claim that ""Syria has no chemical weapons,"" and said it would be folly on a humanitarian and political basis for the Assad regime to use chemical weapons, as it would prompt the US and others to attack inside Syria.  He also blamed terrorists for forcing the government to move on Idlib, a claim rejected by the US and other nations, which argue that Russia and the Assad regime are using that label to justify the military offensive.  ""Fighting terrorism does not absolve warring parties of their core obligations under international law,"" said Guterres, who directly appealed to Iran, Russia and Turkey to spare no effort to protect civilians, ""preserve basic services such as hospitals, ensure full respect for international humanitarian law.""  CNN reported last week that US officials have grown worried that an assault on Idlib could involve the use of chemical weapons if the rebels are able to slow regime advances.  The Assad regime has moved armed helicopters closer to Idlib in recent weeks, according to two defense officials. The US is concerned they could eventually be used to launch another chemical attack as well as a conventional assault.  Nebenzia, the Russian diplomat, also summed up last week's summit among Russia, Turkey and Iran as ""a major milestone in restoring peace and ensuring lasting settlement in Syria."" The three countries had failed to reach an agreement for a ceasefire, however, prompting Sweden and other nations to again warn of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" should the Syria government, backed by Russia, wage a military offensive on Idlib, where millions are at risk.  Haley said the failed summit was another indication that Russia, Iran and the Assad regime are not interested in a political solution, telling the council that those parties have ""had every opportunity to demonstrate their credibility as constructive actors in Syria.""  ""Russia, Iran and Assad are demolishing Idlib and asking us to call it peace,"" she said. ""We will know that the Assad regime and its enablers are serious about a political process for peace in Syria not when they repeat their empty promises, but when they act.""",en,terrorattack,496,"['Russia', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Iran', 'Syria']"

Ground forces with the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) began the offensive on Monday night, advancing toward the town of Hajin on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River aided by US airstrikes, US and SDF officials said.  Hajin is the largest town in an approximately 95-square-mile stretch of mostly desert terrain along the river's east bank. The conquest of this territory would mark an effective end to ISIS' so-called caliphate, which at its peak in 2014-2015 spanned vast areas of Syria and Iraq.  The battle, however, won't however spell an end to the threat posed by the militants, who are already regrouping in pockets of territory in Iraq and also maintain cells scattered across the vast desert area to the west of the Euphrates, which is under Syrian government control.  US military officials say they are anticipating a tough fight for the Hajin area, which has served as the final retreat for ISIS fighters who chose not to surrender or flee earlier battles. US and SDF estimates put their number at between 1,500 and 2,500, out of an army that may have numbered as much as 100,000 at the height of the group's prowess.  But they include the toughest and most ideologically committed militants of the entire war, with experience gained in battles such as Mosul and Raqqa.  They are unlikely to give up easily, said Colonel Sean Ryan, a US military spokesman in Baghdad. The militants have laced the area with underground tunnels, riddled it with explosive devices and are expected to launch multiple suicide attacks against their attackers rather than submit.  ""We're thinking it's going to be a very difficult battle, and it's not going to be a quick one,"" Ryan said. He would not put a timeline on the fight but said it is not expected to continue past the end of the year.  ""They're going to fight to the end and it's going to be tough,"" he said.  Kino Gabriel, a spokesman for the SDF forces, which will bear the brunt of the ground fighting, said many foreign fighters are among those making a last stand in the Hajin pocket.  It has also been widely speculated that the town, or one of the surrounding villages, could be the hiding place of top ISIS officials, including perhaps their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis said Tuesday that he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if some ISIS leaders were in the Hajin area.  But, Gabriel said, it is more likely that Baghdadi has already escaped the US-led coalition's dragnet and is taking refuge in one of the other pockets of terrain loosely controlled by ISIS.  ""There is a possibility that Baghdadi is in that area, but there are a lot of areas in both Syria and Iraq that he could be hidden in. I don't think he would allow himself to be surrounded from all sides,"" he said.  The offensive in eastern Syria comes at a time when international attention has been focused elsewhere in the country - on Idlib province in the northwest, where Syrian government forces are massing for a possible assault on a rebel stronghold.  The offensive for Hajin, code name Operation Roundup, has been months in the making. It comes after Trump administration officials put an end to the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the northeastern Syrian enclave controlled by the SDF by declaring that US troops would stay there indefinitely.  The United States maintains about 2,000 troops in northeastern Syria, across an area amounting to more than a quarter of the country.  They were dispatched there to aid in the fight against ISIS and in the process facilitated the expansion of the Kurdish-dominated SDF into vast areas of mostly Arab-populated territory.  The withdrawal of the troops would have left the area vulnerable to the ambitions of the Syrian government to reclaim all of the territory it lost after the uprising against President Bashar al Assad in 2011.  But earlier this month, Trump administration officials said they had switched course, and that US troops will remain indefinitely in the area, pending an overall solution to the Syrian war, both to ensure that ISIS doesn't return and that Iran doesn't expand its influence there.",en,terrorattack,494,['Syria']

FILE PHOTO - Labels of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are seen iside a damaged house in Douma in Damascus, Syria April 23, 2018. REUTERS/ Ali Hashisho  The attacks caused injuries in the Damascus suburb of Douma and in Idlib in the northwest in January and early February, they said in their latest report.  They said they were still investigating a suspected chemical attack in Douma on April 7 that killed at least 49 people and wounded up to 650.  The United Nations has warned of a potential humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, if an expected offensive is carried out by the Syrian government and its allied Russian forces.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Commission of Inquiry demands that all parties to the conflict and those states who support them do everything in their power to prevent a massacre in Idlib,Ã¢â‚¬Â the war crimes investigators said in a statement read out by panel chairman Paulo Pinheiro to a news conference.  They had no information that chemical agents might be used against the 2.9 million civilians living in Idlib, half of them refugees from elsewhere in Syria. The pocket is controlled by tens of thousands of rebel fighters, including around 10,000 Islamists designated as terrorists by the world body.  However, the three new cases bring to 33 the number of chemical attacks that the independent panel has documented since 2013 and attributed to the government, a U.N. official said. The use of chlorine in Douma on April 7, for which Western powers have blamed Syria, came as the government and its allies were in a final push to drive rebels out of the eastern Ghouta region.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“MUCH STRONGER RESPONSEÃ¢â‚¬Â  John Bolton, U.S. President Donald TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s national security adviser, said on Monday that the United States, Britain and France had agreed that another use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would result in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“much stronger responseÃ¢â‚¬Â than previous such incidents.  The April attack resulted in U.S., British and French missile strikes on sites believed to be linked to SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chemical weapons programme.  Pinheiro said the latest reports of air strikes on rebel-held areas of Idlib followed a previous pattern of Ã¢â‚¬Å“targeting civilian infrastructure and medical facilitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â:  Ã¢â‚¬Å“For months we have been saying this concentration of population and armed groups transported or transferred to Idlib was a (time) bomb.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Chlorine was dropped by government helicopters in Saraqeb in Idlib on Feb. 4, injuring at least 11 men, the report said, while women and children were injured in the Jan. 22 and Feb. 1 attacks on Douma.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Commission concludes that, on these two occasions, government forces and/or affiliated militias committed the war crimes of using prohibited weapons and launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian-populated areas in eastern Ghouta,Ã¢â‚¬Â it said.  The use of chlorine as a weapon is prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention.  In addition to the 33 uses of chlorine weapons attributed to the government, the perpetrators of six others have not been sufficiently identified.  On the April 7 attack, the panel said the evidence so far pointed to a gas cylinder dropped by helicopter having struck a residential apartment building.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Zimbabwe Republic Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba asked residents to ""take heed"" of the ruling, which came after health officials identified more than 3,000 suspected cases of the waterborne disease.  ""The government has declared the cholera outbreak in Harare a state of emergency, meaning that it is also a threat to human security,"" Charamba said.  Outbreaks of cholera occur regularly in Zimbabwe because of dilapidated water and sanitation facilities. Informal housing areas without running water have mushroomed and basic infrastructure has collapsed after years of neglect.  Examination of water samples from some wells and boreholes in Harare, home to swathes of slum-like housing, tested positive for contamination with the disease.  On Tuesday, Health Minister Obadiah Moyo declared a state of emergency in the city. ""The number of cases are growing by the day,"" he said, adding the outbreak was caused by ""blocked sewers"".  Preventable disease  Cholera, which can kill within hours if untreated, is caused by the consumption of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.  According to the World Health Organization, it is ""easily treatable"" and even preventable if there is ""universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation"".  More than 4,000 people were killed by the disease during an outbreak in Zimbabwe a decade ago.  Newly installed President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who has pledged to revive Zimbabwe's ailing economy and improve public services, said officials were working to ""contain and overcome"" the most recent outbreak.  ""I urge all residents of affected areas to exercise extra care with their hygiene & follow the instructions of the authorities,"" Mnangagwa said in a Twitter post on Wednesday.  I urge all residents of affected areas to exercise extra care with their hygiene & follow the instructions of the authorities as we seek to contain & overcome this outbreak. We are working tirelessly to control the situation and hope to communicate progress in due course (2/2) Ã¢â‚¬â€ President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) September 12, 2018  'No lessons learned'  Under former leader Robert Mugabe, who was in power from Zimbabwe's independence in 1980 until being removed from office by the military late last year, corruption and economic mismanagement were endemic.  The United Nations Human Development Index - which measures health, education and economic performance - ranks Zimbabwe 154 out of 188 countries.  Amnesty International said the country's most recent outbreak of cholera was a consequence of its ""failure to invest in and manage both its basic water and sanitation infrastructure and its healthcare system"".  ""It is appalling that in 2018 people are still dying of such a preventable disease,"" Jessia Pwiti, Amnesty's executive director for Zimbabwe, said in a statement on Wednesday.  ""No lessons were learned from the 2008 epidemic and the outbreak and deaths we're seeing now is symptomatic of a still broken-down sanitation infrastructure and poor sewer management, worsened by a shortage of drugs and medical supplies,"" she added.  Last month, 47 African countries committed to end cholera outbreaks by 2030 at a WHO Regional Committee for Africa summit in Senegal's capital, Dakar.  ""Cholera is a symbol of inequity. It's an ancient disease, which has been eliminated in many parts of the world. Every death from cholera is preventable,"" Matshidiso Moeti, WHO director for Africa, said.  In 2017, more than 150,000 cholera cases were reported in 17 countries throughout Africa, according to the WHO.",en,diseas,,

BRUSSELS/PARIS: Belgium has confirmed an outbreak of African swine fever, marking a further spread of the disease that has hit farms in Eastern Europe and China and which could now threaten Western Europe's large pig industry.  Belgium's food safety agency on Thursday said that African swine fever (ASF) had been detected in the Etalle district near the French border, after the death of several wild boars raised suspicions that the virus was present.  Advertisement  This is the first reported case of the disease in Belgium since 1985.  Western European countries have been trying to avert the spread of the disease, which is highly contagious among pigs and difficult to eradicate, after a growing number of cases in Eastern Europe, including in EU members such as Romania.  The European Commission said it will deploy a team of experts this weekend to coordinate with Belgian authorities over the swine fever cases and the EU health commissioner will meet ministers of Belgian regions Wallonia and Flanders on Monday.  One Flemish farmers' group, ABS, called for the cull of wild boars to protect farm pigs, while Wallonia's agriculture ministry said it has banned hunting in a 63,000 hectare-wide (155,676 acre) area to prevent wild boars from spreading out.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""The Belgian authorities announced yesterday two isolated cases of African swine fever in two wild boars found dead in the forest in the region of Etalle,"" a Commission spokeswoman told a news conference in Brussels, adding the EU executive was in close contact with Belgian authorities.  ""PANDEMIC PROPORTIONS""  France's agriculture ministry announced reinforced surveillance in four administrative departments (counties) bordering Belgium and extra measures to protect pig farms and slaughterhouses.  ""This new outbreak represents the expansion of the disease, for the first time during the current pandemic, into Western Europe,"" said Paul Sundberg, executive director of the Swine Health Information Center in the United States.  ""This new outbreak may represent a new change in the epidemiologic situation of ASF worldwide, suggesting that the disease may have reached pandemic proportions.""  The spread of the virus has already led to the slaughtering of hundreds of thousands of pigs in Eastern Europe, while in China, the world's biggest pork producer, a series of cases since August has led to measures including a ban on transporting animals and feeding food waste to pigs in affected provinces.  The EU is collectively the world's second-largest pigmeat producer after China and the largest exporter, with most of its pork industry concentrated in Germany, Denmark, France and Spain.  Germany earlier this year issued a decree to allow hunters to shoot wild boar year-round to stop the animals, which can carry African swine fever, from passing the deadly infection on to farm pigs.  Experts say the virus can also be spread through food products and by people, even though it is not harmful to humans. There is no vaccine or treatment for it.  The most recent cases in Europe could be linked to food thrown away by people who had travelled from zones where the disease is present, Belgium's food safety agency said in its statement.  ""When you start to have cases at quite some distance from previously reported ones there is concern for everyone,"" Justin Sherrard, global strategist, animal protein, at Rabobank, said.

The jet was shot down by a Soviet-made missile over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in July 2014, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Russian border, where fighting had been raging for months between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.  The Netherlands and Australia announced in May that they believe the missile was transported to Ukraine from a military unit in the Russian city of Kursk.  Russia has vehemently denied involvement and has over the years come up with various theories as to the cause of the crash, generally laying the blame on the Ukrainian side.  Lt. Gen. Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Missile and Artillery Directorate at the Russian Defense Ministry, told reporters on Monday that the military had studied and declassified archives at the research center outside Moscow that produced the Buk missiles after the Dutch investigators displayed parts of the missile and their serial numbers. Parshin said the Russian archives show that the missile that was made of these parts was transported to a military unit in western Ukraine in 1986, and to Russia's knowledge never left Ukraine.  Asked about the possibility that the separatists may have seized the missile system during fighting in 2014, Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov conceded that Russia does not have any documents proving otherwise but pointed to the statements of Ukrainian officials who have denied that separatists seized any of their Buks.  The separatists in the weeks prior to the plane crash bragged on social media about shooting down Ukrainian military aircraft. On the day that MH17 crashed, a rebel commander posted that his troops had shot down a Ukrainian military plane. He later said his account has been hacked and that the rebels did not shoot down any aircraft that day.  A highly placed rebel, speaking to the AP shortly after the crash, admitted that rebels were responsible. The rebels believed they were targeting a Ukrainian military plane, the person said. He did not speculate, however, on a possible role of the Russian military in the attack.  The Russian military did provide material assistance to the rebels, and journalists sighted sophisticated weapons in the separatist-controlled areas that were never in Ukraine's arsenals.  Oleksandr Turchynov, secretary of Ukraine's Security and Defense Council, said on Monday that Russia's claim is ""yet another failed fake report that the Kremlin made up in order to cover up their crime that has been proven by the official investigation as well as independent experts.""  __  Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report from Kiev, Ukraine.",en,terrorattack,,

An emergency has been declared and public gatherings banned in the capital, Harare.  Large plastic tents dot the clinic grounds. Health workers, some in yellow protective clothing and white plastic gloves, move between them.  A child is crying inside one tent. Another bears a handwritten sign: ""Morgue"".  It is an eerie reminder that Harare's old enemy is back, and it is stalking the weak and the vulnerable.  Men, women and children lie in other makeshift wards, some linked to rehydration drips.  Each stretcher bed has two buckets - one positioned beneath a hole in the bed for diarrhoea, the other to the side of the bed for vomit.  Image caption Most victims die from dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhoea  Cholera is a tragic, dehumanising disease.  An outbreak of the waterborne disease was confirmed by authorities in early September, killing five people and infecting dozens more.  Within weeks, the death toll had risen to 28 with more than 5,000 reported cases of infection.  Most victims die from dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhoea. Many here believe these deaths could have been avoided.  'Odd, salty taste'  Inside one of the hot tents, 42-year-old builder Zvidzai Chikava tells me he has been here for two days.  His daughter has been transferred to a hospital where most serious cases are being attended to. He believes they both contracted cholera by drinking water from a shallow well dug outside their home.  Sat opposite him is Paul Sibanda, a builder who says he and four other people in his home have contracted the disease.  Image caption Paul Sibanda is one of five people in his home to have contracted cholera  ""We almost always drink tap water,"" he says. ""But often when you leave it in a container, there is a substance at the bottom.  ""Sometimes it has an odd, salty taste. But we drank it and never thought to treat or boil it.""  What is cholera?  Image copyright AFP  Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated  It kills up to 143,000 people worldwide each year, researchers estimate  Most people infected with cholera have no or mild symptoms, and can be successfully treated with an oral rehydration solution  Severe cases need swift treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics  Having access to safe water and sanitation is critical in controlling the transmission of cholera and other waterborne diseases  (Source: World Health Organization)  One day last week, 200 people received treatment at the clinic in the Harare suburb of Glen View. Glen View and Budiriro are the two areas worst affected - both are poor and overcrowded.  This outbreak is the first major one in a decade, but it pales in comparison to the previous one.  Between August 2008 and July 2009, some 4,200 people died from cholera according to the World Health Organization. It says 98,000 others were infected.  'The stench of sewage'  Questions are still being asked 10 years on about why a preventable disease keeps recurring.  The answer is evident during a quick tour of the affected suburbs.  Dotted around Glen View, you hear and see gurgling streams of what looks like water. But the stench is a giveaway that this is in fact waste from burst and blocked sewage pipes.  Stagnant pools of sewage have been allowed to collect in front of homes. Children play nearby.  Health authorities say that blocked sewers left unattended have contaminated water supplies.  Image caption Zimbabwe's decaying infrastructure has been blamed for the spread of cholera  Health Minister Obadiah Moyo blames the opposition-run city council for the crisis. He says the blocked pipes were reported months ago but never fixed.  ""As the health ministry we will not allow the city to sit on the their laurels,"" he told reporters after touring a health facility.  But the problem runs deeper.  For years, refuse collection has been erratic with mounds piling up around most of Harare. Tap water supplies have also been unpredictable.  It has forced citizens to dig their own shallow wells and boreholes. Many of these have since tested positive for cholera.  The water infrastructure has been left to decay for decades. Water pipes are cracked, rotting and need to be replaced.  More about life in Zimbabwe:  Image copyright AFP  As a stop-gap measure, the new finance minister Mthuli Ncube has created an emergency crowdfunding campaign to fight the disease.  Some hail it as an innovative model to help overcome Zimbabwe's many challenges. Many others believe it is an admission of failure from a government which they say has misplaced priorities.  Double blow  They point to the government's reported budget of $20m (Ã‚Â£15m) worth of loans earmarked for new luxury vehicles for ministers.  As the blame-shifting continues, cholera rages on challenging President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government.  It is one of his biggest crises since coming into power last November and the outbreak leaves a dent in his efforts to attract investors.  An international book fair has already been cancelled, while vendors are being moved from the streets in a politically sensitive and potentially volatile move.  The International Committee of the Red Cross describes the situation as incredibly complex. A double blow, as most of the areas affected had already been battling typhoid - another waterborne disease.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Drips are vital to prevent cholera patients from dehydrating  Fixing the water system will mean fixing the economy first, following years of economic decline under former President Robert Mugabe.  Zimbabwe spends more than 80% of its revenue on civil servants' salaries, leaving little left for anything else.  The Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ) estimates that the country needs to invest $26bn (Ã‚Â£20bn) over a period of 10 years to upgrade its infrastructure.  This is money the country does not have, and it is unable to borrow it from the IMF or World Bank until it settles its arrears.  Already businesses and churches have stepped in to try and stem the crisis, by paying for water deliveries, buckets and water treatment tablets.  But without a long-term plan, financial investment and above all political will, this preventable disease will return again and again to claim more victims.",en,diseas,,

Russian state media said Syrian missiles shot the maritime patrol aircraft down amid an attack by Israeli jets in the Latakia region of northwest Syria.  Moscow blamed Israel for putting its aircraft in the line of fire and said it had only a minute's notice of the strike.  ""As a result of the irresponsible actions of the Israeli military, 15 Russian servicemen were killed, which is absolutely not in keeping with the spirit of Russian-Israeli partnership,"" said Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, spokesperson for the Russian military, according to RIA-Novosti.  In a rare acknowledgment of its military activity in the region, Israel expressed ""sorrow"" for the loss of Russian life, but blamed the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. The Israeli Defense Forces said it had followed well-established protocols in communicating with Moscow, which are intended to prevent such incidents.  ""Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident,"" the IDF said in a statement, adding that Iran and Hezbollah were also accountable.  According to the statement, Syrian antiaircraft batteries ""fired indiscriminately and from what we understand did not bother to ensure no Russian planes were in the air.""  The incident presents Moscow with a diplomatic conundrum, as the country has a strong relationship with both Israel and the Syrian regime.  On Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin called the incident a tragedy and said that Russia will concentrate on taking additional security measures to ""protect our servicemen and our assets in Syria.""  ""Here it's more like a chain of tragic accidental circumstances, because Israel didn't shoot our plane down. But there's no doubt, no doubt at all, that we will have to take a serious look at what in fact happened, and our view of this tragedy is set out in the statement issued by the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, which has been fully agreed with me,"" Putin said.  In a phone conversation with Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed ""the importance of the continuation of security coordination between Israel and Russia, that has succeeded in preventing many losses on both sides in the past three years,"" according to a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office.  Netanyahu promised that Israel would transfer all relevant information about the incident to Russia and proposed sending the Commander of the Israeli Air Force to Moscow to personally hand over the information.  Earlier in the day Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman talked by phone with his Russian counterpart, Army Gen. Sergei Shoigu, both sides said. According to a readout of the call from the Russian Ministry of Defense, Shoigu described the actions of the Israeli air force as irresponsible and told Liberman that fault ""rests entirely with the Israeli side.""  ""We reserve the right for further reciprocal steps,"" Shoigu said, according to the readout.  At a press conference Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said it was his understanding that Syria was responsible for the incident.  ""That's not a good situation,"" Trump said at a press conference, noting reports were still preliminary. He called it a ""very sad thing.""  Trump defended his strategy in Syria, saying ""we have done a tremendous job"" battling ISIS in the war-torn nation.  Anti-aircraft system 'sold to Syria by Russians'  The target in Syria's Latakia coastal region that Israeli warplanes struck Monday was believed to be a facility that Iran was using to house sensitive military equipment that could be assembled into weapons, and then transferred to Lebanese Hezbollah, according to two US defense officials.  The officials would not detail the intelligence that led the United States to this conclusion. But they pointed out a major concern of both Israel and the United States: that Lebanese Hezbollah is gaining access to Iranian missiles that are increasingly precise and longer range in order to attack Israel.  US and Israel surveillance routinely monitors Iranian air and ground shipments into Syria. But the identification of a site focusing specifically on assembly of weapons underscores an effort by Tehran to continue to try to hide the capabilities it is trying to ship to Lebanese Hezbollah.  The officials could not say if this is the first time a facility associated with assembly of weapons has been struck by the Israelis. But one of the officials said it's the US understanding that Israel has not struck in this area for nearly five years.  Earlier Tuesday, Israel hinted at the type of target it struck. The IDF wrote on Twitter that jets ""targeted a facility of the Syrian Armed Forces from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon.""  ""These weapons were meant to attack Israel, and posed an intolerable threat against it,"" the IDF said.  The IDF alleges that by the time Syrian antiaircraft missiles had been launched, Israeli warplanes responsible for the overnight operation were already back within Israeli airspace.  The IDF also says that the Russian plane was not ""within the area of operation"" while the Israeli strike on Latakia was underway. Russia bases much of its Syrian military presence in Latakia.  A photo taken on July 23, 2006 shows a Russian IL-20M plane landing at an unknown location. Russia has blamed Israel for the loss of a military IL-20M jet Monday.  The Russian military said Israel notified the Russian side about the planned operation only a minute in advance, and that Israeli controllers would have seen the Russian plane, which was coming in to land, RIA reported.  Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Yevgenyevich Konashenkov claimed the Israelis used the plane as cover, effectively putting it in the cross hairs of the Syrian air defenses, according to RIA.  The Russian aircraft was shot down by an antiaircraft system sold by Moscow to the Syrians several years ago, a US official with knowledge of the incident told CNN Monday. The Syrian air defense network in western Syria is very densely populated with antiaircraft missile and radar systems.  In February, the two-man crew of an Israeli F-16 ejected from their aircraft when a missile exploded near them, damaging their plane as they finished conducting a mission against Syrian forces.  An Israeli defense official told CNN earlier this month that Israel has struck Syria 200 times in the past 18 months to prevent the deployment of Iranian weapons in the region.  Demilitarized zone in neighboring Idlib  The incident occurred on the same day that Russia announced a joint agreement with Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in Syria's Idlib province, which neighbors Latakia, potentially thwarting a large-scale military operation and impending humanitarian disaster in the country's last rebel stronghold.  Speaking alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at talks in Sochi on Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the creation of a 15- to 20-kilometer (approximately nine to 12 miles) demilitarized zone will prevent a ""humanitarian crisis"" in the northwestern province.  All heavy military equipment tanks, ground-to-air missiles and mortars of all the opposition groups will be removed by October 10, the leaders said. The zone, which will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian military units, will become operational from October 15.  Erdogan described the agreement as a ""solution"" to the issues in the region  Speaking Tuesday, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that the downing of the Russian aircraft would not affect the Sochi agreement ""in any way,"" adding that ""this is an important, breakthrough agreement.""  In recent weeks, Syrian and Russian planes have conducted scores of airstrikes in Idlib in the run-up to an anticipated offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces to retake the last part of the country under armed opposition.  Last week, UN officials said that more than 30,000 people fled the province in anticipation of the government offensive.",en,terrorattack,502,['Syria']

""Peace will not be achieved while the Tatmadaw remains above the law,"" Marzuki Darusman, chair of the UN fact-finding mission said in a statement Tuesday referring to the Myanmar military by its Burmese name.  ""The Tatmadaw is the greatest impediment to Myanmar's development as a modern democratic nation. The Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw, Min Aung Hlaing, and all the current leadership must be replaced, and a complete restructuring must be undertaken to place the Tatmadaw under full civilian control. Myanmar's democratic transition depends on it.""  The meticulously detailed report on the situation in Myanmar, one of the longest ever produced by a UN human rights inquiry, was described by the mission as ""unprecedented in its scope.""  ""During their operations the Tatmadaw has systematically targeted civilians, including women and children, committed sexual violence, voiced and promoted exclusionary and discriminatory rhetoric against minorities, and established a climate of impunity for its soldiers,"" Darusman said.  ""I have never been confronted by crimes as horrendous and on such a scale as these,"" he said, adding ""top generals should be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in Rakhine State.""  The report also had some criticism for the UN itself, saying the international body did not take significant action during the initial burst of violence triggering the Rohingya crisis.  It said a number of individuals within the UN system in Myanmar tried to raise human rights concerns but often felt they were ""ignored, criticised, side-lined or blocked in these efforts.""

Now what? 03:08  'Textbook example of ethnic cleansing'  While the Myanmar military -- which still retains massive amounts of power in the country despite the transition to limited democracy -- bears primary responsibility for security operations in Rakhine, the UN previously said Myanmar's civilian government had ""contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes"" through their ""acts and omissions.""  ""The State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine State,"" the report said.  Last August, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims started fleeing across the border into Bangladesh into what's since become the world's biggest refugee camp. Many of those who crossed the border have recounted horrific stories of being driven from their homes under threat of death.  Myanmar's military has repeatedly denied that it has deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya. Instead, the authorities insist that it only targets Rohingya militants, mostly from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group, which has launched deadly attacks on police posts.  ""There is no evidence that Myanmar soldiers committed any human rights violations in their response to the ARSA terrorist attacks of 2017. We have recently formed a new independent commission, which will investigate alleged rights abuses in Rakhine State including rape. We will treat any case in accordance with the rule of law,"" Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Myanmar's presidential office told CNN earlier in August.  The UN report said that ""rape and sexual violence are part of a deliberate strategy to intimidate, terrorize or punish a civilian population, and are used as a tactic of war.""  Despite being barred access to the affected regions, investigators conducted 875 interviews with victims and eyewitnesses, and examined satellite images and forensic and other documentary evidence.  In the past, the United Nations has called the alleged campaign of violence, including mass killings, rape and the burning of Rohingya villages by Myanmar government forces a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing,"" while UN Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee has said that the attacks bear the ""hallmarks of genocide.""  While Rakhine was the primary focus and has attracted widespread media coverage around the world, the UN report also highlighted ongoing conflicts between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups in Kachin and Shan state, where civilians have suffered similar abuses.  ""As in Rakhine, civilians are targeted for killings, rape, arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearance, forced labour, torture and ill-treatment, and persecution based on ethnic or religious grounds,"" said mission member Chris Sidoti.  ""To date, the long-standing conflicts in the north of Myanmar have received inadequate international attention. We hope our report will raise awareness of the critical situation in Kachin and Shan. We are seriously concerned that fighting is continuing in these regions, with new allegations of serious violations against civilians continuing to emerge.""

Despite a shift towards democracy in recent years, the military retains a bloc in parliament under the constitution and control of key ministries, as well as responsibility for security operations.  ""The Tatmadaw acts with complete impunity and has never been held accountable for the violations of international law it is consistently involved in,"" the report said.  It called on the UN Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court (ICC) or establish an ad hoc international criminal tribunal, as well as implement targeted individual sanctions, travel bans and asset freezes against senior military commanders, and an arms embargo on the country.

Uganda borders Congo's Ituri and North Kivu provinces, where Ebola is believed to have killed 97 people since the latest outbreak started in July, and infected another 45.  A death from Ebola was recorded this month in the Congolese city of Butembo , which is a hub for Congolese mineral exports and imports from East African ports via Uganda.  In a statement on Thursday, the WHO said it was assisting Uganda, which has remained clear of Ebola so far this year, to set up the ""ring vaccination"" strategy being used in Congo.  Under the strategy, every contact of an Ebola case including health workers and family members is traced and vaccinated.  ""The opportunity that vaccinating frontline health workers and ring vaccination provides to contain the disease (...) is one that must never be missed. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we are making all these costly but necessary preparations"", WHO's Uganda Representative Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam said in the statement.  Uganda has identified spaces to store the vaccine and installed equipment to ensure it can be transported nationwide.  Uganda has had five outbreaks since 2000, the latest in 2017. The contagious disease causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Ebola killed 11,300 in West Africa in 2013-2016, though treatment during that outbreak was less advanced.  The experimental vaccine, manufactured by Merck, was first deployed to the Congo this year. It is designed to target the Zaire strain of the virus, which was confirmed to have caused Congo's current outbreak.  (Reporting by Tom Miles in Geneva; Writing by Sofia Christensen)",en,diseas,,

The assault on Westgate Mall on a sunny weekend afternoon horrified the world and exposed weaknesses in Kenya's security forces after it took them hours to respond. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta promised reforms.  Now the government of East Africa's commercial hub is praising itself, saying security forces have effectively limited attacks to areas near the Somali border. ""We learnt our mistakes and corrected them,"" police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet told reporters this week, pointing out real-time intelligence sharing among security agencies.  Analysts, however, say few sustainable lessons have been learned while al-Shabab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in sub-Saharan Africa, has changed its strategy with devastating effects.  The al-Qaida-linked extremist group has vowed retribution on Kenya for sending troops to Somalia since 2011. The group has killed hundreds of people inside Kenya, which has been targeted more than any other of the six countries providing troops to an African Union force in Somalia.  ""Al-Shabab's goal in carrying out attacks outside Somalia is to pressure authorities within the region to pull their troops out of Somalia. That aim has not been achieved and all indications are that the movement continues to plot assaults in cities across East Africa to advance its objectives,"" said Murithi Mutiga, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.  A new report by the think tank says some al-Shabab extremists previously based on the Kenyan coast have moved south into Tanzania and, in response to crackdowns there, relocated into northern Mozambique and forged ties with local fighters.  The Kenyan government's initial response to the Westgate attack, involving blanket arrests of Muslims and indiscriminate crackdowns aimed at ethnic Somalis, inflamed communities and made matters worse, Mutiga said.  The government later changed its approach and appointed local ethnic Somalis to lead security operations in the northeast near the Somali border.  That area, however, has seen growing attacks by al-Shabab that have killed more than 100 police officers since May 2017.  ""Kenyan security officials seem to have failed to contain that threat,"" Mutiga said. Other major attacks since Westgate in the region, often targeting Christians, have included massacres of bus passengers and the assault on Garissa University in 2015 that left 147 people dead.  The pressure on al-Shabab since Westgate has included training and counterterrorism equipment provided by Western countries including the U.S. and Britain.  The attack also changed the way Kenyan institutions are protected. Shopping malls, office buildings, university campuses, government facilities and the main airport have invested substantial sums in additional security, including surveillance.  As al-Shabab focuses its attacks largely on Christians in Kenya's Muslim-majority border communities, it has managed to stall economic activity and education, said Kenya-based security analyst and former U.S. Marine Andrew Franklin. Many children who drop out of school as teaching staff flee become targets for recruitment by the extremists.  Kenyans make up the majority of al-Shabab's foreign fighters.  While economic activity in the borderlands weakens and corruption grows, the morale and effectiveness of security forces has eroded, Franklin said.  There is a ""tremendous amount of complacency"" among security agencies, he said, leading to the conclusion that senior officials have little interest in countering al-Shabab's insurgency.  For Andrew Munya, who was injured in the Westgate attack when shrapnel hit his left shoulder, Kenya will not be safe until al-Shabab is dealt with for good.  ""There is no difference whether a life is lost in the border areas or in the city,"" said Munya, who later became a security consultant while vowing to never to let his community and family become victims. ""All life is precious and must be protected.""  ___  Follow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa",en,terrorattack,,

Earlier reports described the assailants as ""Takfiri gunmen,"" a term previously used to describe ISIS.

The ISNA news agency published photographs of the attack's aftermath, with bloodied troops in dress uniforms helping each other walk away. The attack struck on Ahvaz's Quds, or Jerusalem, Boulevard.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility.  Ahvaz is the capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province. The province in the past has seen Arab separatists attack oil pipelines.

The attack in the southwestern city of Ahvaz came as the country marked the anniversary of the start of its 1980-1988 war with Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Iraq and prompted President Hassan Rouhani to warn of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“crushing responseÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the smallest threat will be crushingÃ¢â‚¬Â, Rouhani said on his official website. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Those who give intelligence and propaganda support to these terrorists must answer for it.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that the attack near the Iraqi border was carried out by Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorists recruited, trained, armed & paid by a foreign regimeÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Iran holds regional terror sponsors and their US masters accountable for such attacks,Ã¢â‚¬Â he wrote.  IS jihadists said via their propaganda mouthpiece Amaq that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Islamic State fighters attacked a gathering of Iranian forcesÃ¢â‚¬Â in Ahvaz.  The city lies in Khuzestan, a province bordering Iraq that has a large ethnic Arab community and has seen separatist violence in the past that Iran has blamed on its regional rivals.  State television gave a casualty toll of 29 dead and 57 wounded, while official news agency IRNA said those killed included women and children among spectators at the rally. Many of the wounded were in critical condition.  Armed forces spokesman Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi said the dead included a young girl and a former serviceman in a wheelchair.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Of the four terrorists, three were sent to hell at the scene, while the fourth who had been wounded and arrested went to hell moments ago due to his severe wounds,Ã¢â‚¬Â Shekarchi told state television.  Khuzestan deputy governor Ali-Hossein Hosseinzadeh told the semi-official ISNA news agency that Ã¢â‚¬Å“eight to nineÃ¢â‚¬Â troops were among those killed, as well as a journalist.  Finger pointed at Riyadh  Zarif did not specify which regional government he held responsible for the shooting, but IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite Revolutionary Guards said the attackers were funded by Sunni arch-rival Saudi Arabia.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Those who opened fire on civilians and the armed forces have links to the Ahvazi movement,Ã¢â‚¬Â Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif told ISNA.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are funded by Saudi Arabia and attempted to cast a shadow over the Iranian armed forces.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Zarif vowed Iran would Ã¢â‚¬Å“respond swiftly and decisively in defence of Iranian livesÃ¢â‚¬Â.  In a message of condolence to RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s close regional ally, President Vladimir Putin said he was Ã¢â‚¬Å“appalled by this bloody crimeÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This event once again reminds us about the necessity of an uncompromising battle against terrorism in all of its manifestations.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Khuzestan was a major battleground of the 1980s war with Iraq and the attack on the anniversary parade in Ahvaz had significant symbolic value.  The province saw unrest in 2005 and 2011 but has since seen been largely quiet.  Attacks by Kurdish rebels on military patrols along the border further north are relatively common.  But attacks on regime targets inside major cities are far rarer.  On June 7, 2017, 17 people were killed and dozens wounded in simultaneous attacks in Tehran on the parliament building and on the tomb of revolutionary leader Ruhollah Khomeini Ã¢â‚¬â€ the first inside Iran claimed by the Sunni Muslim extremists of the Islamic State group.  In April, 26 alleged IS jihadists went on trial on charges connected with that twin attack.  Rouhani defiant  The attack in Ahvaz came as President Rouhani was among dignitaries at the main anniversary parade in Tehran.  In a keynote speech, Rouhani vowed to boost IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ballistic missile capabilities despite Western concerns that were cited by his US counterpart Donald Trump in May when he abandoned a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will never decrease our defensive capabilitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ we will increase them day by day,Ã¢â‚¬Â Rouhani said at a military parade. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The fact that the missiles anger you shows they are our most effective weapons,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, referring to the West.  Iran has ballistic missiles with a range of up to 3,500 kilometres (2,200 miles), enough to reach both Israel and US bases in the Middle East.  The United States reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran last month, and a new round of even harsher sanctions targeting IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vital oil sector is set to go back into effect on November 5.  Washington has said it is ready to open talks on a new agreement to replace the July 2015 accord, but Tehran has said repeatedly it cannot negotiate under the pressure of the sanctions.  Trump and Rouhani will both be in New York next week for the United Nations General Assembly. But Iran has repeatedly ruled out any meeting.    ",en,terrorattack,,

(Photo by Prasit Tangprasert)  The world's first instance of rat hepatitis E virus infecting a human was discovered in a 56-year-old male resident of the city, the University of Hong Kong (HKU) revealed on Thursday night.  The case emerged when the patient -- who had undergone a liver transplant on May 14 last year at HKUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teaching hospital Queen Mary and was on immunosuppressant drugs -- showed persistently abnormal liver function tests results. This indicated problems with his liver graft.  Further tests showed he was carrying a species of hepatitis virus that until then was known to be present only in animals such as rats and was Ã¢â‚¬Å“highly divergentÃ¢â‚¬Â from the strain that affects humans.  The man lived in a housing estate Ã¢â‚¬Å“with evidence of rat infestation in the refuse bins outside his homeÃ¢â‚¬Â, HKU researchers who studied the case said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We postulate that contamination of food by infected rat droppings in the food supply is possible,Ã¢â‚¬Â they said in a report, although they noted that the route of transmission of the virus remained unclear.  The man had noticed rodent droppings but had not seen rats inside his home, according to the report. Tests on rodent droppings, swab samples from the drain and floor from the refuse room, and even rats in the area, tested negative for rat hepatitis E.  But frozen samples from a rat collected by food and environmental hygiene authorities in the district in 2012 were found to have the virus.  The patient was treated with an oral medication known as ribavirin and is recovering.  Hong Kong has experienced rodent infestations during its hot and humid summers, and hygiene authorities have for the last 18 years produced a rodent infestation index on areas they manage.  Last year, the rodent infestation rate (RIR) for June to December for the city as a whole was 3.5%, down from 4% in the same period a year earlier. But officials admitted that the RIR might not fully reflect the situation in individual districts.  Before this case, there had been no previous evidence that rat hepatitis E, one of the variants of the virus that affects mammals, could be transmitted to humans.  Every year, the hepatitis E virus infects about 20 million people worldwide. It is known to be transmitted via food or water contaminated by faeces containing the pathogens. Patients have also got the virus from eating undercooked meat from infected animals and through blood transfusions from infected donors.  Symptoms of hepatitis E viral infection include fever, reduced appetite, abdominal pain and jaundice. In rare cases, it could lead to acute liver failure and death.  Details of the study, led by Professor Yuen Kwok-yung and Dr Siddharth Sridhar from the universityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s department of microbiology, will be published in the medical journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in December.  HKU will hold a press briefing on Friday afternoon to reveal more about the case.  Earlier this summer, Hong Kong faced a rampant rodent problem, with control officers reporting double-digit growth in demand for their services over the past few months. Facebook posts from users in Tseung Kwan O, Ma On Shan and Ho Man Tin showed images of rats or mice caught on glue boards or scouting around packaged food in supermarket fridges.",en,diseas,,

The French government announced on Tuesday that it was freezing assets belonging to two suspected Iranian intelligence operatives, as well as others belonging to Iran's ministry of intelligence and security.  France's decision to take retaliatory measures and go public with the accusations was taken three months after the alleged plot to bomb a meeting of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran (MEK) in a suburb of Paris.  ""This extremely serious act envisaged on our territory could not go without a response,"" France's interior, foreign and economy ministers said in a rare joint statement. ""In taking this decision, France underlines its determination to fight against terrorism in all its forms, particularly on its own territory.""  A French diplomatic source told AFP that the security forces had concluded that ""the head of operations at the (Iranian) intelligence ministry ordered it"". Iran immediately denied any involvement, as it did in July when the MEK accused it of being responsible.  Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi told AFP in an interview that Teheran rejected the French complaint ""completely and forcefully"", but said the door for discussion was open.  ""If there is a misunderstanding... about a thing that does not exist, be it a conspiracy by others or a mistake, we can sit down and talk about it,"" he said on Tuesday.  The US, which has been intensifying pressure on Iran, warned that ""this outrageous behaviour will not be tolerated"" in a tweet from the White House's National Security Council.  The alleged bomb plot came to light two days after thousands of Iranian opposition supporters gathered at an exhibition centre outside Paris on June 30. The meeting was attended by two allies of US President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.  The MEK was formed in the 1960s to overthrow the Shah of Iran and it continues to organise opposition to the current leaders of the Islamic Republic who took power following the 1979 revolution.  Belgium announced in July that it had arrested a couple in a Brussels suburb who were suspected of preparing to drive a car packed with explosives to the French rally.  A total of six people were then detained in coordinated raids by European police, including an Iranian diplomat based in Vienna.  The diplomat, Mr Assadollah Asadi, was targeted by the asset freezes announced by the French authorities on Tuesday, along with Mr Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, who the French diplomatic source said was head of operations at the intelligence ministry.  The measures announced on Tuesday come as French President Emmanuel Macron and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani are at odds over a host of issues.  Mr Macron, who hoped to improve ties with Teheran at the start of his presidency last year, has allied with Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal which limits the Islamic Republic's atomic programme.  While Mr Trump has pulled the US out of the agreement and denounced it, Mr Macron has been a vocal supporter and has worked to keep the accord alive despite American sanctions.  But Mr Macron is at loggerheads with Mr Rouhani over the wars in Syria and Yemen, in which Iran is a major player, and has also raised concerns about the country's ballistic missile programme.

2118255,aljazeera,Bill Law Is A Middle East Analyst About The Author Bill Law,I know Jamal Khashoggi personally and I fear for his safety,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/fear-jamal-khashoggi-181004080147143.html,,5/10/2018 1:27,"Reports have emerged that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has gone missing after entering the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul on October 2. For those of us who know Khashoggi personally, this is very worrying, especially in the context of the ongoing crackdown on dissent led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he is known.  I have known Jamal Khashoggi for the better part of 16 years. I met him in Jeddah in 2002 on my first visit to the kingdom. At the time he was the deputy editor-in-chief of Arab News, the main English-language newspaper in Saudi Arabia.  He was also someone who in his youth had known Osama bin Laden and had subsequently interviewed him several times between 1987 and 1995. Although he already had a reputation as a forthright journalist in a country where the media was very much the handmaid of the regime, my interest at the time was to hear from someone who actually knew bin Laden.  I remember him saying, with a twinkle in his eye (and anyone who knows him will recognise the twinkle) that the thing about Osama was that he had ""gotten in with the wrong crowd"".  In 2003, Jamal went on to briefly edit leading Saudi newspaper Al Watan, lasting on the job barely two months before being sacked for publishing articles critical of the conservative religious elite. His subsequent career followed the same trajectory. He is a brilliant journalist with a fiercely independent mind but with sufficient pragmatism to know just how close to the red lines he could go.  He returned to Al Watan in 2007 and managed to remain editor for three years. His strategy was to survive in the post until an article that was just a tad too critical got him into trouble. Then he would lay low before re-emerging. That takes a great deal of courage, especially in a country like Saudi Arabia.  In 2010, Saudi business magnate Prince al-Waleed bin Talal (one of the businessmen MBS imprisoned in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in his infamous shakedown) asked Khashoggi to head his new media project, al-Arab News Channel.  It was envisioned as an independent, privately-funded Arabic news broadcaster, which was supposed to offer objective, agenda-free coverage of current events in the region. Five years later it was finally launched in Bahrain's capital Manama but was almost immediately shut down after airing an interview with a Bahraini opposition leader.  One of the ironies of the Mohammed bin Salman regime - and for those affected it is a cruel one - is that individuals who were supportive of Vision 2030, his programme of economic and social reform, very quickly fell under the suspicious gaze of this impetuous young man.  One of them was Khashoggi. Fearing arrest at any moment, he left Saudi Arabia in September 2017. At the time he lamented his forced departure and that of other friends and colleagues who fled ahead of being seized. In effective exile, he penned opinion pieces for the Washington Post and in his first column, he had this to say:  ""My friends and I living abroad feel helpless. We want our country to thrive and to see the 2030 Vision realized. We are not opposed to our government and care deeply about Saudi Arabia. It is the only home we know or want. Yet we are the enemy.""  His most recent column was this past September 11 and in a characteristically balanced article he called on MBS to work toward bringing an end to the war in Yemen: ""The longer this cruel war lasts, the more permanent the damage will beÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. The crown prince must bring an end to the violence and restore the dignity of the birthplace of Islam.""  The message that MBS strives to impart, in the West at least, is that the kingdom is open for business, it has returned to a moderate Islam, it has allowed movie theatres, it displays progressive thinking by, for example, granting women the right to drive - yet it has arrested the women activists who campaigned for that right.  The disconnect between many of the good economic reforms MBS wants to secure and the way he is ruthlessly using his power to crush any dissent grows ever wider by the day. And it begs the question: What is he afraid of?  Was he worried that women campaigners would undermine his authority by seeking more rights? Did he think that moderate cleric Salman al-Awdah, who was jailed last year and is currently facing the possibility of a death sentence, would seek to turn his 14 million Twitter followers against him? Did he fear that a brave journalist writing for an influential Washington publication would weaken his standing in DC?  All these people have supported MBS's Vision 2030. They could have been his allies, as he launched this bold and necessary project to transform the country. Instead, as Khashoggi wrote, he treated them as if they were the enemy.  These are the anxieties not of a powerful leader but of a man who is, in point of fact, displaying grave weakness.  I fear for Jamal Khashoggi who went to the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in good faith.  He is a good man and a fine journalist. His is a voice of reasoned criticism and wise comment that the Saudi crown prince should listen to.  The thought that he might be forcibly repatriated back to the kingdom to face charges that could lead to a long prison sentence, or worse, fills me with dread.  I hope that good sense and common decency will prevail and he will be let go.

2134362,jakartaglobe,None,Egyptian Military Finds Debris of Crashed Airliner,https://jakartaglobe.id/news-international/egyptian-military-finds-debris-crashed-airliner/,20/5/2016 17:13,7/10/2018 19:30,"Although fingers pointed towards Islamist militants who blew up another airliner over Egypt just seven months ago, no group had claimed responsibility more than 24 hours after the disappearance of flight MS804, an Airbus A320 that was flying from Paris to Cairo.  Three French investigators and a technical expert from Airbus arrived in Cairo early on Friday to help investigate the fate of the missing plane, airport sources said.  Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said on Thursday that it was too early to rule out any explanation for the disaster. The country's aviation minister said a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure.  Friday's announcement that debris had been found followed earlier confusion about whether wreckage had been located. Greek searchers found some material on Thursday, but the airline later said this was not from its plane.  While there was no official explanation of the cause of the crash, suspicion immediately fell on Islamist militants who have been fighting against Egypt's government since Sisi toppled an elected Islamist leader in 2013. In October, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian jetliner that exploded after taking off from an Egyptian tourist resort. Russian investigators blamed a bomb smuggled on board.  Last year's crash already devastated Egypt's tourist industry, one of the main sources of foreign exchange for a country of 80 million people, and another similar attack would crush hopes of it recovering.  While most governments were cautious about jumping to conclusions, U.S. Republican candidate for president Donald Trump tweeted swiftly after the plane's disappearance: ""Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?""  Many hours later his likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton also said it appeared to be an act of terrorism, although she said an investigation would have to determine the details.  Officials from a number of US agencies told Reuters that a US review of satellite imagery so far had not produced any signs of an explosion. They said the United States had not ruled out any possible causes for the crash, including mechanical failure, terrorism or a deliberate act by the pilot or crew.  Amid uncertainty about what brought down the plane, Los Angeles International Airport became the first major US air transportation hub to say it was stepping up security measures.  'Lives are so cheap'  The plane vanished just as it was exiting air space controlled by Greece for air space controlled by Egypt. Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos said the Airbus swerved radically and plunged from 11,277 meters (37,000 feet) to 4572 meters (15,000 feet) before vanishing from Greek radar screens.  According to Greece's civil aviation chief, calls from Greek air traffic controllers to MS804 went unanswered just before it left Greek airspace, and it disappeared from radar screens soon afterwards.  There was no official indication of a possible cause, whether technical failure, human error or sabotage.  Ultra-hardline Islamists have targeted airports, airliners and tourist sites in Europe, Egypt, Tunisia and other Middle Eastern countries over the past few years.  The aircraft was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two infants, and 10 crew, EgyptAir said. They included 30 Egyptian and 15 French nationals, along with citizens of 10 other countries. A320s normally seat 150 people. The plane had made scheduled flights to Tunisia and Eritrea on Wednesday before arriving in Paris from Cairo.  At Cairo airport, a man sat on a brown leather couch crying with his hands covering his face on Thursday. ""How long will Egypt live if human lives are so cheap?"" he said.  The mother of a flight attendant rushed in tears out of the VIP hall where families waited. She said the last time her daughter called her was Wednesday night. ""They haven't told us anything,"" she said.  Reuters",en,terrorattack,,

Hisham al-Ashmawy, a former army officer, is accused of being behind several deadly attacks in Egypt and an attempt against a top state official.  He had a suicide vest strapped on, said the Libyan National Army, which controls much of eastern Libya.  Libya has been unstable since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.  His 40-year rule ended when he was ousted and killed by rebels during the so-called Arab Spring protests.  The North African country is now mostly controlled by a UN-backed government based in the capital, Tripoli, and by the rival LNA, under military strongman Khalifa Haftar, whose forces hold sway in much of the eastern part of the country.  The LNA said in June that it had taken control of Darnah from jihadists though it was still facing some sporadic resistance.  ""The terrorist Ashmawy was arrested in the Al-Maghar neighbourhood in the city of Darnah and was wearing an explosive vest but was unable to detonate it,"" the LNA said about the capture.  It said it would hand over the militant to Egyptian authorities after investigations, Reuters news agency reports.  Egypt has close relations with the LNA and has launched air strikes over Darnah, saying it was targeting jihadists linked to militant activity inside Egypt.  Egyptian officials say Ashmawy was behind the attempted assassination of then Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim in May 2013, and the killing of the country's top public prosecutor in a car bomb in 2015.  They say he headed the al-Qaeda-linked Ansar al-Islam militant group, after switching his allegiance away from the Islamic State group.  Ansar al-Islam claimed responsibility for an ambush that killed dozens of Egyptian policemen last year.",un,terrorattack,,

The identity of those detained in TuesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operation was not immediately clear.

Air strikes killed or wounded 649 Afghans, more than any full-year period since the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) began keeping records in 2009, as US and Afghan forces stepped up aerial bombardments.  Advertisement  That figure accounted for eight percent of overall civilian casualties for the January to September period, which slipped to 8,050 - 2,798 dead and 5,252 injured - UNAMA said.  ""Every civilian death leaves a family devastated, grieving and struggling to come to terms with the loss, and each civilian injured or maimed causes untold suffering,"" said Danielle Bell, UNAMA's human rights chief.  International forces accounted for 51 per cent of the civilian casualties caused by air strikes, the report said. Afghan forces made up 38 per cent.  The United States is the only foreign force known to carry out air strikes in Afghanistan.  Advertisement  Advertisement  US and Afghan forces have dramatically increased air offensives against Taliban and Islamic State insurgents in the past year as they try to get the upper hand in the 17-year war.  US forces employed 746 weapons in July, which was the highest monthly total since November 2010, the most recent US Air Forces Central Command data shows.  That is more than double the 350 munitions used in July 2017, a month before US President Donald Trump announced his new strategy for Afghanistan that gave American forces greater leeway to go after militants.  Afghanistan's fledgling air force has also accelerated bombardments as the United States beefs up the country's aerial capability with more aircraft and better weapons.  The latest civilian casualties report follows two air strikes in recent weeks that UNAMA's initial findings show killed more than 20 people from two families.  Improvised explosive devices, including suicide bombs, remained the leading cause of civilian casualties in the first nine months, rising 21 per cent to 3,634, the report said.  UNAMA warned earlier that the increasing number of ""deliberate and indiscriminate attacks"" against civilians constituted ""serious violations of international humanitarian law"" that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.  The majority of civilian casualties were attributed to militants. The Taliban, Afghanistan's largest militant group, were responsible for 35 per cent and the Islamic State group 25 percent, UNAMA said.  While the IS has fewer fighters than the Taliban, it has carried out most of the devastating suicide attacks in urban areas in recent months.  The eastern province of Nangarhar recorded 1,494 casualties, more than double the same period last year and the highest number for any province.  A record number of civilians were killed in the first half of 2018, underscoring the growing violence that has been a trend since NATO combat forces withdrew from the country in 2014.

KINSHASA: Congolese authorities announced a ban on Wednesday on harboring suspected Ebola patients and promised police protection for health workers at burials, in a bid to fight back against local resistance to efforts to combat the disease.  Residents of eastern Congo have attacked health workers and refused to cooperate with government efforts to combat Ebola there, the country's second major outbreak of the disease this year, which is believed to have killed 118 people since July.  Advertisement  Ebola has spread to Beni, a city of several hundred thousand people where scores of people have been confirmed infected. The authorities worry that without the cooperation of the local population they will have difficulty containing it.  The Health Ministry has been reporting 1-2 new confirmed cases a day in recent weeks, but reported seven late on Tuesday - six in Beni and one in the town of Masereka, 100 km away. It blamed the faster pace on community resistance to measures to fight the outbreak.  Local mistrust and attacks by rebel groups have disrupted treatment and vaccination programs. Beni's mayor Jean Edmond Nyonyi Bwanakawa told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday the decree banning the harboring of patients would be signed into law later in the day.  The Health Ministry said the decree would impose a jail term of up to three months on those who harbor suspected Ebola patients.

Families will need a death certificate in order to obtain a burial permit, and health workers will be allowed police protection during burials.  Proper burial of Ebola victims is critical to control the disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.  Three volunteers for the Congolese Red Cross were attacked by villagers last week as they were helping with the burial of an Ebola victim, prompting the suspension of some burials in the area.

The censure by the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child coincided with international concern at the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Riyadh's military role in Yemen, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct 2.  Pressure has mounted on Saudi Arabia, including from allies, to do more to limit civilian casualties in a 3-1/2 year civil war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.  Riyadh leads a Western-backed coalition of Arab states supporting the Yemeni government in fighting against the Iran-allied Houthi movement that controls Yemen's capital.  Saudi Arabia told the child rights panel last week that it was working hard to correct mistaken targeting by its military alliance, but the experts voiced scepticism.  The panel of 18 independent experts, in its conclusions issued on Thursday, took note of the Saudi statement but said that Yemeni children continue to be killed, maimed and orphaned.  At least 1,248 children had been killed and nearly the same number injured in air strikes since March 2015, including dozens killed in a strike on a school bus in Saada province in August, it said.  All sides have carried out attacks on civilian targets in Yemen including homes, medical facilities, schools, farms, weddings and markets, in breach of international law, it said.  The panel voiced concern at ""the inefficiency of the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) set up by the coalition in 2016 to investigate allegations of unlawful attacks by (Saudi Arabia) and members of the coalition on children and facilities and spaces frequented by children"".  ""There has been no case, let alone a case involving child casualties, recruitment or use of children in armed hostilities, where its investigations led to prosecutions and/or disciplinary sanctions imposed upon individuals, including military officials of (Saudi Arabia),"" it said.  The panel called for lifting the coalition's aerial and naval blockade which it said has deprived millions of Yemenis of food and other vital supplies, mainly through Hodeidah port.  In March, another U.N. rights panel called on Saudi Arabia to end discriminatory practices against women, including its pervasive system of male guardianship.

In October last year, a Kurdish-Arab alliance pushed the Islamic State group (ISIS) out of the northern city, backed by air strikes of the US-led coalition.  During the campaign to expel jihadists from the city, hundreds of civilians were killed in the battle, most of them in coalition bombardments, Amnesty says.  ""The US-led coalition's ongoing failure to admit to, let alone adequately investigate, the shocking scale of civilian deaths and destruction it caused in Raqa is a slap in the face for survivors,"" the London-based group said in a statement.  One year on, Amnesty says that the coalition had admitted to having caused just 100 civilians deaths in the Raqa assault, but even in those cases accepted no liability.  ""It is completely reprehensible that the coalition refuses to acknowledge its role in most of the civilian casualties it caused,"" Amnesty's new secretary-general Kumi Naidoo said.  And it is ""abhorrent that even where it has admitted responsibility, it accepts no obligation towards its victims,"" he said.  ""It is completely reprehensible that the coalition refuses to acknowledge its role in most of the civilian casualties it caused,"" Amnesty's new secretary-general Kumi Naidoo said.  And it is ""abhorrent that even where it has admitted responsibility, it accepts no obligation towards its victims,"" he said.  Denouncing a ""disturbing pattern"" of civilian deaths, the rights groups urged the coalition to conduct a probe, both to establish the facts behind each deadly strike, and to avoid any future mistakes.  ""Surely, with hundreds of civilians dead, it begs the question what went wrong,"" Naidoo said, urging the coalition to look into issues such as weapons used and quality of intelligence.  ""These are crucial details, to establish both facts and assess lawfulness, as well as learn the lessons necessary to avoid similar mistakes,"" he said.  The latter was ""fundamental to minimising harm to civilians -- a legal obligation"", he said.  ISIS overran large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014, declaring a so-called ""caliphate"" there, and the coalition intervened the same year to fight the extremist group.  The jihadists have since seen their proto-state crumble, but cling on to a presence in the Syrian desert and in an eastern pocket on the Iraqi border where they are under attack by coalition-backed forces.  Since 2014 the US-led coalition has acknowledged direct responsibility for more than 1,100 civilian deaths in Syria and Iraq, but rights groups put the number killed much higher.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, says coalition strikes in Syria alone have killed more than 3,300 civilians.  Syria's war has killed more than 360,000 people since it erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,,

Police said they found a passport issued to a 55-year-old Syrian man at the scene, and that the suspect had claimed to be a member of the Islamic State militant group.  ""The investigation is considering all possibilities and we are not ruling out terrorism,"" Cologne deputy police chief Miriam Brauns told a news conference.  Heavily armed police commandos using stun grenades had shot the man when they stormed the scene, freeing the female hostage who suffered minor injuries. Two other people were injured and the attacker was badly wounded with multiple shots.  Authorities had received an alert at 12:42 local time (1042 GMT) at Cologne railway station, one of the busiest in Europe. They evacuated the scene and halted all trains at the station next to Cologne's iconic twin-spired cathedral.  The man sparked panic when he entered a McDonald's restaurant inside the station and hurled a molotov cocktail, leaving a 14-year-old girl with burns.  An eyewitness told journalists how she heard screams and saw ""a girl running for her life"" with flames spreading up her leg, before she was helped by bystanders.  - Syrian passport found -  As the sprinkler system activated and water rained down in the fast-food restaurant, the man entered an adjacent pharmacy and took another woman hostage, whom he also threatened to burn in the ensuing drama, said police.  Police negotiated with him in a bid to defuse the tense situation and ascertain his motive, then stormed the pharmacy around 3:00 pm (1300 GMT).  The man was holding a pistol -- said to be either a replica or real, when commandos stormed the site, and he was also in possession of a flammable liquid and camping gas containers, two of them taped together.  ""Special response units overpowered the man. During the police action he hurt two bystanders, one of them seriously,"" police said in a statement.  Police said they could not yet positively identify the hostage taker, who was undergoing surgery, but believed he was a 55-year-old Syrian migrant.  Syrian identity documents had been found in the pharmacy for a man who had been issued a residency permit in Germany valid until 2021.  The man identified in the document was known to police for previous offences including theft and illegal drugs possession.  Klaus-Stephan Becker, head of Cologne criminal police, also told news channel NTV that ""it could be a foiled terrorist attack"".  The man had carried a suitcase and bag, which he left in the restaurant, and had also demanded ""the release of a Tunisian woman"", said police commander Klaus Rueschenschmidt, without giving further details.  Police set up a webpage where members of the public could upload pictures and video related to the incident, while their own investigations were ""at full pitch"".  Germany remains on high alert over the risk of a jihadist attack, having suffered several in recent years.  The bloodiest claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group was a truck rampage through a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016 that left 12 people dead.  In June 2018, German police said they foiled what would have been the first biological attack with the arrest of a Tunisian suspected jihadist in possession of the deadly poison ricin and bomb-making material.  Germany remains a target for jihadist groups, in particular because of its involvement in the coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, and its deployment in Afghanistan since 2001.",en,terrorattack,,

Officials said the planes, both single-seat F-7 fighters, apparently struck a broadcast tower. One plummeted into a rice paddy, while the other nose-dived near a famous Buddhist pagoda in the Magway region of central Myanmar. Both jets broke into pieces upon hitting the ground at around 7.30am, said Aung Moe Nyo, the chief minister of Magway.  An 11-year-old girl, Thwal Zin Nyein, was killed when debris from one of the jets struck her as she was studying outside at a private school. The chunk of the aircraft, which had instructions for the installation of a bomb affixed to it, scattered notebooks, rulers and pencil cases decorated with cartoons.  ""The doctor said she passed away but I still can't believe my daughter died like this,"" said Khin Maung Phyu, her father. ""She will always be alive in my heart.""  The bodies of the two pilots, Captain Phyo Maung Maung and Captain Hein Thu Aung, were in the wreckage, Aung Moe Nyo said.  ""It was heartbreaking to see,"" said Aung Moe Nyo, who visited the scene of the crashes and said one of the pilots had tried to eject by parachute.  Myanmar's air force has suffered a string of fatal accidents over the past couple of years, even as the top brass have gone on an overseas spending spree. Around 13 per cent of the nation's Budget is spent on its military.  In April, another F-7 crashed during training because of what was described as a ""technical failure"". Last year, 122 military personnel and their relatives, along with aircraft crew members, were killed when a Chinese-made Y-8 military transport aircraft flew into a storm cloud and plunged into the Andaman Sea.  ""We can see from the frequency of the plane crashes that we have some problems with Chinese planes,"" said Ye Myo Hein, the executive director of the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies in Yangon.  ""A lot of the Chinese jet fighters in Myanmar are not actively flying because some are out of date and some need major overhaul,"" he added.  On Tuesday morning, four planes took off in bad weather from a military base in Magway but only two returned to base, said a statement posted on the website of the office of Myanmar's commander-in-chief.  Aung Moe Nyo, the Magway chief minister, said that the planes had collided with a broadcast transmission tower that was obscured by the poor weather.  Myanmar purchased around 60 F-7 fighter jets from China in the early 1990s. The F-7 is considered a clone of the Soviet-era MiG-21 and was built for export to countries including Pakistan, Iran, Sudan and North Korea, among others.  In August, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar's commander in chief, attended a military fair in Moscow and signed contracts for new weaponry and military hardware.  ""Since the early 2000s, the Myanmar military was not happy with China so it tried to diversify and buy from Russia,"" Ye Myo Hein said.  The Tatmadaw, as Myanmar's military is called, ruled the country for nearly half a century before ceding some power to a civilian government. But its stark record of human-rights abuses endures. United Nations experts say the military's brutal campaign last year to evict around 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine state, in Myanmar's far west, should result in top generals being tried for genocide.  Persecution of other ethnic minorities in Myanmar, like the Kachin and the Shan, continues, rights groups say.  Over the weekend, hundreds of people, including Buddhist monks, marched in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar, in support of the military. The protest was designed to condemn foreign nations and international groups that were pressuring the military and ""interfering in internal affairs"", according to the event's organisers.  Apart from international organisations that have urged legal action against Myanmar's top generals for the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, Western nations have also begun imposing targeted sanctions on individual officers and severing military links with the Tatmadaw.",en,terrorattack,,

The air strike, which was launched on Friday, occurred near the al-Shabab-controlled community of Harardere in Mudug province in the central part of the country, the US Africa Command announced on Tuesday.  According to its assessment no civilians were killed or wounded, the statement said.  It was the largest US air strike since a November 2017 attack, which killed about 100 al-Shabab fighters.  The US military has carried out more than two dozen air strikes, including drone strikes, this year against the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab.  Somalia on Sunday marked the first anniversary of al-Shabab's deadliest attack, a truck bombing in Mogadishu that killed well over 500 people.  A US Africa Command spokesperson said the air strike had no link to the anniversary.  The United States has increased its military presence in Somalia since early 2017 to about 500 personnel after President Donald Trump approved expanded military operations.  Al-Shabab continues to hold parts of the country's south and central regions after being chased out of Mogadishu several years ago.  The group, estimated at several thousands of fighters, still carries out deadly attacks against high-profile targets such as hotels and checkpoints in the capital and other cities.  It also remains a threat in parts of neighboring Kenya.",en,terrorattack,525,"['Somalia', 'US']"

Eighteen-year-old Vladislav Roslyakov turned up at the college in the city of Kerch on Wednesday afternoon carrying a firearm and then began shooting, investigators said. His body was later found in the college with what they said were self-inflicted gunshot wounds.  There were no immediate clues as to his motive in mounting such an attack, which recalled similar shooting sprees carried out by students in U.S. schools.  Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 , prompting international condemnation and Western sanctions, but since then there have been no major outbreaks of violence on the peninsula.  Many of the victims from WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attacks were teenage students who suffered shrapnel and bullet wounds.  Pupils and staff described scenes of mayhem as panicked pupils tried to flee the building. They said the attack had started with an explosion, followed by more blasts, and a hail of gunfire.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting in the southern Russian resort of Sochi with his Egyptian counterpart, declared a momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s silence for the victims. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is a clearly a crime,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The motives will be carefully investigated.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“CHILDRENÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S BODIES EVERYWHEREÃ¢â‚¬Â  The director of the school, Olga Grebennikova, described the scene that she encountered when she entered the college building after the attack.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are bodies everywhere, childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bodies everywhere. It was a real act of terrorism. They burst in five or 10 minutes after IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d left. They blew up everything in the hall, glass was flying,Ã¢â‚¬Â Grebennikova told Crimean media outlets.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They then ran about throwing some kind of explosives around, and then ran around the second floor with guns, opened the office doors, and killed anyone they could find.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Flowers are seen placed at a memorial by the Kremlin walls to commemorate the victims of a fatal attack on a college in the Crimean port city of Kerch, in Moscow, Russia October 17, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin  Soon after the attack, Russian officials said they were investigating the possibility that it was terrorism. Troops with armoured personnel carriers were sent to the scene. Local parents were told to collect their children from the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schools and kindergartens for their safety.  However, the Investigative Committee, the state body that investigates major crimes, said later that it was re-classifying the case from terrorism to mass murder.  An employee at KerchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hospital said dozens of people were being treated for their injuries in the emergency room and in the operating theatre.  Anastasia Yenshina, a 15-year-old student at the college, said she was in a toilet on the ground floor of the building with some friends when she heard the sound of an explosion.  Officials said an explosive device had gone off in the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cafeteria during the attack and that a second device had been found among RoslyakovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belongings and defused.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I came out and there was dust and smoke, I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been deafened,Ã¢â‚¬Â Yenshina told Reuters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyone started running. I did not know what to do. Then they told us to leave the building through the gymnasium.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyone ran there... I saw a girl lying there. There was a child who was being helped to walk because he could not move on his own. The wall was covered in blood. Then everyone started to climb over the fence, and we could still hear explosions. Everyone was scared. People were crying.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Photographs from the scene of the blast showed that the ground floor windows of the two-storey building had been blown out, and that debris was lying on the floor outside.  Emergency services teams could be seen in the photographs carrying wounded people from the building on makeshift stretchers and loading them on to buses and ambulances.  A second pupil at the college, who gave his name as Sergei, said he had taken a few steps out of the building into the street when the first blast went off. He was hit by debris from the blast and injured in the leg.  Sergei, 15, told Reuters he ran to another building, but said he could hear more explosions going off every few seconds. He took cover and after the attack was over, he was taken to hospital in an ambulance.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I arrived at the hospital, the scene there was awful. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re bringing in people all covered in blood, some with arms missing, some with legs missing.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Slideshow (21 Images)  Reporting by Moscow newsroom; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Gareth Jones",en,terrorattack,529,['Crimea']

Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistan's most powerful security officials, was killed on Thursday when a bodyguard opened fire following a meeting in the governor's compound in the southern province of Kandahar, officials said.  KANDAHAR, Afghanistan: Gen. Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistan's most powerful security officials, was killed on Thursday when a bodyguard opened fire following a meeting in the governor's compound in the southern province of Kandahar, officials said.  Gen. Scott Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan who had been at the meeting with Razeq only moments earlier, was not injured in the attack. But the local commander of the NDS intelligence service and the Kandahar provincial governor Zalmay Wesa were also killed.  Advertisement  The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they had targeted both Miller and Razeq, the police chief of Kandahar who had a fearsome reputation as a ruthless opponent of the insurgents in their southern Afghan heartlands.  The attack was a devastating blow to the Afghan government ahead of parliamentary elections on Saturday, which the Taliban have vowed to disrupt.  The attack underlined how precarious the situation remains in Afghanistan even after Taliban and U.S. officials had opened preliminary contacts aimed at establishing the basis for future peace talks.  Officials said Razeq, Miller and the other officials were walking towards a landing zone as the helicopter taking the U.S. general's party back to Kabul approached to land when the gunman, who was waiting outside, opened fire on the group.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""Provincial officials including the governor, the police chief and other officials were accompanying the foreign guests to the aircraft when the gunshots happened,"" said Said Jan Khakrezwal, the head of the provincial council.  BODY ARMOUR  At least two hand grenade explosions and sporadic gunfire from around the compound were also reported by officials.  The three Afghan officials were all severely wounded when the gunman opened fire and two members of Miller's protection detail were also hit in the crossfire but Miller, who took command of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the NATO-led Resolute Support mission last month was not injured.  Local officials said Miller appeared to have been saved by his body armour but there was no immediate confirmation from NATO headquarters.  ""The brutal police chief of Kandahar has been killed along several other officials,"" a Taliban statement said.  Razeq was criticised by human rights groups but highly respected by U.S. officers who saw him as one of Afghanistan's most effective leaders, largely responsible for keeping Kandahar province under control.  The flamboyant commander, whose men wore badges bearing his name, had survived several attempts on his life over many years and narrowly escaped an attack last year in which five diplomats from the United Arab Emirates were killed in Kandahar.  A cameramen working for Afghanistan's RTA state television was also killed on Thursday, the director of the Afghanistan journalists center, Ahmad Quraishi, said.

The former lawyer from Ilford, east London, abided by the law for many years before becoming a hate preacher and Islamic extremist accused of encouraging terrorism.  Here is a timeline of the key events leading up to his imprisonment and subsequent release.  Born in the UK  Choudary, who is of Pakistani descent, was born in the UK. He is the son of a market trader.  He enrolled as a medical student at the University of Southampton but failed his first-year exams because of his party lifestyle.  He switched to law in his final year and found work at a legal firm, later becoming the chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers.  Image: Choudary speaking to a group of demonstrators  Forms al Muhajiroun  Choudary began showing an interest in religion, becoming a regular at mosques.  He met Syrian-born Islamist, Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, at a mosque in Woolwich.  Mohammed had initially launched al Muhajiroun in Saudi Arabia in 1983. He came to the UK three years later when he was expelled from the kingdom.  Together, Choudary and Mohammed formed al Muhajiroun in the UK in 1996. The terrorist Salafi jihadist organisation would later become linked to international terrorism, homophobia and antisemitism.  The group campaigned to unite Muslims across the world and demanded the global imposition of Sharia law.  Although al Muhajiroun publicly disbanded in 2004, it reformed and operated under different aliases. It was proscribed under the UK Terrorism Act, together with other organisations including Islam4UK.  Image: Choudary (C) addresses Muslim protesters outside the Old Bailey Courts in 2006  Marriage  Choudary married Rubana Akhtar, a member of al Muhajiroun - who later became the group's head of women.  The couple have four children.  Image: The Islamist preacher faces a series of restrictions now he has been released  Jihadist military training  The Sunday Telegraph reported that Muslims were receiving weapons training at secret locations in Britain. Most of the trainees would go on to fight for Osama bin Laden's International Islamic Front.  Choudary was identified as a key figure in recruiting for the training centres in the report.  9/11 notoriety  Al Muhajiroun hit the headlines for a conference which described the hijackers behind the September 11 attacks of 2001 as the ""Magnificent 19"".  Image: Choudary speaking to a group of demonstrators  Speaks against Christian faith  Choudary spoke against Christianity, posting a sermon on an Islamic website.  He said: ""Every Muslim has a responsibility to protect his family from the misguidance of Christmas, because its observance will lead to hellfire.  ""Protect your Paradise from being taken away - protect yourself and your family from Christmas.""  London Stock Exchange plot  Police uncovered a plot by an al Qaeda gang to detonate a bomb at the London Stock Exchange.  The men had planned to send five mail bombs to various London locations including the stock exchange and the home of the then London mayor, Boris Johnson.  Six of the nine terrorists convicted said they had been personally taught by Choudary, who later said their plans had been ""taken out of context"".  Image: Choudary posing in front of the Houses of Parliament  Poppy burners  On Remembrance Day 2010, members of al Muhajiroun gathered near the Royal Albert Hall to burn poppies.  Throughout the two-minute silence they could be heard shouting ""British soldiers burn in hell"".  The following March, Emdadur Choudhury, who was 26 at the time, was convicted of a public order offence.  Anjem Choudary reportedly paid his friend's Ã‚Â£50 fine.  Drummer Lee Rigby murder  British sergeant Lee Rigby was murdered close to his barracks in Woolwich by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who were both connected to al Muhajiroun.  Image: Michael Adebolajo (L) and Michael Adebowale were convicted of killing Lee Rigby  Drummer Rigby, 25, was off duty at the time but wearing a Help for Heroes sweatshirt. He was run over by their car and then partly decapitated in the street.  Image: Lee Rigby  Adebolajo was filmed standing near Choudary at protest in London.  Choudary was later filmed saying the pair would go to paradise for the killing.  In response to Choudary's comments, then prime minister David Cameron said: ""Let's be clear about Anjem Choudary: he does have absolutely despicable and appalling views, an absolutely classic case of that poisonous narrative of extremism and violence that we need to confront and defeat.""  Siddhartha Dhar  Siddhartha Dhar, a former bouncy castle salesman, narrated a chilling Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) video in which a number of suspected spies were executed.  The 32-year-old was a spokesman for al Muhajiroun and a close associate of Choudary.  Convicted of supporting IS  Choudary was found guilty of inviting support for IS. He was convicted alongside Mohammed Rahman, 33, in connection with speeches posted on YouTube.  In September 2016, he was jailed for five years and six months.  At the time he was jailed, Choudary had been linked to 15 terror plots dating back approximately 20 years.  He also had connections to hundreds of British jihadists who fled to Syria to fight.  David Videcette, a former detective who investigated the 7 July 2005 London attacks, said: ""Every plot I ever researched - someone in it was linked to Choudary.""  Image: Choudary with Mohammed Rahman in 2016  Release from prison  Choudary was released from Belmarsh prison on 19 October after serving half of his sentence.  For the rest of the sentence period, he will be subject to a strict supervision regime, with about 25 licence conditions.",en,terrorattack,,

ISIS is also known as Islamic State (IS).  The report, issued last Thursday (Oct 18), said the terror group would continue to launch attacks even though law enforcers have been searching for its members across the country following deadly suicide bombings in Surabaya, East Java, in May.  ""The defeats of the IS in the Middle East have not weakened the determination of IS supporters to wage war at home since they can no longer get to Syria,"" Ipac director Sidney Jones said.  Future attacks, the Ipac said, might occur after ""a period of dormancy"" in which surveillance eases and complacency returns.  The Ipac predicted such attacks might occur outside East Java, especially in areas around the West Java-Central Java border, such as West Java's Cirebon and Indramayu, as well as Central Java's Tegal, which was described by the researchers as regions where a ""critical mass of supporters was still active"", showing a high degree of militancy.  The areas, the report said, have been producing terrorists since the deadly Thamrin attack in Jakarta in January 2016.  Related Story Indonesian cleric Aman Abdurrahman sentenced to death for inciting terror attacks  Poso in Central Sulawesi also came under the spotlight in the Ipac report, especially after earthquakes and a tsunami hit the province on Sept 28, causing several prisoners to escape. While some returned, others are still at large to date.  ""It is also not impossible that extremists could see the area as fertile recruiting ground, given unhappiness with the slow pace of aid deliveries and a well-entrenched extremist network in the area,"" the report said.  University of Indonesia (UI) terrorist expert Ridwan Habib echoed the sentiment and warned that attacks might come ahead of the 2019 general election.  In August, the South Jakarta District Court declared JAD a ""forbidden organisation"" and found it guilty of committing a number of terror acts.  The ruling enables the police and their counter-terrorism squad Densus 88 to use newly added provisions in the Terrorism Law to prosecute individuals who intentionally recruit for or join an organisation declared a terror group by the court.  As of Sunday (Oct 21), the police had conducted dozens of raids on suspected JAD members, including in the latest operation in North Sumatra.  The North Sumatra Police said last Friday that its personnel killed two suspected terrorists and JAD members, and seized makeshift bombs, weapons and ammunition during a raid in Tanjung Balai, a day before they allegedly plotted attacks on temples and police stations in the city.  Mr Ridwan, however, said law enforcement had yet to be effective in eradicating terror groups.  ""The arrest in Tanjung Balai indicates there is coordination between JAD members and attempts to build bombs are still ongoing. There is no deterrent effect,"" he said.  The Ipac also criticised the police's capability of monitoring people suspected of having a connection with terror groups, saying that ""surveillance of the (Surabaya bombing) perpetrators had stopped about three months before the attacks"".  According to the report, JAD Surabaya leader Dita Oepriarto had shown more signs of deliberate interaction with neighbours to present an image of ""normal, pious Muslims"", while at the same time Dita had allegedly been assembling at least 100 pipe bombs.  Dita, the suspected mastermind behind the suicide bombings in all three churches in Surabaya, blew himself up in one of the attacks.

His beard neatly buzzed, Sufyan is one of hundreds of foreigners held by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in war-torn Syria, accused of fighting for ISIS.  The 36-year-old insists he was not a fighter, but a misguided civilian making orthopaedic shoes and prosthetics in ISIS territory.  ""I am not Jihadi John, I am not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, I am not Adnani,"" said Sufyan, listing ISIS's infamous British executioner, its elusive chief, and its now-dead spokesman.  ""I just made limbs,"" added the pale-skinned Sufyan, who refused to give his real name and said he was from Stuttgart in south-west Germany.  He was selected to speak to AFP by the YPG, who detained him around a year ago and were present during the interview.  They have refused to try accused foreign fighters in their custody, urging Western countries to take them back.  Some foreign governments have agreed to do so, but most are reluctant.  The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces are holding several alleged German ISIS members, including Mohammad Haydar Zammar, a Syrian-born German national accused of helping plan the Sept 11 attacks.  Berlin is not known to have repatriated anyone, but Sufyan hopes he, his Syrian wife and their son can start afresh in Germany.  ""People make mistakes and I was naive,"" he said, dressed in a yellow hoody with a side zip, cargo pants, and black beanie.  ""I just want to go back to my old life.""  'I didn't fight'  Speaking in near-fluent English peppered with Arabic words, Sufyan recounts his winding journey to what he thought would be a pious life under Islamic rule.  In 2014, ISIS declared a ""caliphate"" across large parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq.  The following year, Sufyan travelled across Europe and Turkey, finally crossing into Syria in March 2015, four years into the Syrian war.  Once inside, he says, ISIS shuffled him among safe houses for weeks alongside Australians, Central Asians, and Russians.  He was given one month of military training and assigned to a battalion, but claims he never fought.  ""I didn't fight and I didn't kill anyone,"" he said.  ""I never killed any person in my life.""  Instead, Sufyan was hired at a hospital in ISIS's de facto Syrian capital Raqa, using his 12 years' experience as an orthopaedic shoemaker.  ""They teach me over there prosthetics. Until I came to YPG, I was doing this job... making prosthetic and orthopaedic shoes,"" he said.  In 2016, he married a Syrian woman from north-west Idlib, and they had a son.  They stayed in Raqa until YPG-led forces surrounded the northern city in 2017, forcing them to flee to the ISIS-held eastern town of Mayadeen.  Sufyan took up the same work there until Mayadeen came under attack, this time by the Russia-backed Syrian regime.  He said he had grown embittered towards ISIS by then and decided to pay a smuggler to bring him and his family to a YPG checkpoint.  ""I was not ready to kill someone or to die, so I decided to go out,"" said Sufyan. ""Everyone was running away."" .  'New start'?  A year later, Sufyan lives separated from his wife and son, who are detained in a Kurdish-run camp. He desperately wants to be reunited with his family.  Kurdish authorities say they have in their custody around 520 male foreign ISIS members, 550 women and around 1,200 children from 44 countries.  According to a European Parliament report in May, Germany estimates there are 290 children with claims to German citizenship in Iraq and Syria.  ""If I can come back to Germany and if Germany want to punish me, I will accept this, to stay in prison,"" Sufyan told AFP.  ""I hope it will not be a long sentence, because I miss already my wife and my son,"" he said.  He hopes to study or open his own business in his homeland, for which he has renewed appreciation since meeting Syrians who ""see Germany as something like a paradise on earth"".  ""I know Germany is a country with a lot of 'rahma' with a lot of people. I expect that Germany will have also 'rahma' with me,"" he said, using the Arabic word for ""mercy"".  Sufyan has written to his parents in Germany, who replied and also sent a letter and money to his wife.  Included in his parents' reply was a picture of a bicycle, which has kept Sufyan's hopes of returning home alive.  ""My brain says, why will my mother and my father buy a bicycle for my son if he is in Syria? I hope I can go back to my country and make a new start.""",en,terrorattack,,

In August, the South Jakarta District Court declared JAD a ""forbidden organisation"" and found it guilty of committing a number of terror acts. The ruling enables the police and their counter-terrorism squad Densus 88 to use newly added provisions in the Terrorism Law to prosecute individuals who intentionally recruit for or join an organisation declared a terror group by the court.  The North Sumatra police said last Friday that its personnel killed two suspected terrorists and JAD members during a raid in Tanjung Balai, a day before they allegedly plotted attacks on temples and police stations in the city.  The Ipac criticised the police's capability of monitoring people suspected of having a connection with terror groups, saying that ""surveillance of the (Surabaya bombing) perpetrators had stopped about three months before the attacks"".  According to the report, JAD Surabaya leader Dita Oepriarto had shown more signs of interaction with neighbours to present an image of ""normal, pious Muslims"" during which he had allegedly been assembling at least 100 pipe bombs. The suspected mastermind behind the suicide bombings in all three churches in Surabaya, he blew himself up in one of the attacks.  ""It was this willingness to engage with the community that became one factor in the police's decision to stop surveillance,"" the Ipac said.

2247977,straitstimes,None,"Age-old, sexually transmitted disease making a comeback, Europe News & Top Stories",http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/age-old-sexually-transmitted-disease-making-a-comeback,16/11/2018 9:33,16/11/2018 12:45,"LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - New Zealand managed to quell an infectious child-killer with the help of a new type of vaccine.  A decade later, scientists in the South Pacific nation found it may be critical combating an age-old, sexually transmitted infection that's making a comeback: gonorrhoea.  That's spurring optimism that the fast-spreading disease could be slowed using a vaccine already on the market to prevent its bacterial cousin - a strain of the so-called meningococcal bacterium notorious for causing potentially deadly meningitis epidemics in college dorms, such as the recent ones on campuses in San Diego and Massachusetts.  While gonorrhoea isn't life-threatening, it's now on the verge of becoming unstoppable due to antibiotic resistance.  Doctors are also reporting that strains of gonorrhoea are behaving like related infections that persist in the throat, where the germs can spread surreptitiously via kissing.  That's adding to the urgency of finding new ways to stop the scourge, which has widened its hold on minority groups, including gay men, to the broader community.  Cases jumped 19 per cent in the US last year, with similar trends noted around the world.  While no immunisation against gonorrhoea exists, studies show that a licensed vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline Plc may offer at least partial protection.  'LOTS OF QUESTIONS'  ""Next to the development of a new drug or something like that, there is nothing,"" said Dr Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland, who worked with colleagues to show, for the first time, that a custom-made meningococcal B shot was associated with protection against the STI known colloquially as the Clap.  Related Story Drug-resistant sexually transmitted infections not a problem in Singapore - yet  Related Story STDs that resist drugs not seen in S'pore yet  Related Story New method gives men more privacy for STD screening  ""This has opened up a whole programme of work that needs to be done with lots of questions to be answered.""  The shot that New Zealand used to immunise 1.1 million people from 2004 to 2006 in people six months to 20 years of age was different to typical meningococcal vaccines.  It was aimed at stimulating antibodies against an additional feature common to both germs called outer membrane vesicles. Scientists speculate this may be an important source of cross protection.  No one knows yet how that cross protection might work or for how long. Answering those questions is key to determining whether vaccines targeting these outer membrane vesicles, like Glaxo's Bexsero, might help mitigate the spread of gonorrhoea.  'UNPACKING THE MAGIC'  ""It's basically unpacking the magic of finding out what it is,"" Dr Petousis-Harris said over the phone from Auckland.  Her paper in the Lancet medical journal last year estimated vaccination against meningococcal B resulted in 31 per cent effectiveness against gonorrhoea.  That invigorated interest in the field, according to researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Uniformed Services University in Maryland.  ""While Bexsero may not be the exact answer, we're a lot closer to an answer for a gonorrhoea vaccine than we have been in a long time,"" said Dr Leah Vincent, a scientist at the institute, in a telephone interview.  US$166 SHOT  GlaxoSmithKline hasn't yet made a decision on whether to target gonorrhoea with Bexsero, which is forecast to generate $780 million (S$1.07 billion) in sales this year purely as a meningococcal B vaccine. The product has a retail price in the US of about US$166 per dose.  The drug-maker is reviewing the results of independent studies and talking with health authorities and outside researchers about potentially evaluating Bexsero as a way of preventing gonorrhoea, the London-based company said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Meantime, it's advancing development of the antibiotic gepotidacin to treat the disease after completing two mid-stage studies.  ""GSK is aware of the increasing public health need for prevention of gonorrhoea, particularly in light of antimicrobial resistance, and is exploring ways to contribute our expertise to this important issue,"" the company said.  Gonorrhea cases have jumped six-fold in major Australian cities over the past decade, and 78 million new infections occur worldwide each year.  The standard two-drug regimen costs US$21.66 per treatment in low and middle-income countries, Dr Vincent and Dr Ann Jerse, from the Uniformed Services University, wrote in a paper published in April.  Establishing a patient trial with a two-dose Bexsero regimen targeting American adolescents could prevent almost 84,000 infections and save almost US$70 million in total costs, they said.  The sexually transmitted bacteria develops antibiotic resistance rapidly compared with other organisms, Dr Jerse said over the phone.  ""Even though there are drugs in the pipeline, it's just going to be a short-term solution. That's why a vaccine is really important, and the time is now.""  Gonorrhea uses a specific protein to defeat the body's first line of defence, Dr Jerse and colleagues at the Oregon State University's College of Pharmacy said in July, opening up a new pathway to develop both novel antibiotics and vaccines.  INFERTILITY, BLINDNESS  Gonorrhea, an ancient disease recognised in the second century by the Greek physician Galen, often causes no symptoms, especially in the throat, enabling it to spread unnoticed.  Left untreated, the disease can cause a raft of complications from infertility and ectopic pregnancies, to premature births and blindness.  Cases of gonorrhoea for which no standard therapy currently exists have been detected in Australia and the UK, the House of Commons in London said in a report last month. Health authorities have warned of more extreme cases to come.  ""Like many diseases, we forget how bad they were,"" said Dr Kate Seib, who helped develop Bexsero in Siena, Italy, for Novartis AG, which sold the vaccine to Glaxo in 2015.  ""But it doesn't kill anyone, so people still aren't worried.""  No study has yet proven that Bexsero can prevent gonorrhoea, Dr Seib said.  Findings in New Zealand, Cuba and Quebec that show a link between vaccination and a subsequent reduction in gonorrhoea are ""very promising, but just an observation"", she said.  A quick way to discern whether a vaccine could reduce the risk of gonorrhoea would be to test Bexsero in a randomised controlled trial among thousands of gay and bisexual men taking a pill to prevent HIV, Dr Seib said.  So called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, has helped drive down AIDS-causing infections, but is associated with an annual risk of gonorrhoea reaching 40 per cent.  If such a study was successful, the results would need to be validated in a larger, general population, which would be ""exceptionally expensive"" to conduct, said Dr Charlene Kahler, head of infection and immunity at the University of Western Australia's School of Biomedical Sciences in Perth.  The bacterial causes of meningococcal disease and gonorrhoea share 80-90 per cent of their DNA, and results of studies using animal models back the use of Bexsero for controlling gonorrhoea also.  Still, measuring success is challenging since there is no known way to gauge protection against gonorrhoea in humans, Dr Kahler said in a telephone interview.  Even a modest level of effect from a vaccine could stem the ""almost exponential"" increase in gonorrhoea worldwide and slow the evolution of drug-resistant cases, said Professor Christopher Fairley, director of the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre.  ""We have to stop expecting that saying to people 'reduce the number of partners and use condoms' will work because it's not working,"" said Prof Fairley, who is also a professor of public health at Melbourne's Monash University, in an interview.  ""We have to face up to that reality. We have to start exploring other methods.""",en,diseas,,

With the help of U.S. jets and special forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance is battling the remnants of Islamic State in an enclave near the Iraqi border.  The SDF restored positions it had lost to attacks in recent days, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Battles raged on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river on Sunday.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SDF did regain back a lot of territory lost the other day,Ã¢â‚¬Â Colonel Sean Ryan, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, told Reuters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Both sides took casualties.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Iraqi security forces are securing the border so no fighters can escape, he added.  The SDF, which the Kurdish YPG militia leads, has seized vast territory from the jihadists across northern and eastern Syria, where some 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed.  SDF officials were not immediately available for comment.  Islamic StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-proclaimed caliphate has crumbled after different offensives in Iraq and Syria, but its fighters still operate in the desert border region and mount attacks.  Syrian state news agency SANA said coalition warplanes killed 14 people Ã¢â‚¬Å“in a new massacreÃ¢â‚¬Â in al-Shaafa village. Air strikes had killed 20 other people, including nine children, in the nearby town of Hajin, it said a day earlier.  The U.S.-led coalition says it seeks to avoid civilian casualties and investigates any allegations. Colonel Ryan said on Saturday that strikes were limited and had not affected civilians.  The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 31 civilians in the past two days, as well as 50 Islamic State and 79 SDF combatants.  Islamic State released a graphic video overnight showing its militants beheading a hostage and threatening the families of SDF fighters.  Its media outlet Amaq on Saturday said the jihadists staged attacks on two fronts, killing dozens of Kurdish milita fighters and taking 30 others hostage.  Separately, in the northwest, more than 100 people were wounded in a suspected toxic gas attack in Aleppo city, which Damascus and Moscow blamed on rebel factions.

It's not clear who carried out the attack, but Syria's state news agency quoted a local commander as blaming ""terrorist groups,"" while Russia accused militants of firing mortar rounds containing chlorine on the city's northwestern districts.  Nasr al-Hariri, the head of the Syrian opposition negotiation delegation to Geneva, told Saudi owned al-Hadath TV that the attack on Aleppo originated from an area controlled by pro-regime Iranian militias.  On Twitter he wrote that ""the regime and its allies are using this as an excuse to launch a military operation in north Syria.""  The reported attack on Aleppo is the first since Russia and Turkey agreed to establish a demilitarized zone in the rebel-controlled Idlib province, according to UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).  Rights groups said an investigation into the attack was needed and called on Russia and Syria to allow a neutral third party to look into it.  ""Serious reports of suspected chemical weapon attacks should not be left without investigation,"" Lama Fakih, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Human Rights Watch said in a statement.  ""All parties, including the Syrian government and Russia, should facilitate an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons into the suspected attack in Aleppo which reportedly affected dozens, including children. All parties should stop the use of prohibited weapons and attacks on civilians.""  The Syrian army responded by shelling the source of the attack, SANA reported, without providing additional details. Russian warplanes hit Syrian rebel targets, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.  Toxic air  SOHR said 94 civilians, including dozens of children, suffered from asphyxiation following the toxic gas attack in Aleppo. The group said explosions had been heard as shells fell on the western part of the city.  Citing hospital sources, SANA reported 107 people were injured in the gas attack, ranging from mild to medium in severity.  Russian state media also reported injuries from the attack, saying that 46 people, including eight children, suffered from exposure to gas. It added that Russian chemical weapons specialists had been deployed to provide relief to the city's affected residents.  Other gas attacks  The attack, if confirmed, would not be the first time gas has been used in the Syrian conflict.  The groups -- including the White Helmets, the Douma Coordination Committee and the Ghouta Media Center -- said toxic gas inside barrel bombs dropped by helicopters over Douma caused people to suffocate and choke.  Syrian state news agency SANA cited an ""official source"" who denied the allegations, and citing the same sources wrote that the Syrian Arab Army ""does not need to use any chemical materials as claimed by terrorists' media affiliates.""  First attack since buffer zone created  Announcing the demilitariazation agreement in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the creation of a 15- to 20-kilometer (approximately nine to 12 miles) demilitarized zone would prevent a ""humanitarian crisis"" in the northwestern province.  However, shelling from the regime and the rebels has killed and injured dozens of civilians and militants, according to the SOHR.",en,terrorattack,539,"['Syria', 'Aleppo']"

During the demonstrations in the Afghan capital, the protesters opened fire at the police, wounding four policemen. Deputy interior minister Gen. Akhtar Mohammad Ibrahimi said 44 policemen were also injured when protesters hurled stones and other hard objects at them.  The Taliban ambush took place in western Farah province on Sunday afternoon. Along with 20 policemen killed, four were wounded, including the deputy provincial police chief, said Dadullah Qaneh, a member of the provincial council.  The convoy was on its way to the district of Lash wa Juwayn to introduce newly appointed district police chief when it came under attack, said another council member, Abdul Samad Salehi. The newly appointed chief was also killed, said Qaneh.  In northern Faryab province, the Taliban attacked an army check point in Qaisar district, killing 10 troops, said Mohammad Tahir Rahmani, head of the provincial council. Three soldiers were wounded while the fate of five others was unknown.  The Taliban, who in recent years have taken over nearly half of Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the Farah attack, the latest in a series of brutal, near-daily Taliban assaults on Afghan military and security forces throughout the country. The insurgents made no statement on the Faryab assault.  The Taliban view the U.S.-backed government in Kabul as a dysfunctional Western puppet and have refused repeated offers to negotiate with it.  The protesters in western Kabul were rallying to denounce the arrest of Abdul Ghani Alipoor, a Shiite militia leader in western Ghor province. The Afghan intelligence service accuses Alipoor of leading an illegal armed group that is behind extortion and other mafia-like behavior in the region.  On Sunday, hundreds clashed with police during a similar Shiite protest in Kabul. In that demonstration, three policemen were shot and wounded and 20 were injured by stones thrown by protesters who also torched two police checkpoints.  Beside Kabul, there were also protests on Monday in northern Balkh and central Bamyan provinces but no reports of violence there.  ""I can hear sporadic sound of shooting form the area,"" said lawmaker Nasrullah Sadeqizada of Monday's protest in Kabul. The member of parliament lives near the area and spoke to The Associated Press over the phone.  Mahobullah, a resident form the area who uses only one name, said hundreds of protesters were carrying posters of Alipoor, shouting: ""Alipoor is innocent"" and demanding that he be set free.  During a previous attempt to arrest Alipoor, in June, security forces in Ghor clashed with his followers, leading to the deaths of seven civilians and four policemen.",en,terrorattack,,
2288083,aljazeera,Azad Essa,Why Ebola crisis in DRC is unlike anything before,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/ebola-crisis-drc-181125140426233.html,,28/11/2018 4:31,"It is the worst Ebola outbreak to have struck the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - and the most complex one.  Since August, authorities in the country, together with a host of partners, have been trying to contain a new outbreak of the disease in the eastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces.  As of November 21, there have been 373 suspected cases of Ebola, including 347 confirmed cases. At least 217 people have already died.  There have been 10 outbreaks of Ebola since 1976 in the DRC, which is considered among the most experienced in dealing with the virus.  The situation this time, though, is different.  The North Kivu and Ituri provinces are among the most unstable and densely populated in the country, and subject to some of the highest levels of human mobility in it.  At the same time, there are warnings that a ""perfect storm"" of insecurity, community resistance about vaccinations and political manipulation threaten the efforts to contain the spread of the virus.  These factors collectively make the latest outbreak, unlike anything the DRC, which is scheduled to hold a crucial presidential election on December 23, has experienced before.  What is Ebola and how does it spread?  The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of infected animals. These include, but are not limited to, monkeys or fruit bats.  The virus is known to cause high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, as well as internal and external bleeding; it puts the body into a state of shock and results in a decrease of the perfusion of blood to vital organs, ultimately inducing multi-system organ failure.  Once infected, patients have a very low chance of surviving.  When did the latest outbreak in the DRC begin?  In late July 2018, the provincial government of North Kivu reported 26 cases of acute haemorrhagic fever that had resulted in 20 deaths.  {articleGUID}  Six specimens of blood were sent to the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in the capital, Kinshasa, where four samples tested positive for the Ebola virus.  ""The result of the genetic analysis by INRB confirmed Ebola Zaire strain, but not linked to the Equateur outbreak strain, meaning that we are dealing with a new outbreak,"" Lianne Gutcher, a communications officer with the World Health Organization (WHO), told Al Jazeera.  The country's Ministry of Health officially declared an outbreak on August 1, 2018.  The centre of the outbreak is now Beni in North Kivu, though the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French initials MSF, has warned that there is a possibility it could move to Butembo, a town close to neighbouring Uganda.  How does this outbreak compare with previous ones in the DRC?  Ebola is considered endemic in the DRC, with the first cases in 1976 appearing simultaneously in Yambuku - in the north of the country near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name - and Nzara, in what is now South Sudan.  While there is still no cure, the introduction of a vaccination programme earlier this year has been touted as the next step towards a more effective management of future outbreaks.  The DRC has been hit by two outbreaks this year.  The first one was declared in May after the deaths of 29 people in the city of Mbandaka in the Equateur province. Though there were concerns the town's proximity to the Congo River would see the virus moving to Kinshasa, the timely implementation of a vaccination drive saw the virus quickly contained.  That outbreak was announced over on July 24.  Both Uganda and the DRC have been able to prevent mammoth epidemics spreading as it did in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 that infected 28,000 people and caused 11,300 deaths. But given that the current outbreak in North Kivu is perhaps the first time the virus has spread into an area already home to a large-scale humanitarian crisis, containing the spread of Ebola this time around is proving to be a lot more difficult.  It is already the largest outbreak in the DRC and is on course to become the second largest Ebola outbreak ever.  ""The difference is that we are now operating in a war zone,"" Axelle Ronsse, the emergency coordinator for MSF's Ebola response, told Al Jazeera, referring to the militia violence that has long plagued parts of the country's east.  How has the security crisis impacted efforts to contain the virus?  North Kivu is home to a number of armed groups, including the Allied Defence Forces (ADF), a Ugandan rebel group, that has operated with impunity since 1995.  The endless upheavals in the region have meant regular dispossession and the incessant movement of refugees to neighbouring countries or within the province itself. As it stands, there are more than a million internally displaced people in North Kivu.  ""The violence impacts our work on a daily basis,"" Ronsse says. ""We are not targeted but it is a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.""  Likewise, Gutcher, from the WHO, says that some attacks have resulted in medical activities being severely impeded or temporarily shut down.  ""Community violence has also at times impeded the work of safe burial teams' ability to conduct safe and dignified burials.""  {articleGUID}  In October, rebels killed 13 civilians and kidnapped a dozen children in an assault on Beni.  In November, seven Malawian and one Tanzanian peacekeeper were killed in another attack on the town.  The instability has also made it difficult for health professionals to locate others who might have been in contact with suspected victims, in what is known as ""contact tracing"", considered a basic pillar of any effort to contain Ebola.  Last month, The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) wrote that ""carrying out the effective contact tracing and community engagement can permit rapid identification of people who are ill and facilitate the provision of early clinical care, which has been shown to improve the likelihood of survival.""  Jessica Ilunga, communications officer for the DRC's Ministry of Public Health, told Al Jazeera that every security-related incident affected field activities. She added that the underlying security context had also created a climate in which health workers faced an unprecedented level of community resistance.  ""The predominance of traditional healers, who are more trusted by the population than modern medicine, has also led to an important number of nosocomial transmissions of the virus,"" Ilunga said.  {articleGUID}  Citing the instability in the eastern DRC, the WHO elevated the national crisis to ""very high"" in late September. The crisis is still not considered a public health emergency of international concern and the world health body does not recommend imposing any trade or travel restrictions with the DRC.  How have the DRC and the international community responded to this crisis?  Since the introduction of the vaccination programme by the DRC's government and the WHO, a key intervention has involved vaccinating suspected patients and then administering a second ""ring"" to those who might have come into contact with these suspected cases.  The vaccine is Canadian-developed but licensed and produced by the American pharmaceutical company Merck.  According to the WHO, around 300 medical specialists have been deployed to the country to support the response plan. Around 32,500 people-at-risk have been vaccinated, including 10,600 health workers and 8,600 children.  On November 24, the government and the WHO said they would be conducting clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs used on Ebola patients to find the most effective treatment for the virus.  Authorities have already started using the drugs on a case-by-case basis on around 151 people. Those who used the drugs had a 63 percent chance of survival, while those who did not receive medication had a fatality rate close to 80 percent.  ""Now that protocols for trials are in place, patients will be offered treatments under that framework in the facilities where the trial has started,"" the WHO said.  {articleGUID}  Over and above vaccinations and drugs, efforts have been made to spread information through door-to-door advocacy, with more than 2,500 homes visited, including almost 1,400 homes in Beni alone.  ""Faced with rumours and misinformation, some families have chosen to care for sick relatives at home; some patients leave healthcare centres to find alternatives or actively avoid follow up,"" Gutcher says.  Authorities have also trained around 1,700 volunteers to assist with community-based efforts. Across the border in Uganda, 758 health workers in 19 health facilities have been vaccinated.  In mid-November, the WHO said that the outbreak would end in mid-2019.  But Ilunga, from the DRC's Ministry of Public Health, says her government is hopeful that the efforts to contain the outbreak would succeed sooner than the WHO's target, but concedes that ""the success of this response also depends on a number of factors that we do not control, such as security"".  Why do outbreaks continue to occur in the DRC?  Microbiologists argue that viruses such as Ebola often occur among animal populations faced with restricted movement.  However, health professionals are concerned that should the Ebola become endemic to the troubled areas in the northeastern DRC, it would mean ""a sustained and unpredictable spread of the deadly virus, with major implications for travel and trade"".  ""This will mean that we've lost the ability to trace contacts, stop transmission chains and contain the outbreak,"" Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in a briefing earlier in November.  For her part, Ilunga says the country needs to accept the fact that the disease ""will resurface regularly"" and ""make preventive and curative treatments more available and improve the population's knowledge about the virus"".",en,diseas,,

Worried about being kidnapped, they turned back, the latest in a series of setbacks in their attempts to contain the central African country's worst outbreak of the deadly virus.  As fighting has worsened between rival militia seeking control of land and natural resources, vaccinations and vital treatments have increasingly been delayed and Ebola has spread.  The situation has become so dangerous in eastern Congo that humanitarian workers were temporarily evacuated last month from their base in the town of Beni in the North Kivu region close to Rwanda and Uganda.  With the vast country of more than 80 million people also suffering from political instability and facing a refugee crisis, World Health Organization experts see it as one of the most complex public health challenges in recent history.  ""Sometimes in the field we hear bullets flying left to right and we tell ourselves maybe it is going to hit one of us,"" said Mimi Kambere, emergency response coordinator for nonprofit group Oxfam, whose team was confronted by the men with machetes.  ""Sometimes the insecurity pushes us not to respond to calls, and not to go into certain areas for days,"" she told Reuters in Goma, the town on the northern shores of Lake Kivu to which she and other health workers were evacuated on Nov. 17.  Congo's tenth outbreak since Ebola was discovered in 1976 has infected 422 people and killed 241 in the last four months. It will become the second largest outbreak of the disease if it surpasses the 425 cases recorded in Uganda in 2000, according to Congo health ministry records.  The disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids and causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding. In many flare-ups, more than half of cases are fatal. In the worst outbreak, which began in 2013, more than 11,000 people were killed in three years, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.  Tracking contacts of patients and immunising them with a preventative vaccine swiftly contained an Ebola outbreak in a peaceful area of western Congo this year. This raised hopes that new ways of fighting Ebola could reduce its deadliness, even in urban areas.  But in what a World Health Organization official in Geneva called ""a potential perfect storm"", densely populated North Kivu is now at the epicentre of both the fighting and Ebola.  A WHO emergency committee said in October that the outbreak was likely to worsen significantly unless the response was stepped up. In November, the number of new cases rose, and the virus spread into previously untouched areas.  An internal note by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNHCR), which was seen by Reuters, recorded 28 violent incidents affecting Ebola response teams between August and November.  DEATH THREATS  International and Congolese health workers are not only hampered by gunfire. They often face what the WHO calls ""reluctance, refusal and resistance"" by some Congolese to accept treatment.  Some Congolese believe medics come to spread the disease with their vaccination needles. Others do not believe the virus exists at all. A number of medics, especially local staff, have received verbal death threats and have had rocks thrown at their cars, they told Reuters.  Such actions, the WHO says, are driven by fear of Ebola and are being exploited by local politicians before a presidential election due in December.  Those that do seek medical help often find themselves in unsanitary medical facilities where the virus spreads, medics said.  Humanitarian workers' scope for action is also limited by the shortening of the working day under curfews imposed by the government, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the U.N. because of the fighting.  This delays crucial services such as blood tests and safe burials of Ebola victims to help prevent the virus spreading.  ""Armed groups that attack Beni pose an enormous obstacle for our staff,"" said Michel Yao, the WHO's incident manager in Beni.  In some areas, the WHO must seek permission from armed groups to access new patients. Negotiations via phone to secure safe passage can delay vital early care, Yao said, and interrupt vaccination plans.  ""We never had to negotiate access to patients before. It's a specificity of this Ebola outbreak,"" Yao said.  WHO staff, along with representatives of the World Food Programme and aid agency UNICEF, were among dozens of people evacuated for psychological evaluation after fighting in Beni two weeks ago in which 12 Congolese soldiers and seven U.N. peacekeepers were killed, the WHO said.  Gunfire came close to the town's Ebola Emergency Center and a hotel housing humanitarian workers. A shell landed on a building where WHO staff were staying but did not explode.  ""It was scary because normally violence is not that close,"" said a UNICEF employee who asked not to be named.  To avoid stray bullets, he followed advice he was given in training.  ""I entered my room and crouched in the shower. I was stuck in the shower for three hours,"" he said.  FAST WORK IS VITAL  Effectively containing Ebola involves fast work under pressure: health workers must check all possible new cases, take blood samples, isolate the sick and track everyone a patient has been in contact with.  A slow international response contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola in West Africa in 2013, the outbreak that developed into the worst so far.  In Congo, visiting potential patients often means driving for many hours along pitted country roads, health workers said. In eastern Congo that can mean danger.  A laboratory in Beni receives between 50 and 70 blood samples each day from health workers in the field, but testing those samples has slowed because of the time restrictions imposed by the curfews, said Congo health ministry spokeswoman Jessica Llunga.  ""Until we have confirmation that the patient has Ebola, we cannot transfer him to a centre and we cannot vaccinate his contacts, which also hampers the fight against the epidemic,"" she said.

2301199,cnn,Susan Scutti,"Congo Ebola outbreak is 2nd largest, 2nd deadliest",https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/health/drc-ebola-update-who-bn/index.html,29/11/2018 0:00,30/11/2018 13:04,"(CNN) The current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- with 426 total cases, including 245 deaths -- is now the second largest and second deadliest in history, according to Thursday's report from the nation's Ministry of Health.  A 2000-01 outbreak in Uganda included 425 cases and caused 224 deaths, according to the World Health Organization . The deadliest outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.  ""This is a milestone nobody wanted to hit,"" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic wrote in an email. On average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but case fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo, which began in August, has a case fatality rate of 57%.  Of the total cases, 379 have been confirmed, and 47 are probable, according to the ministry. An additional 87 suspected cases are under investigation.  On a positive note, 126 patients have recovered, the ministry said.  This is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo, where the virus is endemic, and the second this year.  neighboring Ituri province, according to WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. North Kivu province , which includes the cities Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported inneighboring Ituri province, according to WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.  ""The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high,"" WHO said in a statement Thursday  However, there have been no confirmed cases in Congo's neighbors, Jasarevic said. ""All neighboring countries have implemented heightened surveillance and are detecting and investigating alerts and suspected Ebola cases.""  Cases continue to mushroom  Recent spread of the infection to people in Butembo, a city that's home to 1.2 million, ""raised concerns,"" wrote Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor and faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law, and his co-authors in an editorial published online Thursday in the medical journal JAMA.  Seeing ""gaps in the response,"" Gostin and his co-authors recommend that the United States and allies ""mobilize high-level political attention and resources for the Ebola response"" and ""develop a plan to deploy public health personnel to North Kivu.""  In October, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel who had been stationed in Congo had been pulled back from the worst affected areas due to safety concerns, a US government official familiar with the situation said at the time  Not only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.  A senior White House official confirmed this month that US government personnel who had been working on the ground in Beni had been evacuated to other parts of Congo due to safety concerns. The official said that the situation is being evaluated constantly and that in the meantime, the US continues to provide technical and financial assistance to contain the outbreak.  Jasarevic described the overall environment as ""complex and challenging.""  ""On Friday, 16 November, a second attack in one week occurred in Beni,"" he reported. ""UN peacekeepers and government forces engaged with rebel forces. By Sunday, November 18 all activities in Beni were re-launched, including vaccination.""  Jasarevic says the response in areas outside Beni has not been affected by conflict, but WHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola.  Despite such risks and safety concerns, Congo's response effort has been robust. The Ministry of Health has 900 people active in the response, according to Jasarevic, and of these, 85% are from the local area. Additionally, WHO has deployed 300 of its own staff to the region.  The latest minstry report indicates that 37,559 people have received an experimental vaccine in a campaign that began August 8. ""This includes over 11,100 health and frontline workers, and 9,300 children,"" Jasarevic said.  The experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to WHO.  Gostin and his co-authors are doubtful. ""Despite deploying an experimental vaccine, cases doubled in October 2018,"" they wrote. More generally, they believe that the overall response, which also includes contact tracing and investigational treatments, may not be adequate.  'Cascading transmission' of the disease  ""Of 137 confirmed cases between October 28 and November 26, only 19 were found through contact tracing, 32 were on contact lists but lost to follow-up, and 83 (61%) had no known links to confirmed cases,"" Gostin and his co-authors wrote. ""These data suggest contact tracing and vaccination have not prevented cascading transmission.""  Gostin also believes that ""community distrust is deep after decades-long humanitarian crises, impeding information-sharing and cooperation."" They note that WHO and UN pledged enhanced security operations this month, ""yet lethal attacks have persisted.""  Nora Love, field director for the International Rescue Committee's operations in the region, offers a more nuanced view.  From mid-September through the end of last week, the nonprofit humanitarian group has trained over 730 health care workers who staff the dozens of health care facilities between the group's two field offices in Beni and Butembo.  ""It's a very lush green area that rains every day, and the temperatures are pretty nice, but it's definitely a city at the edge of a country, and you can see that it also has been under conflict. There's definitely a tension within the communities here,"" Love said. ""You know that you're in a conflict area. There's always some sort of insecurity happening every single day.""  Despite this, she does not feel ""unwelcome here from the community,"" she said, and she does not feel under threat because she works within health facilities, ""which are a little bit more isolated than going to a village.""  Getting ahead of an infectious disease  ""The people who are doing the safe burials have been the most exposed and the most vulnerable because people are very emotional after they lost a loved one,"" Love said. ""And the protocols for safe burial are different than the traditional burials here, and that causes some distress within the community.""  Traditional burials involve touching the body of the deceased. To prevent spread of the infectious disease, safe burials require protective equipment and sanitizing the family's environment.  Still, Love has witnessed ""violent reactions"" at hospitals and health facilities when deaths occur. Patients have been forcefully removed from the hospital by their loved ones, she said.  ""Last week, they went to a hospital when somebody died, and they did vandalism and burned some things,"" Love said. ""Luckily, so far, no health workers have been harmed by this, but there's always a watching and being aware that it could flare up.""  Violence is not the only challenge, as Beni has recently experienced a ""significant increase"" in the number of malaria cases, according to a recent report from the Ministry of Health.  Love's main frustration has been the difficulty of getting ""ahead of things. Just when we feel we've made strides in one location, then the outbreak has moved somewhere else,"" she said. As a result, her organization has been exploring new strategies to see whether it can become more flexible and more rapid in its response.  Meanwhile, the larger response persists. Health care workers continue with vaccination efforts as WHO along with Congo conducts its first randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the experimental drugs offered under ""compassionate use"" to treat Ebola patients.

WHO said it remains ""focused on the ongoing containment efforts to end the outbreak"" and recommends that neighboring provinces and countries ""enhance surveillance and preparedness activities.""  ""We want to make sure that the international community does have its eyes on it and not just the UN,"" Love said.  Jasarevic remains hopeful: ""We are confident that working together with all our partners, we can and will end it.""",en,diseas,,

Bush could be seen in 2016 on a billboard one Bedouin family put up to announce their son's wedding.  That son being Bush al-Widhan, born in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War that saw U.S.-led forces expel the occupying Iraqi troops of dictator Saddam Hussein.  ""He was a real man, a lion,"" said Mubarak al-Widhan, the father of the Kuwaiti Bush, of the American president. ""He stood for our right for freedom, and he gave us back our country.""  With Bush's death , his legacy across the Middle East takes root in that 100-hour ground war that routed Iraqi forces. That war gave birth to the network of military bases America now operates across the Persian Gulf supporting troops in Afghanistan and forces fighting against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.  However, Bush ultimately would leave the Shiite and Kurdish insurgents he urged to rise up against Saddam in 1991 to face the dictator's wrath alone, leading to thousands of deaths. That mixed picture only extends to the presidency of his son, George W. Bush, who ordered the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that overthrew Saddam, whom he once famously described as ""the guy who tried to kill my dad one time.""  ""I feel tension in the stomach and in the neck ... but I also feel a certain calmness when we talk about these matters,"" the elder Bush once said about the 1991 Gulf War, according to biographer Jon Meacham. ""I know I am doing the right thing.""  Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, angry that the tiny neighbor and the United Arab Emirates had ignored OPEC quotas, which Saddam claimed cost his nation $14 billion. Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping crude from a disputed oil field and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion of debt that Iraq had accumulated during its 1980s war with Iran.  A World War II fighter pilot shot down fighting against the Japanese, Bush came to view Saddam as similar to Adolf Hitler, a madman who seized neighboring Kuwait and could plunge the world into conflict if he continued into Saudi Arabia. With Vietnam still a potent memory, Bush rallied together a coalition of nations to back the U.S. as it deployed troops to the region and began bombing runs. He talked Israel out of retaliating for Iraqi Scud missiles attacks for fear of alienating Arab allies.  ""This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait,"" Bush famously warned.  And it didn't.  On Feb. 24, 1991, U.S. troops and their allies stormed into Kuwait. It ended 100 hours later. America suffered only 148 combat deaths during the whole campaign, while over 20,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed.  In the aftermath of the campaign, some called for Bush to continue into Iraq and topple Saddam. Bush in speeches encouraged Iraqis to rise up against the dictator, while privately hoping someone within his own military would depose him.  ""To occupy Iraq would shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab world against us, and make a broken tyrant into a latter-day Arab hero,"" Bush later said. ""It would have taken us way beyond the imprimatur of international law, ... assigning young soldiers to a fruitless hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning them to fight in what would be an unwinnable urban guerrilla war.""  That hesitation allowed Saddam to regain the upper hand against insurgents and caused a refugee crisis in Iraq's northern Kurdish region. The dictator tauntingly installed a tile mosaic of a scowling likeness of the president at the door of Baghdad's al-Rashid Hotel, which forced entering foreign dignitaries to often step on his face just above its ""Bush is criminal"" caption.  Even Iran, which hated Saddam for starting their 1980s war, remained suspicious of Bush despite his pledge of ""good will begets good will."" Iran leaned on Lebanon's Shiite militants to help win the release American hostages like Terry Anderson of The Associated Press, but relations went no further. One of Bush's last acts as president, pardoning former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and others for their role in the Iran-Contra scandal, an offshoot of that hostage crisis.  Still, Bush's decisions in the 1991 war and its aftermath echo even now. The Kurdish crisis gave birth to the U.S.-imposed no-fly zone in northern Iraq that allowed the Kurds to flourish into the semi-autonomous region now demanding independence. Defense agreements with Gulf nations grew into a series of major military installations across the region. And the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia, home to the Muslim world's holiest sites, served as a chief complaint of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden ahead of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.  His son would launch the 2003 invasion of Iraq after 9/11 and become so hated in the Arab world an Iraq journalist would even throw a shoe at him during a news conference. But the elder Bush remained beloved, perhaps nowhere more than Kuwait, where Americans even today can get hugged while walking down the street. A group of Kuwaiti officials including the country's National Assembly speaker met with the former president in October 2017 to wish him well.  Today, the former president's Kuwaiti namesake Bush al-Widhan is happily married and works in the country's National Guard. His name still fascinates others.  ""I went with my father to Cleveland, Ohio, last year ... and the passport control clerk asked me about the name,"" al-Widhan recounted. ""I couldn't tell him the story. My English is bad. I said: 'George Bush, George Bush. Kuwait war.' Everyone thought it was a great name.""  ___  Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  ___  See AP's complete coverage of George H.W.

But after many from her community started visiting health clinics to get checked, she changed her mind.  ""I thought, 'I should go too',"" Mabrouk said, speaking at a clinic in the Mit Nama village near Cairo before learning she did not have the virus.  Advertisement  Egypt, which has the highest rate of hepatitis C in the world, is carrying out an unprecedented campaign to detect and treat the disease in a bid to eliminate it by 2022. It aims to test the entire adult population - about 50 million people.  Nearly 4.4 percent of adult Egyptians are infected and about 40,000 die of the disease every year, making it the country's third leading cause of death, according to the World Bank.  The campaign, which runs from October to April, also tests for diabetes and high blood pressure.  ""They are eliminating Egypt's two biggest health problems: Virus C and all the danger factors including the basic non-communicable diseases,"" said Jean Jabbour, the World Health Organization's representative in Egypt.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by a blood-borne virus. Most cases can be cured with antiviral medicine, but many do not initially show symptoms. If left untreated the virus can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer.  In Egypt, many were infected decades ago when poorly sterilized needles were used as part of a national treatment campaign against schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms.  Most donated blood is still not effectively screened, according to a recent World Bank report.  At least 11.5 million people have been screened in the new campaign, with 5 percent testing positive.  Large banners bearing health information and a picture of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi appeared in many Cairo streets as the campaign came to the capital on Saturday.  The campaign, which also treats those infected for free, is mainly funded by the World Bank. The bank has provided US$133 million for the tests and US$129 million for the treatment, according to a cabinet statement.  Due to lack of health clinics, some churches, mosques and youth centers also offer the blood test.  A church in the village of Begam, which like the Mit Nama village is in the Qalyubia province north of Cairo, serves as a health clinic every Sunday.  ""This initiative should have taken place much, much earlier, but it is good that the president thought of it now,"" said Ashyaa Abd al-Sayed, pastor at the church.  Unless the population is tested and treated in a single campaign, the disease won't be eliminated, said Health Minister Hala Zayed.  ""If you only test and treat parts of the population... then those who weren't treated might infect others,"" she said.  Globally, an estimated 71 million people suffer chronically from hepatitis C.

Since the outbreak began, the total number of probable cases is now 471, including 273 deaths, the ministry reported Thursday .  Public health authorities are investigating an additional 106 suspected cases, the ministry indicated.  Second-largest outbreak in history  This is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo, where the virus is endemic, and the second this year. It is also now the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, topped only by one in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.  On average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied.

Not only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.  ""Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a multifaceted challenge,"" WHO said in a report Thursday.  WHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola. Another complication: a high number of malaria cases in the region.  Gender imbalance  Women and children are disproportionately sick in the Ebola outbreak, WHO reported Thursday . To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.  The ""multitude of factors"" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO.  ""Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 out of 118),"" WHO noted. The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.  The ministry also reported that more than 41,000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August.

The US state department said the purpose was to ""undermine confidence"" in the ceasefire in Idlib province.  Syria and Russia said shells carrying chlorine gas injured about 100 people in the government-held city of Aleppo last month.  State media showed images of residents being treated in hospital.  Russia later carried out air strikes against the rebels it accused of the attack.  At the time, rebel groups denied carrying out a chemical strike and said the claims were a pretext for an attack on opposition-held areas.  On Friday, the US said it had ""credible information"" that the story was false and that Russian and Syrian forces had instead fired tear gas.  ""The United States is deeply concerned that pro-regime officials have maintained control of the attack site in its immediate aftermath, allowing them to potentially fabricate samples and contaminate the site before a proper investigation of it by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,"" state department spokesman Robert Palladino said.

But the extremist group has managed to retain a small pocket of land on the Syria-Iraq border for more than a year.  The militants have on occasion struck back with some of their former vigour from their toehold, around the Syrian town of Hajin in Deir el-Zour province.  In the last week of November, they staged a breakout from the Hajin pocket, attacking the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces in the Syrian town of Gharanij, which those forces had captured a year earlier.  The breakout on Nov 24 was a propaganda bonanza for the extremists, even though officials of the US-led coalition battling the ISIS said they were quickly beaten back.  Major-General Patrick Roberson, the United States military commander, said ISIS took advantage of bad weather and sandstorms, when airstrikes were not possible. ""As we degrade their capabilities and push them into an ever smaller box, ISIS continues to employ more and more desperate measures,"" Maj-Gen Roberson said. ""These tactics won't succeed.""  However, Mr Maxwell Markusen, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, warned against complacency.  ""US and Iraqi politicians have been quick to declare victory over the group, using terms like defeated and obliterated,"" he wrote in a report last month. ISIS ""is far from obliterated"", he added.  NOT OBLITERATED US and Iraqi politicians have been quick to declare victory over the group, using terms like defeated and obliterated... (ISIS) is far from obliterated. MR MAXWELL MARKUSEN, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, warning against complacency.  In 2014, ISIS dominated an area in Iraq and Syria the size of Britain. But by November last year, it was reduced to the pocket around Hajin, which is about the size of Manhattan. American officials described the militant group's remaining territory as only about 50 sq km.  On the Iraqi side of the border, the extremists have managed to set up surprise roadblocks in Diyala province in eastern Iraq, kidnapping and killing Iraqi government officials and engaging in shootouts with troops, military officials said. And they have expanded attacks in Kirkuk province, taking advantage of the withdrawal of Kurdish peshmerga forces from that area.  Mr Markusen said ISIS attacks in Iraq were more frequent this year than in 2016, up to 75 a month versus 60.  And though thousands of its fighters were killed or captured last year, the group still has 20,000 to 30,000 in Iraq and Syria, he said. That is about the number that the CIA estimated in 2014, when ISIS was at its peak.  An ISIS member, who goes by the name of Yehya, claimed after being reached by WhatsApp in Syria not to be discouraged by the setbacks. ""It's a war of attrition,"" he said. ""When the coalition stops the airstrikes, we will return immediately.""  US officials say the final push against ISIS is so difficult because the fighters have nothing left to lose and no other refuge.  Although the US military estimated that ISIS has only about 2,000 to 2,500 fighters in the Hajin area, Maj-Gen Roberson said they had plenty of time to build elaborate defences, including tunnels and booby-traps.

The checkpoints went away.  Fifteen years after it was sealed off, the heavily fortified neighbourhood in the heart of Baghdad was opened to the public on Monday (Dec 10).  The neighbourhood, known as the Green Zone, had been cordoned off by the US military in 2003 to protect it from bombings during the war.  The 10-sq-km patch of land contained Saddam Hussein's palaces, which later housed the headquarters of the US occupation authorities and military, and the Parliament building, the seat of the new Iraqi government.  But its history and isolation made it a potent symbol first of the US occupation and later of the alienation felt by many Iraqis toward their own government, and Iraqi leaders have been promising to reopen it since the US military withdrew in 2011.  The reopening came on the anniversary of Iraq's recapture of its northern city, Mosul, from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and officials said it would be a trial opening over the coming two weeks.  Traffic was allowed on main thoroughfares but many side roads, where officials live and work, remained closed, and government buildings like the Parliament and Saddam's old Republican Palace remained under heavy guard.  It was the second time in three years that Iraqi officials declared the Green Zone reopened, and there was no guarantee this reopening would last either.  The government reopened it in 2015 for only a few days before closing it again after strong opposition from US officials, whose embassy and military headquarters were inside.  This time, the government has promised the reopening will be permanent.  Last month the government began taking down towering concrete blast walls that surrounded the area, and blocked off many official buildings, former palaces, embassies and villas inside. The reopening had been scheduled for Nov 25 but was postponed.  The reasons were not clear, but it was widely believed the US government and military had opposed the reopening.  A spokesman for the US military in Baghdad, Colonel Sean J. Ryan, said reports that the United States opposed reopening the Green Zone were incorrect and there was no immediate risk to US personnel in the Green Zone.  ""It's a temporary, let's-see-how-it-goes situation right now,"" he said. ""We're here at the invitation of the government of Iraq, and they're a sovereign nation. If that's a decision they want to take, they can. But we're always pretty vigilant with security.""  There has been no change to the heavy fortifications around the US Embassy, which lies on the southern edge of the area, but Monday, US soldiers were seen standing beside now-idle Green Zone checkpoints where no one previously could enter without biometric badges and vehicle passes.  The area was heavily protected during Saddam's regime because of the palaces and residences for himself and family members, but it was not blocked off, since two of the capital's busiest thoroughfares, Haifa Street and 14th of July Boulevard, traversed it.  Although the palaces were heavily bombed during the US invasion, they were chosen to house the US government's occupation administration, headquarters and later the embassy.  As the resistance to the US presence took the form of more and more deadly bombings, many of them by suicide bombers, the entire area was sealed off to the public, subjecting many Iraqis to long and often impossible waits to obtain basic government services.  Other embassies and international agencies moved into the relative protection of the Green Zone, which US officials tried unsuccessfully to rename the ""International Zone"" beginning in late 2003.  It was a doomed rebranding as the Green Zone became enshrined in books, articles and at least one feature movie, ""Green Zone"" with Matt Damon.  Its towering blast walls, many more than 20 feet high and yards thick, became emblematic of an era in which extremists deployed massive bombs, often driven or carried by suicide attackers, which defeated normal protections such as armored cars and roadblocks.  As much as it was fortified and blocked off, the Green Zone remained a target.  In 2004, two suicide bombers managed to infiltrate the zone, killing dozens of Americans and others at a cafe and a souvenir market.  Three years later, the Parliament was bombed, killing one legislator. For a period in 2008, the zone sustained rocket attacks almost daily by followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, firing from the Sadr City neighbourhood across the Tigris River.  Rockets struck the Rashid Hotel there when Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz visited in 2003, killing a US soldier and wounding 17 others.  In 2016, anti-corruption protesters broke into the Green Zone, sacking the Parliament building and bringing the government to a standstill.  A statement from the acting Cabinet secretary, Mahdi Muhsin al-Alaq, said the zone would reopen gradually beginning on Monday and continuing for two weeks.  ""During this period there will be an evaluation of the experience and then expansion to insure the convenience of all citizens,"" he said.  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi made a televised address to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the Islamic State in Mosul, but he did not address the reopening of the Green Zone.  ""Iraq reclaimed its lands, and the people reclaimed their will, and the citizens reclaimed their dignity, and all of us said no to terrorism and no to extremism and no to despotism, and we said yes to Iraq and yes to civilization and yes to citizenship,"" he said.  Monday was declared a national holiday, Victory Day, and a moment of silence was observed at noon.  The US Embassy did not comment on the Green Zone reopening except to warn, in an official security alert, that ""residents of Baghdad should anticipate fireworks and celebratory gunfire throughout the city, to include the International Zone"".  ""Remain indoors, sheltered from falling projectiles,"" it said.  Despite the celebration, the Islamic State still holds a small pocket of territory on the Syria-Iraq border, carries out up to 75 attacks a month throughout Iraq, and is operating underground in many parts of the country.  Attacks in Baghdad have become relatively infrequent, however, and the death toll, while still worrisome, has declined. After several months of relative calm, three bombings in October and November killed four people.  The most immediate impact of Monday's opening would be to ease Baghdad's chronic traffic jams, as Haifa Street and 14th of July Boulevard were major east-west and north-south arteries for the city of 8 million people.  A taxi driver, Muhammad Khalid, 28, who drove through the zone Monday said he was pleased at the improved traffic flow but otherwise disappointed. ""I thought all of the Green Zone would be opened, not just parts of it,"" he said. ""I think it was just to show it to the media."" Sayyid Ali Muhammad, a businessman, also visited. Although he was 32, he said, ""I am seeing the Green Zone for the first time in my life. How is it possible, I'm standing here? Standing at the square where Saddam used to stand and salute people.""  Now that the US-era blast walls are down, many visitors also want to do away with the US name.  ""I hated the name Green Zone,"" said Mahdi al-Karkhi, head of Iraq's soccer federation.  Until the neighbourhood regains its original name, he said, the reopening will never be complete. ""They should call it Al Shawka again, and soon, inshallah."" F",en,terrorattack,,

Police officers secure a street and the surrounding area after a shooting in Strasbourg, France, December 11, 2018. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler  Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the shooter had evaded a police dragnet and was on the run, raising concerns of a follow-up attack.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The government has raised its security threat to the highest level and is bolstering border controls,Ã¢â‚¬Â Castaner told a late-night news conference. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will also reinforce security at all Christmas markets to prevent copycat attacks.Ã¢â‚¬Â  With France still on high alert after a wave of attacks commissioned or inspired by Islamic State militants since early 2015, the counter-terrorism prosecutor opened an investigation.  Police identified the suspect as Strasbourg-born Cherif Chekatt, 29, who was known to the intelligence services as a potential security risk.  Castaner said the gunman exchanged shots with security forces twice as he escaped. His whereabouts now were unknown, and elite commandos and helicopters were involved in the manhunt.  The Paris prosecutor said the motive for the attack was not known. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but the U.S.-based Site intelligence group, which monitors jihadist websites, said Islamic State supporters were celebrating.  The attack began at about 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) as stallholders prepared to close down and restaurants filled in the city, which sits across the Rhine River from Germany. Bystanders were swiftly ushered into nearby shops.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There was confusion initially but they locked the front doors pretty soon after the gunshots,Ã¢â‚¬Â said U.S. citizen Elizabeth Osterwisch, who was sheltering on the top floor of the Galeries Lafayette department store. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They moved us several times, eventually settling on the place with the most protection.Ã¢â‚¬Â  European Parliament lawmaker Emmanuel Maurel said he had heard the shots.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“From my hotel window I saw passersby dragging someone who was injured and onlookers panicking,Ã¢â‚¬Â he tweeted. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soldiers and police have cordoned off the area. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being told to stay in the hotel.Ã¢â‚¬Â  CHRISTMAS MARKET SECURITY  The European Parliament, which is sitting in Strasbourg this week, was put into lockdown.  On the opposite side of the Rhine river German police also tightened border controls, officials said.  The Strasbourg prefecture said the gunman was on an intelligence services watchlist.  Sources familiar with the police operation said the suspectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home had been raided earlier in the day in connection with a robbery during the summer, but he was not found there.  A Reuters reporter was among 30 to 40 people being held in the basement of a supermarket for their own safety, waiting for police to clear the area. Lights were switched off and bottles of water handed out.  Security was tight this year for the Christmas market, which is popular with visitors to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old quarter, with its Gothic cathedral and half-timbered houses.  Unauthorised vehicles were excluded from surrounding streets during opening hours and checkpoints were set up on bridges and access points to search pedestriansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bags.  President Emmanuel Macron was being updated on events, an Elysee Palace official said. Castaner was on his way to Strasbourg.  ATTACK FEARS  Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Commission, the EU executive body, tweeted: Ã¢â‚¬Å“My thoughts are with the victims of the Strasbourg shooting, which I condemn with the utmost firmness. Strasbourg is an excellent symbol of peace and European Democracy. Values that we will always defend.Ã¢â‚¬Â  British Prime Minister Theresa May said she was Ã¢â‚¬Å“shocked and saddened.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Some 26,000 individuals suspected of posing a security risk to France are on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“S FileÃ¢â‚¬Â watchlist, of whom about 10,000 are believed to have been radicalised, sometimes in fundamentalist Salafist Muslim mosques, online or abroad.  European security agencies have feared for some time that Islamist militants who left Europe to fight for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq would return after the jihadist groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defeat, with the skills and motivation to carry out attacks at home.  Secular France has been grappling with how to respond to both homegrown jihadists and foreign militants following attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and beyond since 2015.  Slideshow (19 Images)  In 2016, a truck ploughed into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing more than 80 people. In November 2015, coordinated Islamist militant attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris claimed about 130 lives. There have also been attacks in Paris on a policeman on the Champs-Elysees avenue, the offices of satirical weekly publication Charlie Hebdo and a kosher store.  Almost exactly two years ago, a Tunisian Islamist rammed a hijacked truck into a Christmas market in central Berlin, killing 11 people as well as the driver.

2372248,channelnewsasia,None,Turkey to launch operation against US-backed Kurds in Syria 'in a few days',https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/turkey-to-launch-operation-against-us-backed-kurds-in-syria--in-a-few-days--11026304,,13/12/2018 6:22,"ISTANBUL: Turkey will launch a new military operation in northern Syria within days, targeting Kurdish militia fighters who are supported by U.S. troops east of the Euphrates river, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday.  Ankara and Washington have long been at odds over Syria, where the United States has backed the YPG Kurdish militia in the fight against Islamic State insurgents.  Advertisement  Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist organisation and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against the state in southeastern Turkey for 34 years.  Turkey has already intervened to sweep YPG fighters from territory west of the Euphrates in military campaigns over the past two years, but up until now, it had not gone east of the river - partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces.  But Erdogan's patience with Washington over Syria - specifically a deal to clear the YPG from the town of Manbij, just west of the Euphrates - seems to have worn thin.  ""We will start the operation to clear the east of the Euphrates from separatist terrorists in a few days. Our target is never U.S. soldiers,"" Erdogan said at a speech at a defence industry summit in Ankara.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""This step will allow for the path to a political solution to be opened and for healthier cooperation.""  Turkey has repeatedly voiced frustration about what it says are delays in the implementation of the Manbij deal, saying last month that the agreement should be fully carried out by the end of this year.  Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols near Manbij last month, but that cooperation has also been complicated as Turkey has shelled Kurdish fighters to the east of the Euphrates.  A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Erdogan's comments had created concern in the Pentagon that the fight against Islamic State militants could be affected.  The official said there was concern that a Turkish operation could distract Kurdish YPG fighters away from the middle Euphrates River Valley.  In March, another Turkish offensive against the YPG affected the fight against Islamic State and led to an ""operational pause"" in eastern Syria.  OBSERVATION POSTS  The Pentagon says it has about 2,000 troops in Syria.  Last month the United States said would establish observation posts on the border between Kurdish-held northern Syria and Turkey after Turkish cross-border shelling killed four Kurdish fighters.  The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the Turkish attacks had led to a temporary halt in the U.S.-backed campaign the SDF are waging against Islamic State near the Syria-Iraq border.  Three observation posts have now been set up, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday. The official said the positions were clearly marked and any force attacking them ""would definitely know they are attacking the United States"".  Erdogan's announcement came after Turkish officials held talks in Ankara this week with the U.S. special representative for Syria, Jim Jeffrey. An SDF military source said Jeffrey met the SDF leadership in northern Syria on Wednesday.  Erdogan said Turkey was the victim of a ""stalling tactic"" over Manbij and Islamic State no longer posed a threat in Syria.  ""Now, it's time to realise our decision to disperse the circles of terror east of the Euphrates. The fact that we have deep differences in perception with the United States is no secret,"" he said.  ""A stalling tactic has been used in Manbij and is still being used... There is no threat named Daesh in Syria anymore. This is a fairytale,"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the militant group.  The YPG still controls a large swathe of northeast Syria, on Turkey's southern border. Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the PKK. More than 40,000 people, mostly Kurds, have died in the PKK's conflict with Ankara. Turkish authorities fear the conflict could be stoked by the YPG presence across the border.

A photo of Cherif Chekatt, 29, who was born in Strasbourg, was distributed publicly Wednesday evening.  The poster warns: ""Dangerous individual, above all do not intervene."" It asks anyone with information that could help locate him to contact authorities.  Chekatt has been on the run since allegedly spraying gunfire at the city's famous Christmas market on Tuesday night, killing two and leaving one person brain-dead. A dozen others were injured.  Hundreds of police and soldiers were combing Strasbourg in a search of him, blocking bridges that cross the border into Germany. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced a strengthening of security forces to secure Christmas markets.  ____  7:55 p.m.  The pope has expressed strong condemnation of the attack on the Christmas market in Strasbourg, France, that killed two, left one person brain dead and injured 12 others.  Pope Francis said in a telegram to the archbishop of Strasbourg, Monsignor Luc Ravel, on Wednesday that he learned of the attack ""with sadness and concern,"" and expressed his compassion to all those affected by the attack.  Francis also offered ""a special thought"" to the professionals and volunteers who responded to the wounded.  The pope also sent a separate telegram to the head of the Brazilian archdiocese of Campinas, where a man opened fire in a cathedral on Tuesday, killing four people.

The minister was addressing parliamentarians on Wednesday, a day after the suspect, identified as Cherif Chekatt, 29, sprayed gunfire around the Christmas market in the eastern city, killing two, leaving a third person brain dead and injuring 12 others.  Chekatt was still on the run, with hundreds of police and soldiers seeking him in a massive manhunt.  Authorities said earlier that Chekatt had more than two dozen convictions, mostly in France but also in Switzerland and Germany. They said that Chekatt had been flagged for extremism and under watch.  ___  5:10 p.m.  A minute's silence will be held at all soccer stadiums in the French first and second division this weekend following Tuesday night's deadly Christmas market attack in Strasbourg.  Authorities say two people were killed, one left brain dead and 12 others injured in the shooting rampage.  Three matches in the first division have been postponed this weekend at the request of authorities, with police resources stretched.  ____  4:30 p.m.  A young Italian radio journalist who was in Strasbourg to cover a session of the European Parliament is in critical condition after being shot in the Christmas market attack.  The news agency ANSA said Wednesday that 28-year-old Antonio Megalizzi was struck by a bullet at the base of his cranium. ANSA says his parents, sister and girlfriend have traveled to France to join him.  Megalizzi is a journalist with the Europhonica radio consortium linked to universities. Italian daily La Repubblica reports that he traveled Strasbourg on Sunday to follow the European Parliamentary session. Megalizzi is from the northern city of Trento, and is working on a masters focusing on European institutions.  Europhonica has posted a Facebook message saying it cannot confirm any news about his health.  ____  4:15 p.m.  French lawmakers have held a minute's silence at the National Assembly for victims and their families following Tuesday night's deadly Christmas market attack in Strasbourg.  Interior minister Christophe Castaner has paid tribute to three people who tried to stop the gunman in streets near the famous market, including a woman who suffered stab wounds.  He said Wednesday their actions highlighted ""our compatriots' ability to be heroic."" Lawmakers from all parties applauded his comments.  Socialist and far-left lawmakers have asked to postpone a no-confidence vote against the government linked to its handling of the Yellow Vest protests, saying they want to preserve the nation's unity at difficult times. The vote had been scheduled for Thursday  ____  3:55 p.m.  A Thai Foreign Ministry spokeswoman says the country's embassy in Paris has confirmed that a Thai national, 45-year-old Anupong Suebsamarn, was killed in a deadly Christmas market shooting in the French city of Strasbourg.  Anupong had been traveling with his wife.  The English-language website of the newspapaer Khao Sod said Anupong was the owner of a noodle factory in Chachoengsao province, east of Bangkok, and also sold clothes in the Thai capital's garment district.  It quoted his uncle as saying the couple had originally planned to be in Paris, but the yellow vest protests there caused them to change plans and go to Strasbourg instead.  Spokeswoman Busadee Santipitaks said Thai officials had asked French authorities and members of the Thai community in Strasbourg to help Anupong's widow, and Thai consular officials were traveling there Wednesday to provide further assistance.  ___  3:45 p.m.  A judicial official says that the father and two brothers of the man suspected of attacking the Strasbourg Christmas market are among four people in custody in the investigation.  The suspected gunman himself, identified by police union officials as 29-year-old Cherif Cherkatt, is at large.  He was on a police watch list for radicalism before Tuesday's attack. The judicial official says that other members of Cherkatt's family are also known for radical views.  The official was not authorized to be publicly named speaking about an ongoing investigation.  Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told parliament Wednesday that 720 security officers are mobilized to search for the gunman.  Authorities say two people were killed, one left brain dead and 12 others injured in the shooting rampage.  Ã¢â‚¬â€ By Angela Charlton  ___  1:30 p.m.  The German government says it has stepped up controls on the country's border with France following Tuesday night's attack in Strasbourg, but sees no change to the threat level in Germany.  Interior Ministry spokeswoman Eleonore Petermann said there's no reason to stay away from Christmas markets in Germany. A Christmas market in Berlin was targeted in a deadly attack two years ago.  Petermann and Germany's justice ministry said that German authorities had no information on links between the suspected attacker, who previously spent prison time in Germany for robbery, and Islamic extremists.  The suspect, who killed at least two and injured about a dozen others Tuesday, was convicted in Germany in 2016 and reportedly deported to France in 2017. Petermann said, however, that his freedom of movement within the European Union had been removed.  ___  1:20 p.m.  French President Emmanuel Macron is holding an emergency security meeting at the presidential palace in Paris following Tuesday's attack in the eastern city of Strasbourg that killed at least two and injured about a dozen others.  The defense council is taking place in the presence of top military officials and government members, including the prime minister, interior, defense and foreign affairs ministers.  They will discuss the progress of the investigation and other security measures as the government raised the alert level nationwide and sent police reinforcements to Strasbourg in a manhunt for the suspect.  Interior minister Christophe Castaner was back Wednesday in Paris after travelling to Strasbourg overnight to supervise police operations.  ___  1:10 p.m.  Neighbors of the man suspected of attacking Strasbourg's Christmas market have described him as destabilized by his time in prison.  ""You can just tell,"" said one of the young men from the apartment block where suspected gunman Cherif Chekatt lived, lightly touching the side of his head. They feared being publicly named because the gunman is still being hunted by police.  A neighbor, who also asked not to be named, said he was rarely home. She said she last saw him Monday from her window, which looks out on a common hallway, and he was with another man.  The lock of the door is broken at the suspect's apartment. Police were guarding the building where the gunman was believed to have lived, in an outer neighborhood of Strasbourg.  Hundreds of police and soldiers are hunting for Chekatt, 29, who opened fire near Strasbourg's Christmas market Tuesday, killing two and leaving one brain dead.  ___  12:50 p.m.  A French prosecutor says witnesses heard the suspected gunman shout ""God is great"" in Arabic during the shooting spree in Strasbourg that killed two people and left another brain dead.  Prosecutor Remy Heitz said the suspected gunman was shot in the arm during an exchange of fire with French soldiers in the city center and then took a taxi to another part of the city during the rampage on Tuesday night.  He said the man was armed with a handgun and a knife, using them to attack his victims. He also left 12 people injured.  Previously, French authorities had said the gunman killed three people. But Heitz said two people were confirmed dead while the third was brain dead.  He also said police found a grenade, a rifle and four knives during a search Tuesday morning of the 29-year-old's house. They had wanted to take him into custody as in an investigation for suspected murder.  ___  11:25 a.m.  Two police officials have identified the suspected Strasbourg gunman as 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt.  One police source said Chekatt's criminal record mentions 25 judicial cases, including several serious cases of robbery.  The official said his apartment was searched by police on Tuesday morning Ã¢â‚¬â€ hours before the shooting Ã¢â‚¬â€ in an investigation for attempted murder. He was not at home at the time.  The two officials spoke anonymously because they were not allowed to speak publicly on an ongoing investigation.  The suspect was still on the run on Wednesday after he fired gunshots near the famous Christmas market of Strasbourg, killing three and wounding at least 13.  Ã¢â‚¬â€ By Sylvie Corbet  ___  11:10 a.m.  The European Parliament is planning a minute of silence at noon to remember the victims of the Strasbourg shooting, which happened only a few kilometers (miles) from the legislature.  European Parliament Antonio Tajani called the shooting ""a criminal attack against peace, against democracy, against our model of life.""  He said that even as the Parliament went into a lockdown late Tuesday, legislators continued their work until midnight. ""We have to go forward and not change our ways,"" Tajani said.  ___  10:50 a.m.  The suspected Strasbourg gunman was convicted of robbery in Germany in 2016 and sentenced to two years and three months in prison for breaking into a dental practice and a pharmacy.  The verdict from a district court in Singen, obtained by The Associated Press, says he was also sentenced to prison in France in 2008 and in Basel, Switzerland in 2013 for various robberies. News agency dpa reported that he was deported to France in 2017.  According to the verdict, the suspected attacker grew up with six siblings in Strasbourg, worked for local authorities after leaving school and had been unemployed since 2011. He said he had been traveling a lot and had already spent four years in prison. The German robberies took place in Mainz, near Frankfurt, in 2012 and in Engen, near the Swiss border, in 2016.  ___  8:35 a.m.  A senior French government official says that five people have been detained as police hunt for the man who attacked the Strasbourg Christmas market, but the gunman remains at large.  Laurent Nunez, secretary of state for the interior ministry, said Wednesday on France-Inter radio that the attacker could have fled to neighboring Germany.  He said that three people were killed and 13 injured, eight of them seriously. He denied reports of a police intervention at the city's famed cathedral but said the search for the attacker is constantly evolving.  Nunez said the assailant had been identified as a suspected extremist during his past stays in prison but said the motive for the attack remains unclear. A terrorism investigation was opened.  ___  8 a.m.  France is hunting for a suspected extremist who sprayed gunfire near the famous Christmas market in the eastern city of Strasbourg, killing three and wounding at least 11.  The government raised the security alert level and sent police reinforcements to Strasbourg where some 250 security forces are searching for the assailant.  The attacker is a 29-year-old with a police record in France and neighboring Germany who had been flagged for extremism. A terrorism investigation was opened.  While authorities urged people in the area to stay inside, Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries told BFM television Wednesday that ""life must go on"" so that the city doesn't cede to a ""terrorist who is trying to disrupt our way of life.""  Strasbourg is considered one of Europe's capitals. It's home to the European Parliament.",en,terrorattack,559,['France']

It says: ""There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.""  At most, it notes that ""Mexican government officials observed on social media an increase in terrorist group sympathizers in its territory over the previous year.""  That report dwells much more on the northern neighbor, home to ""Canada-based violent extremists inspired by terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaida and their affiliates and adherents."" Moreover, Canada has experienced episodes of terrorism at the hands of sympathizers of those organizations. And, the report says, Canada faces a ""significant challenge in prosecuting individuals who have traveled abroad to engage in terrorism, due to the difficulty in proving association with terrorist organizations or having committed specific terrorist acts.""  Yet the State Department credits both Canada and Mexico with cooperating with the U.S. on terrorism and strengthening protections. And no evidence has emerged that terrorists are pouring in from Canada, either.  ___  In January, a joint report by the Homeland Security and Justice departments states that Homeland Security had 2,554 ""encounters"" worldwide with people on a terrorist watch list who were trying to travel to the U.S. That breaks down to an average of seven per day, and is the seed of what becomes Trump's claim about the ""very serious"" 10.  The vast majority were trying to come by air, 2,170, with 335 by land and the rest by sea. Nothing ties them specifically to Mexico.  Vice President Mike Pence misrepresents the finding the next month, attributing all of those encounters to the Mexico border: ""I learned yesterday at the Hidalgo border center that along the southern border of the United States, we actually still apprehend 1,100 individuals a day, who are attempting to enter this country illegally, including seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists.""  There's more wrong with his statement than that.  The people encountered by Homeland Security were denied entry to the U.S., not apprehended en masse as Pence says. In some cases law enforcement authorities were notified for ""appropriate action,"" says the report, giving no detail on arrests or any charges.  As well, it may be a stretch to characterize everyone on the watch list as a ""known or suspected"" terrorist. The list is an initial trip-wire identifying people who, rightly or wrongly, raise some concern. The standard for placing someone on the list is reasonable suspicion, a lower bar than the probable cause needed to arrest someone for an alleged crime.  ___  In June, the average of seven per day grows to 10, without new statistics being announced. ""On average, my department now blocks 10 known or suspected terrorists a day from traveling to or attempting to enter the United States,"" says Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.  ___  In September, the next annual State Department terrorism report is released, finding ""no credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States. The U.S. southern border remains vulnerable to potential terrorist transit, although terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the United States."" More episodes of terrorism are noted in Canada.  Late in the month, with the Trump administration signaling concern about Central American migrants making their way north, and Trump continually prodding for money to build his wall, the statistic is brought out, and misshapen, again.  ""In the last fiscal year, we apprehended more than 10 terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as other than Mexico,"" Pence says. ""That means from the Middle East region.""  The average of 10 a day has grown again, to more than 10. And Pence again says this all happened at the Mexico border.  This time, when Pence's office is asked about the claim, his people acknowledge the error. Later the same day, the vice president correctly attributes the number to all points of entry into the U.S.  Trump, though, continues to drum up fear about Muslim extremism coming via Mexico and migrants, tweeting Oct. 22: ""Sadly, it looks like Mexico's Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy. Must change laws!""  The next day he tells reporters in the Oval Office: ""I spoke with Border Patrol this morning. ... They say that over the course of the year, over the course of many years, they have intercepted good and bad people, including people from the Middle East.""  Yet he acknowledges, ""There's no proof of anything.""  ___  This month, Trump's proposed southern wall becomes the prickly centerpiece of a budget struggle that threatens to idle parts of the government starting Dec. 21 barring a deal.  In his contentious public meeting with the Democratic leaders, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump makes a case for varied menaces from Mexico, describing those trying to get into the U.S. as carriers of disease Ã¢â‚¬â€ an assertion he did not support Ã¢â‚¬â€ and criminals.  He renders the average of 10 watch-list travelers per day encountered by Homeland Security last year as ""10 terrorists,"" never mind suspects, recently ""caught"" trying to get in.  The White House's support for that assertion? The same report that got the ball weirdly rolling almost a year ago: a daily average of encounters in 2017, not 10 terrorists in the flesh, very serious or not.  ___  Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Colleen Long contributed to this report.",en,terrorattack,,

The Turkish military said on Friday it killed eight Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, prompting Iraqi authorities to summon the Turkish ambassador in Baghdad.  Advertisement  Turkey regularly hits PKK bases across its southern border, saying the militants use the remote and mountainous northern Iraqi region as a base for deadly attacks inside Turkey, where the outlawed group has waged an insurgency since the 1980s.  President Tayyip Erdogan threatened to launch a ground offensive in northern Iraq earlier this year. This week he also announced an imminent operation against a Kurdish militia in neighbouring Syria.  The U.S.-backed YPG militia, which has been fighting Islamic State in Syria, controls Syria's northeastern border with Turkey. Ankara says it is an extension of the PKK and poses a direct threat to Turkey.  ""The activities of the PKK terrorist organisation in the territory of Iraq and Syria have become a national security issue for Turkey,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said.

""These operations in the fight against terrorism will continue as long as terror organisations nest on Iraqi soil and as long as TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security needs require it to,"" Aksoy said.  The PKK is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.

Boko Haram fighters in several trucks stormed Maiborti village, 5km outside Maiduguri, firing indiscriminately and setting fire to homes, they said.  A military officer who did not want to be identified said troops and fighter jets were deployed to the village and scrambled to push out the militants after Ã¢â‚¬Å“fierce battleÃ¢â‚¬Â.  It was not clear if there were casualties in the attack which once again highlighted the fragile security situation in the restive region.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They (Boko Haram) came around 5:30pm and started firing in the village which made us abandon our homes and flee to Maiduguri,Ã¢â‚¬Â Maiborti resident Abacha Kaka told AFP.  Militia leader Babakura Kolo said the jihadists were later forced out of the village by troops with aerial support.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unfortunately, the terrorists succeeded in setting fire to the village and burning it down completely,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  Boko Haram has in recent months launched attacks in a bid to capture Maiduguri, the birthplace of its founder Mohammed Yusuf.  Last month, the jihadists attacked Jimmi village just outside the city, killing one person and stealing hundreds of livestock.  In April, scores of Boko Haram fighters launched a gun and suicide attack on Jiddari-Polo, outside the city.  The Islamist group has attacked at least 20 military bases in recent weeks, killing dozens of soldiers and carting away weapons.  Boko HaramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nine-year rebellion has killed at least 27,000 and forced more than two million people to flee their homes.    ",en,terrorattack,,

Four air strikes on Saturday killed 32 militants and a further two on Sunday killed 28, it said in a statement.  These were the deadliest air attacks in Somalia since November 2017 when the US said it had killed 100 militants.  Somalia has seen a sharp increase in the number of air strikes and casualties since President Donald Trump took office in the US in January 2017.  A tally by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism reveals that at least 400 people have been killed in air strikes since the beginning of 2017, far more than the previous 10 years combined.  The latest strikes bring to at least 40 the number carried out in Somalia so far this year, compared with 35 recorded in 2017.  The US has a huge military base in neighbouring Djibouti, from where it launches attacks on the militants.  Mr Trump gave the US military greater authority in March 2017 to attack militants in Somalia.  Traditionally, US presidents have been wary of intervening in Somalia since 18 special forces soldiers died fighting militias in the capital Mogadishu in 1993, a battle dramatised in the film Black Hawk Down.  'Terrorist safe haven'  No civilians were killed in the latest air strikes, which were carried out in co-ordination with the Somali government, the US military said.  ""Alongside our Somali and international partners, we are committed to preventing al-Shabab from taking advantage of safe havens from which they can build capacity and attack the people of Somalia,"" the US Africa Command said.  Al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaeda, has not yet commented on the latest strikes.  Somalia-based security think tank the Hiraal Institute said in a report published in November that al-Shabab had been forced to change tactics following the upsurge in air strikes.  The institute said the group was now conducting fewer mass attacks on military bases, but attacks on government offices and businesses which refused to pay it taxes had increased markedly.  The US state department, in its most recent report on terrorism, described Somalia as a ""terrorist safe haven"" and said al-Shabab remained a threat, despite suffering setbacks.  The group retained control over large parts of the country, and the ability to carry out high-profile attacks using suicide bombers, explosive devices, mortars and small arms, the report added.",en,terrorattack,567,"['Somalia', 'Air', 'Air', 'US']"
2403438,foxnews,None,"Children as young as 10 fight, kill and die in Yemen's war",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/BHzCfkuFSAo/children-as-young-as-10-fight-kill-and-die-in-yemens-war,,19/12/2018 14:45,"next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  The number etched on the bracelet around Mohammed's wrist gave the 13-year-old soldier comfort as missiles fired from enemy warplanes shook the earth beneath him.  For two years Mohammed fought with Yemen's Houthi rebels against a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United States. He says he tortured and killed people and didn't care whether he lived or died.  But if he died, the bracelet would guarantee his body made it home.  ""When I become a martyr, they enter my number in the computer, retrieve my picture and my name, then print them with the name 'Martyr' underneath,"" Mohammed said. It would be pasted to the lid of his coffin for return to his family.  Mohammed was among 18 former child soldiers interviewed by The Associated Press who described the Houthis' unrelenting efficiency when it comes to the recruitment, deployment and even battlefield deaths of boys as young as 10.  While both sides in the four-year civil war have sent children into combat in violation of international human rights conventions, the Houthis are believed to have recruited many more than the coalition Ã¢â‚¬â€ often forcibly.  The Houthis have inducted 18,000 child soldiers into their rebel army since the beginning of the war in 2014, a senior Houthi military official acknowledged to the AP. He spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information.  That figure is higher than any number previously reported. The United Nations was able to verify 2,721 children recruited to fight for all sides in the conflict, the large majority for the Houthis, but officials say that count is likely low, because many families will not speak about the issue out of fear of reprisals from Houthi militiamen.  The Houthis say officially that they don't recruit children and send away those who try to enlist.  Some of the children told the AP they joined the rebels willingly, mainly because of promises of money or the chance to carry a weapon. But others described being forced into the service of the Houthis Ã¢â‚¬â€ abducted from schools or homes or coerced into joining in exchange for a family member's release from detention.  Many can be seen manning checkpoints along main roads across northern and western Yemen, AK-47s dangling from their narrow shoulders. Others are sent to the front lines as foot soldiers.  A 13-year-old named Riyadh said half of the fighters he served with on the front lines in Yemen's mountainous Sirwah district were children. Rebel officers ordered them to push forward during battles, even as coalition jets zoomed overhead, he said.  He said he pleaded with his commander to let the young fighters take cover during airstrikes: ""Sir, the planes are bombing.""  The reply, he said, was always: ""Followers of God, you must attack!""  An unknown number of child soldiers have been sent home in coffins.  More than 6,000 children have died or been maimed in Yemen since the beginning of the war, UNICEF reported in October. But the U.N. agency has not been able to determine how many of those minors were combatants and the Houthi-run Defense Ministry does not release its records for casualties.  A former teacher from the city of Dhamar said that at least 14 pupils from his school were recruited and then died in battle. Their pictures were placed on empty classroom seats in 2016 during the Week of the Martyr, which the Houthis celebrate each year in February. Most of them were fifth and sixth graders, he said. An education official from Dhamar confirmed his account. The two spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of retribution.  The teacher said some of the dead children's parents were Houthi leaders who willingly sent their sons to the front lines. ""It's painful because this is a child and they are all my children because I was their teacher,"" he said. ""They were taken from the school and returned in coffins.""  The Houthis and the coalition forces began peace talks in Sweden two weeks ago, but an end to the war appears far off. Many worry about what will become of the children who fought in the Middle East's poorest country once a peace treaty is signed.  Naguib al-Saadi, a Yemeni human rights activist who founded a Saudi-funded counseling center in Marib for child warriors, said ""the real problem with Houthi recruitment of the children will be felt in 10 years Ã¢â‚¬â€ when a generation that has been brainwashed with hatred and enmity toward the West comes of age.""  ___  'FIREWOOD FOR THIS WAR'  The war began after Houthi rebels swept down from the northern highlands in late 2014, seizing the capital, Sanaa, and then pushing south. Yemen's internationally recognized government sought help from the Saudis and other oil-rich neighbors, which formed the military coalition opposing the Houthis.  The result has been a proxy war as much as a civil war, with forces backed by the Saudis fighting the Houthis, a Zaidi-Shiite religious and political group with ties to Iran.  A report released in August by a U.N. expert panel said both sides are using child soldiers. The panel said it had information that coalition forces had targeted ""particularly vulnerable children"" living in displacement camps and ""offered significant payments for child recruits."" The report said coalition units ""frequently used children in support roles, although they have also been used in combat on the front lines.""  The panel noted that nearly two-thirds of the child soldiers identified by the U.N. in 2017 were deployed by the Houthis and their allies.  The Houthis constantly recruit new fighters because their ranks are smaller and thinned by battlefield losses. The well-funded and well-equipped coalition units have nearly 140,000 troops in the field, experts who study the war say. The Houthi military official told the AP that rebel forces have 60,000 fighters on the front lines. Outside experts estimate the Houthis' troop strength at between 15,000 and 50,000.  Top Houthi officials heap praise on young soldiers who have died in a conflict they describe as a sacred war against America, Israel and other outside powers they believe are trying to take over the country.  Under the Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry, the rebels have pursued what they call a ""national voluntary recruitment campaign.""  Brig. Gen. Yahia Sarie, a spokesman for the Houthis' armed forces, told the AP ""there is no general policy to use the children in the battles,"" but he acknowledged that some young people do volunteer to join the fight.  ""It's personal initiative,"" the general said. ""Some of the children are motivated by the desire to take revenge, thinking it's better to take action and fight with honor instead of getting killed inside our homes."" When they try to join, he said, Houthi leaders ""send them back home.""  He dismissed the accounts from the children who spoke to the AP, saying their claims were coalition propaganda.  Children, parents, educators, social workers and other Yemenis interviewed by the AP described an aggressive campaign that targets children Ã¢â‚¬â€ and is not always completely voluntary. Houthi officials use their access to the Civil Registry Authority and other state records to gather data that allows them to narrow down their target list of the neediest families in villages and displacement camps Ã¢â‚¬â€ the ones most likely to accept offers of cash in return for recruits.  In Sanaa, the Yemeni capital under Houthi control, recruiters go door to door telling parents they must either turn over their sons or pay money for the war effort, according to residents.  The AP interviewed the 18 former child soldiers at displacement camps and a counseling center in the city of Marib, which is controlled by the Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition. They had come to Marib after slipping away from rebel forces or being captured by coalition units.  Because of their ages and because some of them acknowledge committing acts of brutality, the AP is only using their first names. Some children gave themselves a nom du guerre after they joined the fighting. One 10-year-old boy, for example, called himself Abu Nasr, Arabic for ""Father of Victory.""  A 13-year-old boy named Saleh told the AP that Houthi militiamen stormed his family's home in the northern district of Bani Matar on a Saturday morning and demanded he and his father come with them to the front lines. He said his father told them, ""Not me and my son"" and then tried to pull his rifle on them. ""They dragged him away,"" the boy recalled. ""I heard the bullets, then my father collapsing dead.""  Saleh said the militiamen took him with them and forced him to do sentry duty at a checkpoint 12 hours a day.  International relief agencies working on child protection programs in northern Yemen are not allowed to discuss the use of child soldiers, out of fear their agencies will be barred from delivering aid to Houthi-controlled territories, according to four aid workers who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""This is a taboo,"" one said.  ""They don't raise the issue,"" said Abdullah al-Hamadi, a former deputy education minister who defected earlier this year from the Houthi-controlled government in the north.  Al-Hamadi said that the children who are targeted for recruitment are not the sons of important Houthi families or top commanders. Instead, they are usually kids from poor tribes who are being used ""as firewood for this war.""  In villages and small towns, recruiters include teenagers whose brothers or fathers already work for the Houthis. They can be seen hanging around schools, handing out chewing tobacco and trying to persuade the boys to become fighters.  Several residents of Sanaa told the AP that Houthis divide the capital into security blocs, each overseen by a supervisor who must meet rolling quotas for bringing in new recruits. He collects information on the families living in his bloc by knocking on the doors of each house and asking for the number of male members, their names and ages.  ""It looks random from the outside, but in reality it's not,"" a Yemeni journalist who worked in Houthi territory said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the risks of talking about the rebels. ""There are teams with specific missions and clear structure.""  He and his family fled to Marib, a coalition stronghold, because he feared that the rebels would try to recruit his children.  Houthi recruiters assure families their sons won't be assigned to battle zones, but instead will be sent to work behind the lines at roadside checkpoints. Once militiamen get hold of the children, they often instead send them to indoctrination and training camps, and then the front lines, according to two children interviewed by the AP and officials from two child protection groups. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns that the Houthis might retaliate by blocking their groups from working in Yemen.  Children interviewed by the AP said they were targeted by recruiters on soccer pitches, farms and, especially, schools.  A 12-year-old named Kahlan said Houthi militiamen drove him and 10 of his classmates away in a pickup truck, telling them they were being taken to a place where they would get new school bags.  It was a lie.  Instead, still in their school uniforms, they found themselves inside a training camp getting instructions on how to hide from airstrikes.  ___  'KEY FOR HEAVEN'  New recruits are usually taken first to ""culture centers"" for religious courses lasting nearly a month. Instructors read aloud to the children from the lectures of the Houthi movement's founder, Hussein Badr Eddin al-Houthi, the late brother of the current leader, Abdul-Malek al-Houthi.  The lectures, dating back to 2002, are circulated in audio and video and transcribed into booklets known as ""Malazem.""  They are told they are joining a holy war against Jews and Christians and Arab countries that have succumbed to Western influence Ã¢â‚¬â€ and that if the boys die fighting, they will go to heaven. The instructors fuel the recruits' anger with accounts of coalition attacks that have killed civilians, including an airstrike in August that hit a bus full of schoolchildren.  ""When you get out of the culture center, you don't want to go home anymore,"" said Mohammed, the boy who served with the Houthis from ages 13 to 15. ""You want to go to jihad.""  The recruits are then sent to military training camps in the mountains, according to several children who defected from the Houthis. By night, they sleep in tents or huts made of tree branches. By day, they learn how to fire weapons, plant explosives and avoid missiles fired by coalition jets.  From noon to sunset, the young soldiers get a daily share of the green leaves of qat, a mild stimulant that the vast majority of Yemenis chew every day. Coming from poor families, having qat is an incentive for the children, who might not be able to afford it at home.  After less than a month of boot camp, they are sent to war, wearing the bracelets that are supposed to ensure that, if they die, they are returned to their families and honored as martyrs.  The children call the inscription their ""jihadi number."" Critics of the Houthis sardonically call the bracelets the children's ""key for heaven.""  Once in the battle zones, some children said, their weapons and their beliefs made them feel powerful. Others just felt frightened.  Mohammed fought in and around the city of Taiz, the scene of the war's longest running battle.  One day, his comrades captured a coalition fighter and brought him to a bombed-out restaurant for interrogation. Mohammed, 14 at the time, said he fetched an electric generator and hooked it up to the prisoner. He sent electric shocks screaming through the man's body, he said, as his commander questioned the captive about coalition forces' positions.  When the questioning was over, he said, his commander gave this order: ""Get rid of him."" Mohammed said he took a heavy metal tool, heated it in a flame, then swung it, caving in the back of the man's head.  ""He was my master,"" Mohammed recalled. ""If he says kill, I would kill.... I would blow myself up for him.""  Riyadh, the 13-year-old who fought in the Sirwah mountains, said he and his 11-year-old brother once shot and killed two enemy soldiers who had refused to lay down their weapons. But more often, he said, he closed his eyes tightly when he fired his rifle.  ""Honestly, when I am afraid, I don't know where I am shooting Ã¢â‚¬â€ sometimes in the air and sometimes just randomly,"" he said.  The most frightening moment came when his brother disappeared during a firefight.  ""I was crying,"" Riyadh recalled. ""I told the commander that my brother had been martyred.""  He began turning over corpses on the battlefield, searching bloodied faces for his lost brother when he and other fighters came under fire. They fired back. Then, after some yelling back and forth, he realized the shooter was not an enemy fighter but his brother, lost in the fog of battle.  A few weeks later, Riyadh and his brother escaped, paying a truck driver to smuggle them away from the Houthi forces.  Kahlan Ã¢â‚¬â€ the schoolboy who had been lured into combat with the promise of a new book bag Ã¢â‚¬â€ was first assigned to carry boxes of food and ammunition for soldiers. Then he was deployed to fight. He and the other boys had no clothes other than their school uniforms, he said. They were so filthy many sprouted skin rashes.  Coalition aircraft screeched overhead, dropping bombs and firing missiles at Houthi positions. Afterward, trucks rumbled in to collect the dead.  ""The sight of the bodies was scary,"" Kahlan recalled, using his hands to pantomime how corpses were missing heads or limbs or had their intestines oozing out.  He slipped away from the Houthi camp early one morning, running from one village to another. ""I was afraid to look back. I saw trees and rocks and I got more scared because they used to hide behind the trees.""  ___  'LISTENING SESSIONS'  Mohammed, Riyadh and Kahlan all ended up in Marib, at a rehabilitation center for children who served as Houthi soldiers. Since September 2017, nearly 200 boys have come through the center, which was founded by the Wethaq Foundation for Civil Orientation and funded with Saudi money.  Mayoub al-Makhlafi, the center's psychiatrist, said the common symptom among all the former child soldiers is extreme aggression. They suffer anxiety, panic attacks and attention deficits. Some describe being beaten by their own commanders, a staffer at the center said. She said she has also heard reports from children on both sides of the fighting about being sexually abused by officers. She spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of sexual abuse issues.  The center brings the children together for ""listening sessions"" that help them remember their lives before they were sent to war.  On his first day at the center, Mohammed said, he was terrified. He didn't know what they would do to him there. ""But then I saw the teachers and they gave me a room to stay in. I felt good after that.""  His mother lives in Taiz, in an area under Houthi control, so he can't live with her. He has other relatives and moves from one house to another. Sometimes, he said, he sleeps in the street.  He no longer has the bracelet with the serial number that the Houthis gave him as part of their promise that he'd get a martyr's funeral. When he defected, he said, his older brother sent him to be questioned by coalition authorities.  During the interrogation, a security officer took out a pair of scissors and cut the bracelet from Mohammed's wrist.",en,terrorattack,,

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyone is upset, sad and afraid,Ã¢â‚¬Â one SDF member from the Kurdish-dominant Syrian city of Kobane told Fox News. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a historic mistake. We wanted to be part of America. We are surrounded by enemies, and ISIS isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even finished yet.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Most who spoke to Fox News were scared to use their names or publish their faces, in case the Assad-controlled Syrian regime retakes the area and retaliates against those who have spoken out. But most of all, the millions in the region left in limbo are concerned about strikes from the Turkish side of the border.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyone is confused and scared. This will mean that Turkey will likely attack us. We are in shock because we thought the U.S. would help us achieve peace after ISIS. We didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think that they would help us defeat the terrorists and then leave us alone to face the horror of Turkish forces and its extreme factions,Ã¢â‚¬Â lamented Mazloum Kurdy, a 33-year-old father and teacher from Kobane. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now people are thinking to displace themselves from their homes here again, but nobody knows where a safe place to go is.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In his words, it is an ultimate betrayal by the United States.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“People are crying; they can taste the displacement that will come. They know it will be a cold winter and their first after ISIS,Ã¢â‚¬Â Kurdy continued. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And for all the people who worked for the US, they have no place to go because they are wanted from four sides. From Turkish because they worked with the SDF, from the regime because they will be conscripted and forced into the Army, from the Free Syrian Army and maybe even from the Kurdistan government in Iraq because they worked with the SDF. We just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Earlier this year, Turkish-backed forces took control of the Kurdish-dominant town of Afrin, prompting a quagmire for the United States as many were forced to abandon their posts fighting ISIS and fight for Afrin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a fight that was ultimately lost. In recent days, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to imminently launch a similar offensive against the Kurdish troops trained and equipped by the U.S to battle ISIS.  Turkey's issue is that elements of the SDF are members of the People's Protection Units (YPG), a military force generally considered an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an on-and-off separatist war against Turkey since the 1980s. The PKK is a designated terrorist organization both in Turkey and the United States, and the YPG's involvement in the region has been a hot point of contention between the Turkish government and the U.S.  Just hours after White House announced it will pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, the State Department announced plans to sell $3.5 billion worth of Patriot surface-to-air missiles to Turkey.  Nonetheless, Dana W. White, Chief Defense Department spokesperson, stated Wednesday they have Ã¢â‚¬Å“started the process of returning U.S. troops home from SyriaÃ¢â‚¬Â as they Ã¢â‚¬Å“transition to the next phase of the campaign.Ã¢â‚¬Â White declined to provide further details Ã¢â‚¬Å“for force protection and operational security reasons.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Sources told Fox News the abrupt decision Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which appeared to have been leaked before all arrangements were put in place and part of a non-disclosed timeline that had been put in place without the knowledge of many Ã¢â‚¬â€œ came as a sudden surprise, and that many involved in Syria were simply Ã¢â‚¬Å“not happyÃ¢â‚¬Â about the withdrawal.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“And by withdrawal, it is complete, down to zero,Ã¢â‚¬Â one Pentagon insider said, noting that it will likely take a little over a month to complete.  Kurdish leaders were said only to be informed of the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision Wednesday. And over the course of several meetings over the past few days, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis tried Ã¢â‚¬â€œ apparently unsuccessfully Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to dissuade Trump from the decision.  Abandoning the Kurdish allies, some officials fear, will not hinder future efforts to enlist local ground troops globally but will only further embolden enemy forces.  And while President Trump tweeted that ISIS is Ã¢â‚¬Å“defeated,Ã¢â‚¬Â others on the ground disagree, underscoring the brutal terror group stubbornly remains holed up in pockets near the Iraq border, and under daily assault by the SDF.  Aykan Erdemir, a former member of the Turkish parliament and a senior member at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said the announcement couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have come at a better time for Turkish President Erdogan.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The U.S withdrawal from Syria would be a great gift for the Turkish president in the run-up to the country's upcoming municipal elections scheduled for March 2019. The Turkish leader will present this as a win against the U.S. and exploit it to boost his image at home,Ã¢â‚¬Â Erdemir said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Syria pullout would also open the way for Ankara's cross-border operations against Syrian Kurdish rebels, offering Erdogan another rally-round-the-flag opportunity during the campaign period. Today's news will, therefore, be celebrated not only in Tehran and Moscow, but also in Ankara.Ã¢â‚¬Â  STRIKES AGAINST SYRIAN REGIME BOLSTER LOCALS' HOPES THAT U.S. WILL STAY FOR LONG HAUL  Joost Hiltermann, International Crisis Group's Middle East Program Director, concurred problems could loom.  ""The decision, if carried out precipitously, would leave the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces twitching in the wind. Both Turkey and Syria want to eliminate the YPG as a military actor,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Trump administration should use the leverage of its intended withdrawal to negotiate a deal that would restore Syrian sovereignty over its border but grant a degree of autonomy to the Kurds and also prevent the return of ISIS"".  Others argue Trump is only doing what he intended to do all along.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“While we must always worry about the long-term ramifications of removing U.S. forcesÃ¢â‚¬â€they can act as a stabilizing force in the regionÃ¢â‚¬â€by and large, at only 2,000 or so troops, they are not a game changer in Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â asserted Harry Kazianis, an expert at the Center for the National InterestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Director of Defense Studies. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This should not impact the Kurds in any dramatic way as long as Washington is able to coordinate its actions in a way the does not destabilize or let anyone think they can fill a vacuum left by WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â€such as Turkey or say Russia.Ã¢â‚¬Â  INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS FEARS FOR CITY IN SYRIA IT CAN'T REACH WITH AID  In early April, soon after Trump remarked that U.S. troops would be pulling out Ã¢â‚¬Å“very soon,Ã¢â‚¬Â concerns were already bubbling over in the Syrian streets.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The most important thing is we know we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be bombed when the U.S. is here,Ã¢â‚¬Â Khalid, a 31-year-old mobile phone seller and a graduate of Homs University. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If they leave, we worry Russians will be the first to come and bomb us. Right now we are calm and comfortable.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Mahmoud, a 60-year-old purveyor of sweets, also expressed gratitude over being spared the aerial bombardment that has ravaged much of Syria. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Of all the players in Syria, America is better than the others,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven years of this war and no one else has come to take care of us.Ã¢â‚¬Â  But for now, their future is anybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guess. Ã¢â‚¬Å“People consider the USU cheated because we thought they wanted to bring stability to Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â Kurdy added. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But right now, people are praying and hoping the decision might change.Ã¢â‚¬Â",en,terrorattack,565,['US']

NATO allies France and Germany said Washington's change of course on Syria risks damaging the fight against Islamic State, the militant group that had seized swathes of Iraq and Syria but has now been squeezed to a sliver of Syrian territory.  Advertisement  Several of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress, joined by opposition Democrats, urged the president to reverse course, saying the withdrawal would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in Syria and enable a resurgence of Islamic State.  Trump, however, gave no sign of changing his mind and lashed out at Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is sometimes an ally of the president but who has said a withdrawal would have ""devastating consequences"" for the United States.  ""So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of US$US$US$,"" Trump tweeted. ""Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying & killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran & other locals? Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!""  Trump's troop announcement on Wednesday upended a pillar of American policy in the Middle East and caused consternation in domestic and foreign critics who argued it would make it harder to find a diplomatic solution to Syria's seven-year civil war.  Advertisement  Advertisement  France, a leading member of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, said it would keep its troops in northern Syria for now and contested Trump's assertion that the group has been defeated in the country.  ""Islamic State has not been wiped from the map nor have its roots. The last pockets of this terrorist organisation must be defeated militarily once and for all,"" French Defence Minister Florence Parly said on Twitter.  France has about 1,100 troops in Iraq and Syria providing logistics, training and heavy artillery support as well as fighter jets. In Syria it has dozens of special forces, military advisers and some foreign office personnel.  Trump, however, tweeted that he was fulfilling a promise to leave Syria made during his presidential campaign and arguing that the United States was doing the work of other countries and it was ""time for others to finally fight.""  Four U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the troop withdrawal is expected to mean an end to the U.S. air campaign against Islamic State in Syria. The U.S.-led air war has been vital to crushing the militants there and in neighbouring Iraq, with more than 100,000 bombs and missiles fired at targets in the two countries since 2015.  Still, one U.S. official said a final decision on the air campaign had not been made and did not rule out some kind of support for partners and allies.  The United States told the U.N. Security Council it was committed to the ""permanent destruction"" of Islamic State in Syria and would keep pushing for the withdrawal of Iranian-backed forces in the country.  The roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, many of them special forces, were ostensibly helping to combat Islamic State but were also seen as a possible bulwark against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken much of the country from his foes in the civil war, with military help from Iran and Russia.  The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have been fighting Islamic State with U.S. support for three years, said the withdrawal of troops would let the militants regroup at a critical stage and leave Syrians stuck between ""the claws of hostile parties"" fighting for territory in the civil war.  The SDF are in the final stages of a campaign to recapture areas seized by the militants.  But they face the threat of a military incursion by Turkey, which considers the Kurdish YPG fighters who spearhead the force to be a terrorist group, and Syrian forces committed to restoring Assad's control over the whole country.  The SDF said the battle against Islamic State had reached a decisive phase that required more support, not a precipitate U.S. withdrawal.  THREAT ALIVE  Islamic State declared a caliphate in 2014 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq. The hardline group established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.  According to U.S. estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kms (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under its control and estimated revenues of nearly US$1 billion a year.  A senior U.S. official last week said the group was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held. It has no remaining territory in Iraq, although militants have resumed insurgent attacks since the group's defeat there last year.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said he largely agreed with Trump that the group had been defeated in Syria but added there was a risk it could recover.  He also questioned what Trump's announcement meant in practical terms, saying there was no sign yet of a withdrawal of U.S. forces, whose presence in Syria Moscow calls illegitimate.  Israel will escalate its fight against Iranian-aligned forces in Syria after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.  While Turkey has not commented directly on Trump's decision, an end to the U.S.-Kurdish partnership will please Ankara.  Kurdish militants east of the Euphrates in Syria ""will be buried in their ditches when the time comes,"" state-owned Anadolu news agency reported Defence Minister Hulusi Akar as saying.  Turkey has intervened to sweep YPG and Islamic State fighters from parts of northern Syria that lie west of the Euphrates over the past two years. It has not gone east of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces.

2415087,channelnewsasia,None,'Neither war nor peace': Doctors targeted in Syria's lawless rebel region,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/neither-war-nor-peace-doctors-targeted-in-syria-s-lawless-rebel-11054494,,22/12/2018 5:20,"ISTANBUL: Doctor Khalil Agha was working at a hospital in northwest Syria when masked gunmen knocked at his door, waved a piece of paper saying he was wanted by a powerful Islamist group, and bundled him into their car, bound and blindfold.  The surgeon, whose captors demanded US$100,000 (Ã‚Â£79,051) for his freedom, was one of 10 medical personnel who doctors say have been seized this year in a rebel-held region sinking into anarchy.  Advertisement  A deal between Russia and Turkey three months ago averted a Syrian army offensive to recapture the region, centred around Idlib province. But cuts in foreign funding - both to militant groups and local police struggling to assert some order - have undermined security.  Now medical workers are feeling the impact as armed gangs compete for influence and money. Doctors are targeted because they are well-known, comparatively well-paid and inclined to express views that put them at odds with their kidnappers.  For the first five years of the civil war, until the end of 2016, there were almost no attacks on medics, said Munther Khalil, head of the Idlib Health Directorate. ""But in the last two years, there have been explosive devices that target our cars, car thefts, detentions and assassination attempts.""  Four months ago Agha was working a shift at his hospital in eastern Lattakia province, near Idlib, when he heard a knock. He opened the door to find two armed men who told him he was wanted by a court run by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which controls much of the region.  Advertisement  Advertisement  They tied his hands and covered his eyes. ""It wasn't until they released me seven days later that I saw daylight,"" he said.  His kidnappers accused him of working with Turkey, foreign NGOs and another Syrian opposition group and demanded US$100,000 from his wife. She sold her jewellery and his car, and borrowed money from as many people as she could to pay the ransom.  NORTHWEST UNREST  The arrival of tens of thousands of fighters and civilians from defeated rebel enclaves elsewhere in Syria has made a bad situation worse in the northwest, the last major bastion of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.  ""The number of factions increased, and the fighting between factions increased as some groups took control and others went extinct,"" Agha said.  ""Everyone started working alone, according to their own agenda - religious or political - leaving no one in complete control,"" he said.  The area is held by an array of rebels, the most powerful being Tahrir al-Sham, an amalgamation of Islamist groups dominated by the former Nusra Front - an al Qaeda offshoot until it distanced itself from the group in 2016.  Other groups fight under the rebel Free Syrian Army banner with Turkish backing, in an alliance called the ""National Front for Liberation"".  Foreign payments to several factions were halted following a U.S. decision to halt its funding programme last year, cutting off groups that depended almost wholly on donations from outside and driving some to kidnapping to make ends meet.  Earlier this year, a cut in British support ended funding for projects including an independent police force.  The Free Syrian Police, which operates only in rebel-held areas outside the control of Tahrir al-Sham, was unarmed in accordance with a deal with Western backers - the United States, Britain, Denmark, Netherlands, Canada and Germany.  Since the funding ended, some policemen have taken up arms. But they cannot defend civilians and doctors against kidnappings by armed groups in areas out of their control.  ""We don't have a magic wand,"" said Colonel Maher Ghrebeh.  The funding cut also forced policemen to find other jobs to make ends meet, undermining their security work, said General Fouad al-Sweid, head of the Idlib Free Police. ""Policemen are being forced to leave work and go work in their olive groves, harvest potatoes, work as labourers or bakers.""  ""NEITHER WAR NOR PEACE""  Over the summer, doctors in Idlib went on a three-day strike to protest against the kidnappings and rampant insecurity. Some doctors started carrying small arms for protection, though others said that would not protect them.  ""What good would a light weapon be in the face of an armed group?"" said one pharmacist who was recently abducted.  The pharmacist, who asked not to be named, was doing his rounds in a village in Idlib when he was stopped by masked men. Armed and riding a pickup truck with a mounted rifle, the seven men forced him to abandon his car, blindfolded him and took away his phone.  They then drove him to an unidentified location and put him in a dark, guarded room, where he was held for five days and tortured. They sent recordings of the torture to his wife and demanded US$150,000 in exchange for his release.  The pharmacist's wife sold all her jewellery and borrowed money until she had US$18,000, negotiating the armed group down to that amount and won his release.  Agha didn't go back to his hospital for three months after being freed, and he now has a list of 29 people he owes money.  He says he's still afraid, but despite friends warning him against returning, he's back doing surgery at the hospital.  In the relative lull which followed September's truce, Agha says they almost miss the bombs.  ""We wish for bombardment and clashes, because people get distracted,"" he said with a weak laugh. ""The situation we're in, neither war nor peace, is a disaster.""  (Reporting by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by Dominic Evans and Giles Elgood)",en,terrorattack,,

One official said the troops could be out by summer, but no final decision has been made.  President Donald Trump has long pushed to pull troops out of Afghanistan, considering the war a lost cause. But earlier this year, he was persuaded by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and others military leaders to keep troops on the ground to pressure the Taliban and battle a stubborn Islamic State insurgency. Officials said the latest White House push for withdrawal was another key factor in Mattis' decision to resign Thursday.  The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.  U.S. troops stormed into Afghanistan in November 2001 in an invasion triggered by the Sept. 11 attacks.  Since then, America has lost more than 2,400 soldiers and spent more than $900 billion in its longest war. Three U.S. presidents have pledged to bring peace to Afghanistan, either by adding or withdrawing troops, by engaging the Taliban or shunning them, and by struggling to combat widespread corruption in the government.  The U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in 2014, but American and allied troops remain, conducting strikes on the Islamic State group and the Taliban and working to train and build the Afghan military.  Taliban insurgents, however, control nearly half of Afghanistan and are more powerful than at any time since a 2001 U.S.-led invasion. They carry out near-daily attacks, mainly targeting security forces and government officials.  In recent months, however, there has been a renewed effort to make progress on peace talks with the Taliban. Officials now worry that any move to withdraw U.S. troops this year could dampen those prospects and simply encourage the Taliban to wait it out until they can take advantage of the gaps when the forces leave.",en,terrorattack,571,"['US', 'Afghanistan']"

The surprise announcement by US President Donald Trump this week that he would withdraw roughly 2,000 troops has felled a pillar of American policy in the Middle East. Critics say Trump's decision will make it harder to find a diplomatic solution to Syria's seven-year-old conflict.  For Turkey, the step removes a source of friction with the United States. Erdogan has long castigated his Nato ally over its support for Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters against ISIS. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group and an offshoot of the armed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), fighting for Kurdish autonomy across the border on Turkish soil.  In a speech in Istanbul, Erdogan said Turkey would mobilise to fight remaining ISIS forces in Syria and temporarily delay plans to attack Kurdish fighters in the north-east of Syria - shifts both precipitated by the American decision to withdraw.  The news was less welcome for other US allies. Both France and Germany warned that the US change of course risked damaging the campaign against ISIS, the extremists who seized big swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014-15 but have now been beaten back to a sliver of Syrian territory.  Likewise, the US-backed militia spearheaded by the YPG said a Turkish attack would force it to divert fighters from the battle against ISIS to protect its territory.  A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said American troops may continue to operate against ISIS in Syria. The Pentagon is considering using Special Operation teams based in Iraq to target militants in Syria, the official said.  Related Story Israel flabbergasted by US withdrawal from Syria  Related Story Trump is now forging foreign policy on his own  Related Story Afghans, diplomats surprised by report of Trump plan to pull out US troops  Related Story Syria, Mattis, Afghanistan, shutdown: Trump ends year in chaos  The official emphasised that using special operators on the ground was one of many options being considered, was still in the planning stages and that no final decision had been made.  ISIS launched an attack on Friday in Syria's south-east against the US-backed SDF militia, employing car bombs and dozens of militants.  ""We will be working on our operational plans to eliminate ISIS elements, which are said to remain intact in Syria, in line with our conversation with President Trump,""Erdogan said.  The Turkish president had announced plans last week to start an operation east of the Euphrates River in northern Syria to oust the YPG from the area that it largely controls. This week, he said the campaign could come at any moment. But on Friday, he cited the talk with Trump as a reason to wait.  ""Our phone call with President Trump, along with contacts between our diplomats and security officials and statements by the United States, have led us to wait a little longer,"" he said.  ""We have postponed our military operation against the east of the Euphrates river until we see on the ground the result of America's decision to withdraw from Syria.""  Erdogan said, however, that this was not an ""open-ended waiting period"" and that, due to past ""negative experiences"", Ankara welcomed the United States' statements with an equal amount of pleasure and caution.  Turkey has repeatedly voiced frustration over what it says is the slow implementation of a deal with Washington to pull YPG fighters out of Manbij, a town in mainly Arab territory west of the Euphrates in northern Syria.  The United States will probably end its air campaign against IS in Syria when it pulls out troops, US officials have said. Erdogan's foreign minister said the withdrawal plan would be discussed by the two countries in Washington in January.  'TIME FOR OTHERS TO FIGHT'  Trump maintained that ISIS had been wiped out, a view not shared by key allies, that Washington had been doing the work of other countries and it was ""time for others to finally fight"".  His defence secretary, James Mattis, opposed the decision and abruptly announced on Thursday he was resigning after meeting with the president.  In a candid letter to Trump, the retired Marine general emphasised the importance of ""showing respect"" to allies that have voiced surprise and concern about the president's decision.  Russia said on Friday it did not understand what the United States' next steps in Syria would be, adding that chaotic and unpredictable decision-making in Washington was creating discomfort in international affairs.  Several of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress, joined by opposition Democrats, urged the president to reverse course, saying the withdrawal would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in Syria and enable a resurgence of Islamic State.  Trump has given no sign of changing his mind. He promised to remove forces from Syria during his 2016 election campaign.  The roughly 2,000 US troops in Syria, many of them special forces, were ostensibly helping to combat Islamic State but were also seen as a possible bulwark against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken much of the country from his foes in the multi-sided civil war, with military help from Iran and Russia.  ISIS declared a caliphate in 2014 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq. The ultra-hardline Sunni militants established their de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.  A senior US official last week said ISIS was down to the last 1 per cent of the territory it once held. The group has no remaining territory in Iraq, though militants have resumed attacks since their defeat there last year.  ISIS launched an attack on Friday on positions held by the SDF in Syria's southeast and the US-led coalition mounted air strikes in the area, an SDF official said.

After nearly four years of relentless conflict in Yemen, the world has grown used to images of war, killing and destruction.

There's a danger rolling news coverage can make viewers de-sensitised to prolonged conflict, especially to the human suffering. But sometimes, a single event can make the world sit up and take notice.  A bombing on August 9, 2018, in the northern Yemeni city of Saada, near the border with Saudi Arabia, was one such event.  Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the world.  In 2011, a revolution, part of the so-called Arab Spring, overthrew President Ali Abdullah Saleh.    The armed group in the north of Yemen, the Houthis, took advantage of the instability. They moved south and ultimately captured the capital, Sanaa, seizing power from the government of new President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.  This Houthi takeover prompted a group of Arab states - led by Saudi Arabia and including the United Arab Emirates - to launch an all-out attack on Houthi positions in March 2015, saying that the Houthis were supported by Iran.  In August 2018, an international news story circulated, saying that coalition forces had hit a bus carrying children on a summer school excursion in Saada, close to the Saudi border.  ""Saudi forces bombed a school bus. It managed to shock a lot of people. This is a school bus. This is not a military target,"" said Andrew Smith, spokesman for Campaign Against Arms Trade.  Fifty-one people, including 40 children, were killed and 77 others injured in the Saada attack.  The International Red Cross said their medical team at the al-Talh hospital there received the bodies of 29 children, all aged under 15. The hospital also treated 48 injured patients of whom 30 were children.  The Saada bus bombing triggered international condemnation, and the UN Security Council called for a credible and transparent investigation into the incident.  This film looks at what happened that day and how planes deployed by the Saudi-UAE coalition managed to bomb a bus full of Yemeni school children in Saada, killing nearly everyone on board.

Courtesy Matthew Crane/U.S. Army/Handout via REUTERS  Colonel Muhanad al Talaa, leader of Maghawir al-Thawra whose several hundred fighters work alongside U.S. troops at the Tanf camp, said although they were notified of WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision, the situation on the ground remained as it was.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“American troops plan to withdraw completely form Syria but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have details and things are as they are up until this moment,Ã¢â‚¬Â Talaa told Reuters from the base.  The garrison is located in a strategic area near SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tanf border crossing with Iraq at the crossroad of a main Baghdad-Damascus highway, TehranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main arms supply route by land to Syria and LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful Hezbollah militia.  Russia and the Syrian government have repeatedly called on Washington to pull its troops from the Tanf base, where it has declared a 55 km (35 mile)-radius Ã¢â‚¬Å“deconfliction zoneÃ¢â‚¬Â which has become a safe haven for at least 50,000 civilians, mostly women and children, who live in the Rukban camp within it.  The garrison was first set up when Islamic State fighters controlled eastern Syria bordering Iraq but since the militants were driven out, Tanf has assumed a role as part of a U.S. strategy to contain IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military buildup in eastern Syria.  Tanf is the only position with a significant U.S. military presence in Syria outside the Kurdish-controlled north, where it has much larger air bases  Only several months ago, U.S. marines held major rare exercises in the base in what Western military officials said was a strong message to Russia and Iran that the Americans and the rebels it supports intend to stay.  A western diplomatic source and a regional intelligence source told Reuters the decision to leave Tanf will not necessarily affect the broader U.S. strategy against Iran, where regional power Israel will continue its aerial strikes.  Israel has in the last year hit several suspected Iranian-backed militia convoys and bases near Tanf where IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proxies are expanding their foothold, especially in the city of AlBukamal to the northeast of the base, another intelligence source involved in Syria said.  WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision means an even bleaker future for these camp dwellers for whom the camp was a safe haven as many fear retribution if they return back to their towns in Syrian government-controlled areas in eastern Syria, residents say.

A second blast went off nearby shortly afterward, as a plume of smoke rose over the capital and ambulances were arriving on the scene.  The Shabaab, an Islamist group linked to Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for both blasts in a broadcast on its Radio Andalus. The group said the second explosion had also been a car bomb.  A police official, Capt. Mohamed Hussein, said the bomber had targeted a military checkpoint near the rear entrance of the heavily fortified palace. Another police spokesman, Col. Ahmed Mohamud, said the death toll included civilians and soldiers.  Among those killed were a prominent journalist, Awil Dahir Salad; two security personnel; and a driver working for the local station Universal TV, whose car was passing the checkpoint at which the first blast went off, according to another reporter, Abdiasis Ibrahim, who works for the London-based Universal TV.  Among the wounded were the deputy mayor of Mogadishu, Mohamed Tuulah, and a former regional official, Warsame Jodah, according to local news reports.  Saturday is a business day in Somalia, and lawmakers and other officials had been traveling nearby when the explosions ripped through the area.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“At first I saw a vehicle driving to and fro, then we tried to stop people walking here and there, and then in the blink of an eye the vehicle exploded, causing havoc,Ã¢â‚¬Â a traffic police officer, Mohamed Harun, told The Associated Press.  The Shabab have carried out a relentless campaign of attacks in Mogadishu, sometimes targeting civilians. The groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s members want to dislodge the central government and impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law.  The Shabab have lost much of their territory after being forced out of Mogadishu since 2011 as a result of attacks by African Union forces and increased American air power. But they remain a potent killing force.  In October 2017, a double truck bombing killed more than 380 people and injured hundreds of others, the worst attack in decades.

Boubker Sabik, spokesman for the Moroccan security and domestic intelligence services, also said the arrest of nine more people in the case had foiled a terror plot.  Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were found dead early on Monday near the village of Imlil on a route to Toubkal, North AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest peak and a popular hiking and trekking destination.  Sabik said on the state 2M TV channel that the four suspects, aged between 25 and 33 years, had headed to the Imlil area intent on committing a crime but without selecting their target in advance.  They had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video made on the Friday before the bodies were found, but without agreeing this in advance with any foreign entity.  Sabik described the four as ""lone wolves"". ""The crime was not coordinated with Islamic State,"" he said. ""Lone wolves do not need permission from their leader,"" he added, without explaining how the authorities had come to their conclusions.  One of them was arrested in 2013 as part of a crackdown on individuals who wanted to join extremists abroad, he said, adding that this suspect had radicalised the other three.  However, he dismissed reports that one was a returning foreign fighter from the Middle East. All four, who originated from the outskirts of Marrakech, had only informal jobs and had a low level of education, he added.  Referring to the nine other suspects detained on Friday in various Moroccan cities, he said their arrests ""spared Morocco a terrorist plot"".  Electronic devices, an unauthorised hunting rifles, knives and materials that could be used for bomb-making were found in the course of those raids.  Sabik gave no details of this suspected plot but said Morocco is stepping up efforts to counter security threats posed by the return of Islamic State fighters from Syria and Iraq.  So far 242 out of 1,669 Moroccans who joined the militant group had been arrested, he said. Some fighters were using false passports and trying to hide among refugees heading for Europe as the jihadists suffer setbacks in the Middle East.  Authorities were still trying to authenticate a video that has been shared on social media purporting to show the beheading of one of the victims. ""The video has no background and the clothes of the victim are not identical to those in reality,"" he said.  Compared with other countries in North Africa, Morocco has been largely insulated from militant attacks. The most recent took place in April 2011, when 17 people were killed in the bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech. In 2017 and 2018, Morocco dismantled 20 militant cells planning attacks in the country.  (Reporting by Ahmed Eljechtimi; editing by David Stamp)",en,terrorattack,,

The attack began in the afternoon when a suicide bomber blew up a car outside the Ministry of Public Works.  Shooting followed, with hundreds of government employees inside the building, said Interior Ministry official Nasrat Rahimi. No group immediately claimed responsibility.  Rahimi said two militants had been killed but gunmen in a nearby government building were exchanging fire with security forces.  ""More than 200 people have been evacuated by the security forces, but many are still being held as hostages by the militants,"" he said.  At least four people wounded in the clashes were taken to hospital, according to a spokesman for the health ministry.  An official working in a nearby government building said employees had locked themselves in their offices after hearing the explosions and gunfire.  Attacks on government offices are frequent and are generally carried out by the Islamist Taliban, who are fighting to expel foreign forces from strategic provinces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law.  The 17-year-old war with the Taliban has seen both fighting and diplomacy intensify in recent months.  On Thursday, an official said U.S. President Donald Trump was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a day after Trump unexpectedly announced that U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn.  The United States went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, seeking to oust the Taliban militants harbouring Saudi-raised militant Osama bin Laden, who led plans to carry out the attacks.

US troops there, he said in a video the same day, are ""all coming back, and they're coming back now.""  But in between both statements, his Defense Secretary James Mattis and the US special envoy on fighting ISIS, Brett McGurk, had resigned. Senior Republican Senators had openly criticized the abrupt withdrawal.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that ""there is no change in our commitment to the defeat of the caliphate or of ISIS globally,"" but has also maintained that it can be done without the 2,000 US troops that currently support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in northern-eastern Syria.  For its part, the US Defense Department says the withdrawal is conditions-based and not subject to ""an arbitrary timeline.""  The rest of this article could be spent trying to divine the US policy in Syria. But it's easier to ask whether ISIS is defeated or not.  For sure, it's a shadow of what is was at the zenith of the self-declared Caliphate, when it controlled territory the size of Hungary. But it is far from vanquished, either as a fighting force or an ideology.  Beyond Syria, there are signs that it's regenerating in Iraq. A UN report in August estimated that some 20,000 to 30,000 ISIS fighters were still at large in the two countries.  And ISIS affiliates -- from West Africa to Indonesia -- show no sign of folding their tents.  The ""Hajin Pocket""  Several hundred ISIS fighters still control territory along the Syria-Iraq border. It was there last weekend that two British soldiers were reportedly wounded by a rocket or missile attack during clashes in the ""Hajin pocket"", an area of some 20 square kilometers where networks of caves and tunnels enable ISIS fighters to survive.  Kurdish forces on the ground, supported by western special forces and airstrikes, have battled to eliminate the ISIS presence in Hajin for months. Between December 9 and 15 alone, the US-led coalition conducted 208 airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, the vast majority around Hajin.  Hardly a sign of operations winding down, let alone the liquidation of ISIS in Syria.  ISIS has also been able to conduct offensive operations. It has exploited poor weather to attack Kurdish forces, killing dozens of them in one engagement in November and releasing videos of those it had captured.  There are also signs that ISIS cells are active around Raqqa, once the group's self-declared capital. ISIS claimed on Monday that it was responsible for a suicide attack in the city in which several people were killed or injured.  Recovering in Iraq  There are also indications that ISIS is regrouping in Iraq, albeit in small numbers. Iraqi officials and counter-terrorism analysts say ISIS cells have infiltrated the sparsely-populated Hamrin mountains south of Mosul, which was the last major city in Iraq occupied by the group.  They have exploited the fault line between the government in Baghdad and the Kurdish regional authorities -- and the fact that civilians have not returned to many villages because of poor security and infrastructure.  Security in Baghdad is much improved, symbolized by the reopening of the high-security Green Zone in December after 15 years. But ISIS, which regards Shia Muslims as apostates, targeted Shia neighborhoods of the Iraqi capital in simultaneous bomb attacks in October and November.  Elsewhere, it has assassinated security officials in Diyala province, Sunni tribal leaders in Nineveh province and carried out ambushes on the main highway linking Baghdad and Mosul. A car bomb near a restaurant in Mosul in November killed several people.  The pattern of coalition airstrikes in Iraq over the past few months also suggests that ISIS retains a presence in the deserts of western Iraq.  JUST WATCHED Bolton contradicts Trump on Syria withdrawal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bolton contradicts Trump on Syria withdrawal 02:36  Nor is ISIS short of money. It is believed to have stashed away hundreds of millions of dollars from oil revenues and taxes levied while it occupied large parts of Iraq and Syria. Long before the Caliphate was declared, ISIS ran sophisticated extortion rackets in Mosul. One source tells CNN some of its cash pile has been laundered through businesses in Turkey.  In October, the US Treasury imposed sanctions today on an Iraq-based money services business that had been moving money for ISIS, describing it as part of a ""complex network of money services businesses, hawalas [informal money exchange businesses] and financial facilitators funding terrorism across the Middle East.""  At the same time, Kurdish commandos in Iraq arrested eight men in a raid on an ISIS financial network in northern Iraq.  The ISIS diaspora  The appeal of ISIS' ideology -- which once drew hundreds of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria -- has dimmed with the loss of the Caliphate -- but it has not died.  Affiliates pledging their allegiance, in West Africa, Libya, Yemen, the Philippines and Indonesia to name just a few places, are still active. A pro-ISIS group is suspected of bombing a shopping mall in the Philippines on New Year's Eve, an attack which killed two people.  ISIS may not be able to direct attacks in Europe any more, but radicalized individuals still aspire to carry out attacks in its name. Cherif Chekatt, who killed five people in Strasbourg in December before being shot dead, had recorded a video of support for ISIS. He had been radicalized in prison and was on France's security watchlist -- but so are 29,000 others.  According to security analysts Globsec , 97% of the jihadis responsible for terror attacks in France since 2012 were already known either for radicalization or by the police.  But the task of tracking militants who might move from word to deed is beyond security agencies -- in France or anywhere. Should ISIS show remarkable powers of recuperation despite the international efforts to destroy it, its appeal to would-be militants beyond the Middle East might grow again.  The future  The current situation in Syria and Iraq suggests that recuperation has begun. A vast stretch of territory either side of their border lacks governance and security. Rural and remote, it is ideal for an insurgency, especially one as deep-rooted and well-organized as ISIS.  Hassan Hassan, who has followed the group's evolution and is co-author of ""ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror"", sees the group's strategy as ""sahraa, sahwat, sawlat"" -- the Arabic words for the desert, opponents within the Sunni community, and hit-and-run attacks.  The group's roots are rural; it has long maintained that holding cities is irrelevant to its existence.  It has focused on attacking Sunni ""collaborators"" for over a decade and is now staging ambushes and ""flying checkpoints"" in Iraq to make its presence felt.  It may be helped by what is frequently an arbitrary campaign by the Iraqi state to punish alleged ISIS sympathizers. New research by Kristen Kao and Mara Revkin at the University of Gothenburg shows that this heavy-handed ""victors' justice"" may yet push some of the Sunni population back into the arms of ISIS.  Should the US withdrawal from Syria proceed without a deal between the Kurds and the Syrian regime and without assurances from Turkey that it will not attack the Kurds -- which it regards as a terrorist group -- the coalition stitched together to defeat ISIS will quickly unravel.  The idea that Turkey can pick up the slack against ISIS is unrealistic: it lacks the capacity and access to areas where ISIS is still active. And whatever guarantees it might offer, Ankara's prime target inside Syria would be not ISIS, but the Kurds.  As Hassan Hassan has written , if the US ""simply leaves, new wars will almost certainly be reignited between Turkey and the YPG, the Arabs and the Kurds, and the opposition and the YPG.""  And that would suit the remnants of ISIS fine.",en,terrorattack,,

France has been on alert for African swine fever since the virus was confirmed in September among wild boar in neighbouring Belgium. The disease, harmless for humans, is often deadly for pigs, and outbreaks in eastern Europe and China have disrupted the pork industry there.  Advertisement  After the virus was found this month in wild boar in Belgium only about 1 km (less than a mile) from France, the French government announced plans to cull all wild boar in a high-risk zone by the border and put up tens of kilometres (miles) of fencing in a wider area to avert an outbreak of African swine fever.  ""To cull rapidly wild boar in the 'white zone' and halt African swine fever, general mobilisation of hunters with the logistical support of the army,"" Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume said on his Twitter feed.  The minister told France 2 television earlier that there were between 500 and 600 wild boar to be culled in the designated white zone and it would take two to three weeks.  Army personnel would assist by laying traps or rounding up boar for hunters to shoot, a ministry spokesman said, adding that soldiers would not be firing.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The boar-free zone spans 78 square km and will be enclosed by a 1.5 metre-high fence under construction on the French side, as well as fencing erected by Belgian authorities at the border, the French agriculture ministry has said.  France plans to put up in total around 100 km (60 miles) of fencing around border areas in the northeast at a cost of several million euros, according to the ministry.  African swine fever can be carried by wild boars but experts also stress that human factors such as transport, clothing and food waste can play a role in spreading the disease.  No vaccination or treatment exist for the highly contagious virus.  Last year's outbreak among wild boar in Belgium marked a sudden westward spread of the virus in Europe, raising the risk it would reach large pork-production countries like Germany, France and Spain.  Belgium has faced restrictions from importing countries on its pigmeat exports, although African swine fever has yet to be detected on a pig farm.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has insisted the Adana Protocol gives his country the right to intervene militarily in the neighboring country.  Turkey and its Syrian rebel proxies control part of northern Syria, and Ankara has repeatedly threatened another military operation against Kurdish fighters on its southern border.  On Saturday, the foreign ministry in Damascus accused Ankara of repeatedly breaching the Adana deal throughout Syria's 8-year war.  ""Since 2011, the Turkish regime has violated and continues to violate this agreement,"" a ministry source said, quoted by state news agency SANA.  The source accused Turkey of ""supporting terrorists,"" using the regime's usual term for both jihadists and rebels.  It said Ankara was breaching the deal through ""occupying Syrian territory via terrorist organisations linked to it or directly via Turkish military forces.""  Rebel backer Turkey has twice led incursions into northern Syria in 2016 and 2018, since when its forces and allied Syrian proxies have controlled a patch of territory on the border.  Ankara has repeatedly threatened to march on areas further east, where Kurdish fighters it views as ""terrorists"" have led the US-backed battle against the Islamic State jihadist group.  Washington last month said it would pull all its troops from the war-torn country, leaving the Kurds scrambling to find a new ally in Damascus to avoid a Turkish assault.  On Friday, Erdogan said Turkey expected a ""security zone"" to be created in Syria in a few months.  Turkey accuses the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) which have led the fight against IS of being an extension of its outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  The Adana deal was signed in 1998 to end a crisis between the neighbors, sparked by the then presence in Syria of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and bases run by the group.  Turkey argues the protocol provides Ankara with the legal ground to intervene in Syria against the PKK and its affiliates, because of the Syrian regime's failure to act against the group.  Damascus has regained control of almost two-thirds of the country after significant Russia-backed victories against rebels and jihadists since 2015, and hopes to see all areas of the country revert to its rule.  Syria's war has killed 360,000 people and spiralled into a complex conflict involving world powers since starting in 2011 with the repression of anti-government protests.

The attack wounded 77 and was one of the deadliest in recent years in a region long plagued by instability. It came amid hope and excitement about the ratification of a devolution plan that aims to bring development, jobs and peace to one of AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poorest and most volatile places.  The first explosion went off inside the cathedral on Jolo island, in Sulu province, and was followed by a second blast outside, that was detonated as security forces raced to the scene, officials said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The enemies of the state have boldly challenged the capability of the government to secure the safety of the citizenry in that region,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Salvador Panelo, spokesman of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The armed forces of the Philippines will rise to the challenge and crush these godless criminals.Ã¢â‚¬Â  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but police suspect the bombings were the work of the Abu Sayyaf, a militant group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State and is notorious for its bombings and brutality.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They want to show force and sow chaos,Ã¢â‚¬Â national police chief Oscar Albayalde told DZMM radio, suggesting the Abu Sayyaf group was the prime suspect.  Jolo is a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf, which runs a lucrative piracy and kidnapping operation that successive governments have failed to break up. The group, which operates in the waters and islands of western Mindanao, has beheaded numerous foreign captives when ransom payments were not met.  Pictures distributed by the military of the inside of the Jolo church showed several rows of wooden pews destroyed, with debris strewn across a blackened floor. Humvees and army trucks were lined up on the road outside.  The attack followed FridayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s announcement that the region, a mainly Muslim part of the predominantly Catholic Philippines, had ratified the creation of an autonomous area called Bangsamoro, with 85% of voters behind it.  Although Sulu was among only a few areas that rejected autonomy, it will still be part of the new entity when it is fully formed in 2022.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœDastardly actÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana called the attack a Ã¢â‚¬Å“dastardly actÃ¢â‚¬Â and urged the local population to cooperate and Ã¢â‚¬Å“deny terrorism any victoryÃ¢â‚¬Â.  National Security Adviser, Hermogenes Esperon, called those responsible Ã¢â‚¬Å“mass murderersÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“extremist criminalsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will not allow them to spoil the preference of the people for peace,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  Civilians bore the brunt of the attack, which also killed seven soldiers. Sixty-one civilians were among those wounded.  The referendum came amid concerns about the presence of extremists in the Philippines and the possibility that foreign radicals will join those of Indonesia and Malaysia in gravitating to Mindanao to capitalize on porous borders, jungles and mountains, and an abundance of arms.  The Philippine military in mid 2017 encountered its biggest and longest battle since World War Two when an alliance of extremists loyal to Islamic State, among them foreigners and children, overran Marawi City and tried to establish a caliphate.

At around 8.30am yesterday, a bomb ripped through a Roman Catholic cathedral in Jolo, a poverty-racked island of some 700,000, in the mainly Muslim province of Sulu, in the Philippines' restive south.  Hundreds stampeded out through the main door.  But the carnage was not over yet.  Minutes later, as first responders, mostly army troops and police, arrived on the scene, a second blast tore across a parking lot just outside the church compound.  By late afternoon, Chief Superintendent Graciano Mijares, police chief in the region that covers Sulu, had tallied at least 20 dead, and over 100 wounded, including 14 soldiers and two men from the Coast Guard.  The initial explosion mowed down a large section of wooden pews inside the cathedral's main hall. The second bomb, said to have been rigged onto a motorcycle, exploded in a more crowded area, hurling human remains and debris across a town square fronting the church, named the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.  Images on social media and photos filed by wire agencies showed a grisly scene of bodies covered with blankets lying on a busy street.  President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a text message: ""The (military) will rise to the challenge and crush these godless criminals... We will pursue to the ends of the earth the ruthless perpetrators behind this dastardly crime until every killer is brought to justice and put behind bars.""  No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.  ""We don't have any lead yet. We're looking at different threat groups in the area. We can't say yet if this has anything to do with the recent plebiscite,"" said director-general Oscar Albayalde, the police chief.  But Mr Mujiv Hataman, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) that covers Sulu, told the online news site Rappler he was ""99 per cent certain"" the Abu Sayyaf, a gang of self-styled Islamist militants founded in the 1990s, was behind the attack.  Related Story ISIS claims responsibility for Philippines church bombing  Related Story Historic vote for Muslims, but no guarantee of peace in Mindanao  Abu Sayyaf has attacked the cathedral at least twice before, with grenades, in 2010 and 2013.  A report in the Inquirer, citing a university professor in Jolo who has dealt with militants as a peace advocate, said the military uncovered a plot by the Abu Sayyaf to bomb Jolo as early as five months ago.  It prompted security forces to close the street in front of the cathedral, said Professor Octavio Dinampo. After 20 days, though, the street was reopened.  The Abu Sayyaf has long used Sulu as a base, carrying out kidnappings and bombings.  It has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  KILLERS WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE The enemies of the state have boldly challenged the capability of the government to secure the safety of the citizenry in that region. The (military) will rise to the challenge and crush these godless criminals... We will pursue to the ends of the earth the ruthless perpetrators behind this dastardly crime until every killer is brought to justice and put behind bars. The law will give them no mercy. MR SALVADOR PANELO, President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman, in a text message.  Though the group officially has a separatist Islamist agenda, it has capitalised on decades of instability in Mindanao to generate tens of millions of dollars from piracy and ransom payments. It is still holding at least five hostages - a Dutch national, two Malaysians, an Indonesian and a Filipino - in their jungle bases mostly near Sulu's Patikul town, not far from Jolo.  The latest attack came nearly a week after more than 1.5 million Muslims, a minority in the predominantly Catholic nation, overwhelmingly approved a more powerful autonomous region in the Philippines' south.  They had voted for the new, self-administered region called the ""Bangsamoro"", or nation of Moros, in the war-torn island of Mindanao, in hopes of ending nearly five decades of a separatist rebellion that has left over 150,000 people dead.  Voters in Sulu, however, rejected it. Still, the province will be included in the new Bangsamoro region, as it is part of the ARMM, which as a bloc voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Bangsamoro law.  That has raised fears of reprisals by militant groups. Those fears seem to have come true.",en,terrorattack,580,"['Top', 'Top', 'Top']"

Duterte and his top security officials on Monday visited the site of the bombing, Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, in the southern Sulu provincial capital on Jolo island. He reportedly walked slowly into the bombed cathedral, where the wooden pews were still in disarray less than a day after twin explosions were set off.  The first blast sent people, some of them wounded, running out the church's main door. Army troops and police officers were rushing inside when the second bomb exploded a minute later.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is an act of terrorism,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who was with the president. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is not a religious war.Ã¢â‚¬Â  BOMBING OF ROMAN CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL IN SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES KILLS AT LEAST 20  Lorenzana blamed the attack on Abu Sayyaf militants who have carried out years of bombings, kidnappings, and beheadings in Jolo island. The militants have aligned themselves with ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the attack.  Abu Sayyaf has an estimated 300 to 400 members, mostly in Sulu, where it is holding several foreign and Filipino kidnap victims.  Duterte later met with families of the victims at a military camp in Jolo, where coffins were laid side by side.  Police around the country were on heightened alert to prevent similar attacks.  The bombings came nearly a week after minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation endorsed a new autonomous region in the southern Philippines in hopes of ending nearly five decades of a separatist rebellion that has left 150,000 people dead.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“We expect the promise of a security zone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a buffer zone aimed at protecting our country from terrorists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to be fulfilled in a few months,Ã¢â‚¬Â Erdogan said at a rally last week. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Otherwise, we will definitely form this safe or buffer zone ourselves. Our only expectation from our allies is that they provide logistical support to TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effort.Ã¢â‚¬Â  ErdoganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comments came just a day after TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign minister also mandated that Turkey has the ability to create a safe zone in Syria on its own. Erdogan has declared that not only will such sectors protect Turkey from Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorists,Ã¢â‚¬Â but that it would allow more Syrian refugees to return their country, even under the continued leadership of Bashar al-Assad.  As it stands, Turkey hosts around four million Syrian who have fled the neighboring nation amid the long-running civil war.  But not everyone is so confident.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are looking first for security and to be safe from the regime. As long as the future of the region is not clear, there is no way for Syrians to go back,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Bassam Barandi, a former Syrian diplomat, political advisor to the High Negotiations Committee of the Syrian Opposition and co-founder of the DC-based activist organization People Demand Change. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If the regime enters, then we should expect a new wave of Arab refugees towards Turkey, and if Turkey enters, we should expect a new wave of Kurdish refugees to Iraq.Ã¢â‚¬Â  But its most important mission with a safe zone is centered on TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aim to drive out the U.S.-backed Kurdish PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Protection Units (YPG), escalating a long-simmering point of contention between Ankara and Washington. While the YPG is viewed as a critical and effective ground force in the U.S. battle against ISIS, Turkey perceives them as a wing of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has long been deemed a terrorist group given their decades-long violent struggle for separatism.  INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS FEARS FOR CITY IN SYRIA IT CAN'T REACH WITH AID  WHY I LEFT ISIS: FORMER BAGHDADI 'FRIEND' AND AIDE, OTHERS SPEAK OUT  Turkey has threatened to launch a new offensive against the Kurdish fighters in northern Syria for months, and last week shelled YPG positions in the region of Tal Rifaat, of which they control a portion. But Erdogan held off plans for a full-scale offensive after President Trump made the unexpected decision last month to commit to withdrawing all 2,000 troops from Syria, effectively handing over reign and responsibility in the region to Turkey.  But over the ensuing weeks, cracks have emerged between the two NATO allies over the agreement as US officials have warned Turkey not to attack the Kurds while Turkey has maintained its position to clear the area east of the Euphrates River.  Trump has tweeted several times over the prospect of establishing a Ã¢â‚¬Å“20-mile safe zoneÃ¢â‚¬Â in Syria, which is a key component of the Syria withdrawal plan, but little detail has been publicly provided as to what exactly it would look like and who would herald control.  A similar U.S. endeavor to work with Turkey fell apart in 2016 after Turkey and its Syrian allies went beyond the bounds of pre-agreed terms with the U.S., which was focused on fighting ISIS, and went on to attack Kurdish posts. The actions prompted US officials to promptly stop support for the coordinated mission.  And despite Trump and ErdoganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier espousals to work together on a revived safe zone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ some remain skeptical of TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role as the main guarantor.

Security officials tagged six ""persons of interest"" from the Ajang-ajang faction of the Abu Sayyaf as the main suspects. The Abu Sayyaf has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which claimed responsibility for the attack.  When asked what Mr Duterte wanted the military and the police to do, Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters: ""On the Abu Sayyaf, crush them (for the bombings), and for all the atrocities they have committed so far.""  Mr Lorenzana accompanied Mr Duterte during a brief visit to Jolo town in Sulu province, where the militants set off two blasts that tore through the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel during mass early on Sunday morning.  A senior military official said the Ajang-ajang faction was formed in 2014 and consists of no more than 60 kin - mostly teenagers - of Abu Sayyaf militants killed over the years by security forces.  Ajang-ajang is an ethnic term in Sulu that means ""sons of warriors"" or ""sons of martyrs"".  The military official, who asked not to be named because he was disclosing sensitive information, said the faction had never ventured out of Jolo Island, and mostly stuck to extortion, drug dealing and spotting hostages for the Abu Sayyaf.  Related Story At least 20 killed as twin bombing hits southern Philippine church  Related Story Philippines vows to wipe out Abu Sayyaf militants over church bombings  Mr Rommel Banlaoi, executive director of the Philippine Institution for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, told CNN Philippines the group had apparently levelled up to ideology-fuelled revenge killings.  He named Hatib Sawadjaan, an ISIS sympathiser and father-in-law of Malaysian militant Amin Baco, as among the leaders of the Ajang-ajang faction.  Baco was at one time rumoured to have been designated as the new ISIS emir in South-east Asia, replacing Isnilon Hapilon, the Abu Sayyaf chieftain killed in the 2017 siege of southern Marawi city.  The church attack came nearly a week after over 1.5 million Muslims in the predominantly Catholic nation overwhelmingly approved a more powerful autonomous region in the south. They voted for the new region called Bangsamoro, or nation of Moros, in hopes of ending nearly five decades of separatist rebellion and reining in a new wave of Islamist extremism sweeping war-torn Mindanao Island.  Voters in Sulu, however, rejected it. Still, the province will be included in the new region as it is part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, which as a bloc voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Bangsamoro law.  That has raised fears of reprisals by militant groups, who are opposed to any peace deal with the government and are opting instead to embrace ISIS' wider agenda to establish a caliphate in South-east Asia.  The country's 170,000-strong police force is now on ""heightened alert status"". This means more checkpoints and patrols, especially around shopping malls, train and bus stations, airports, harbours and other vulnerable targets.  Worst attacks in the Philippines  SIMULTANEOUS BLASTS  On a holiday to remember the country's national hero, Jose Rizal, near-simultaneous bombings in December 2000 killed 22 people and injured more than 100 in Manila. One explosion rocked a plaza across from the US Embassy. Blasts also tore through a train, a passenger bus and a cargo handling facility at the international airport.  DEADLIEST ATTACK  A February 2004 firebombing of a ferry in Manila Bay, which killed 116 people, was the country's deadliest terror attack.  The ship was engulfed in flames as it sailed out of Manila Bay with 899 people on board. Many of them were rescued by small vessels in the area.  The notorious Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group, which is suspected of being behind Sunday's church bombing, claimed that it had planted an explosive on board the vessel.  MARKET EXPLOSION  At least 15 people were killed and scores more wounded in December 2004 when a bomb blast tore through a public market in General Santos, one of the biggest Christian-majority cities in the south of the mainly Catholic Philippines.  KILLED WHILE SLEEPING  Gunmen launched a raid in the town of Maluso on the southern island of Basilan in February 2010, killing 11 people. Many of the victims were sleeping when their homes were strafed with bullets. Buildings were later torched. Abu Sayyaf was blamed for the violence.  ATTACK IN PRESIDENT'S HOME TOWN  A September 2016 bombing that ripped through a bustling night market in President Rodrigo Duterte's home town left 15 dead, and was blamed on the Maute gang of Islamist militants that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.  The authorities said the militants carried out the violence partly to raise its profile with ISIS.  MARAWI SIEGE  Marawi, the nation's principal Islamic city, was besieged from May to October 2017 by hundreds of heavily armed local and foreign gunmen who the authorities said aimed to establish a South-east Asian base for ISIS.  Swathes of the southern city were destroyed in five months of house-to-house fighting between troops and the Islamists from the Abu Sayyaf and Maute groups that killed nearly 1,200 people.  The attackers were ultimately dislodged, but only after some of the worst urban fighting the nation had seen since World War II.  VAN BOMB  Ten people, including troops and civilians, were killed when a bomb in a van blew up at an army checkpoint in Basilan in July last year. The powerful explosion, claimed by ISIS, occurred after soldiers and pro-government militiamen stopped the vehicle for a search just after dawn. The authorities believe the attacker intended to target a children's event in a nearby town, but set off the bomb on being intercepted.

OMAR OIL FIELD, Syria - Red-and-white scarves tied around their eyes, men suspected of belonging to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group sit in the back of a pickup truck in the desert of eastern Syria.  US-backed forces have singled them out from hundreds of men fleeing what remains of the extremist group's dwindling bastion on the border with Iraq.  Backed by US-led coalition air strikes, the Syrian Democratic Forces, a grouping of Kurdish and Arab fighters, have advanced against the militants, squeezing them into a tiny patch east of the Euphrates River.  The fighting and air strikes have led more than 36,000 people to flee since the start of December, including more than 3,100 suspected militant fighters.  On Wednesday (Jan 30), more than 300 men arrived near Omar oil field, where the Kurdish-led SDF separated them into two groups: civilians and suspected militants.  The alleged fighters are blindfolded, ushered into the truck and ferried off for questioning by the SDF.  Inside the tent, a few hundred men vetted as civilians sit, some wearing their traditional red-and-white scarfs on their heads.  Most of them sporting the long beard that was compulsory under ISIS rule, they wait to be trucked to a camp for the displaced in Kurdish-held territory further north.  ""All Syrians raise your hands,"" says an SDF fighter, and just a handful do so.  All the rest, he says, are Iraqis - mostly from the neighbouring Iraqi province of Anbar.  The men AFP interviewed spoke of a lack of food and medicine inside what remains of the ISIS pocket, and of bodies lying under rubble in the streets after air strikes.  ""There are lots of air strikes,"" 17-year-old Ashraf Wissam says, adding he lost all his family in the raids.

2478322,channelnewsasia,None,Pregnant women with severe flu more likely to have poor birth outcomes: Study,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/pregnant-women-with-severe-flu-more-likely-to-have-poor-birth-11193044,,1/2/2019 12:30,"Pregnant women so sick with influenza that they're admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are more likely to have premature and underweight babies than expectant mothers with milder flu and those who don't catch flu at all, a recent study suggests.  Researcher compared birth outcomes for 490 pregnant women in five states who contracted the H1N1 strain of influenza-A in 2009, as well as 1,451 women without the flu who gave birth that year and 1,446 women without flu who gave birth the previous year.  Advertisement  Compared to women who either didn't get the flu or had mild cases, women admitted to the ICU with severe H1N1 infections were almost four times more likely to have premature babies and more than four times as likely to have underweight infants, the study found.  Women admitted to the ICU were also more than eight times as likely to have babies with low Apgar scores, an assessment of overall wellbeing done right after birth.  ""This study supports data from previous studies that have shown increased risks for infants born to pregnant women who are severely ill with flu,"" said lead study author Kim Newsome of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.  Severe flu infections in pregnant women are generally rare. But the increased risk they present for these poor health outcomes in babies highlights the importance of vaccinating pregnant women against the flu and treating their flu cases with antivirals early to avert severe illness, the study team writes in Birth Defects Research.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Among women in the study with confirmed or suspected flu infections, 82 were so sick they were admitted to the ICU or died. Another 338 were hospitalised, but not in the ICU, and 70 were not hospitalised. Except for the 82 severe cases, none of the women with less-severe flu had higher rates of poor birth outcomes compared to women without flu.  This isn't surprising. But it offers fresh insight into how the illness can impact birth outcomes, Newsome said by email.  ""The first and most important step for pregnant women and those who might be considering pregnancy to reduce their health risks and risks to their infants is getting a flu shot,"" Newsome said. ""In addition, it's important for pregnant women to get prompt treatment with antiviral medications if they get sick.""  Other everyday things like handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces where germs can lurk can also help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses like the flu, Newsome advised.  The flu virus spreads from person to person through droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking close to infected individuals, and can be picked up from surfaces like doorknobs where these droplets can linger, according to the CDC.  Symptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, aches and pains, headaches, chills and fatigue. While most people with the flu can recover without medical treatment, some people develop serious complications that require hospitalization. Pregnant women, infants, the elderly, and people with certain chronic medical problems are particularly vulnerable to flu complications.  Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the lack of data on individual patient characteristics like income and education that can impact birth outcomes, the researchers note.  The study also didn't adjust results based on whether women had obesity or diabetes, which can both increase the risk of preterm and underweight babies and make people more likely to experience serious complications from influenza.  Even so, the findings underscore the importance of vaccination, said Dr Julie Shakib, a pediatrics researcher at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who wasn't involved in the study.  ""The best defense against influenza is for pregnant women to get the flu vaccine as soon as soon as it is available,"" Shakib said by email.  This is the best tool a pregnant mother has against influenza during pregnancy and improves her likelihood of delivering a healthy infant, Shakib added. For optimal protection against influenza after pregnancy, parents and caregivers should get vaccinated every year, as should all babies six months and older.  ",en,diseas,,

Almost 1 million pigs have been slaughtered over the past six months as the country battles African swine fever. And with no sign of the disease coming under control, more culls are set to come which could cripple the domestic pig farming industry.  China produces more than half the world's pigs -- 700 million a year. Most of those stay within China's borders, with just 1.6 million exported last year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.  African swine fever is not harmful to humans and is unlikely to become zoonotic -- pass from animals to humans -- in our lifetime, says Dirk Pfeiffer, an expert in infectious diseases at City University of Hong Kong. But the most virulent strain of the disease is almost 100% deadly to pigs.  The Chinese government has set up epidemic zones across the country, restricted the movement of live pigs, and closed live pig markets in affected areas. Pfeiffer said that if not brought under control, the outbreak could ruin millions of small pig farms across the nation.  Read More",en,diseas,,

In a briefing for journalists in London attended by Fox News, Ben Wallace, the Security Minister, said while the so-called Islamic State has been ""massively degraded...it hasn't gone away.  Officials here now estimate some 900 Brits have gone to fight with ISIS in recent years. About half of them were either killed or gave up. The other half are hardened militants still remaining in the Mideast region or in other failed states including Africa. British officials note that the time between radicalization and attacks has shortened thanks to the nature of the internet.  During the briefing, Wallace also said he believes British journalist John Cantlie is alive. Cantlie, a war photographer was captured by the group Ã¢â‚¬Å½over six years ago along with American journalist James Foley, who was subsequently beheaded. Cantlie, however, has been used in several propaganda videos. Wallace would not comment on where it's believed Cantlie currently is and any efforts by Britain to free him. The last video to feature Cantlie was released by ISIS in December 2016.  WHERE IS BAGHDADI? INSIDE THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE ISIS LEADER, THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED MAN  Wallace's comments come amid reports that two other British ISIS fighters, nicknamed ""The Beatles,"" could face trial in a U.S. court. They allegedly participated in ISIS terror including the videoed executions of American prisoners before being captured. Wallace's Home Office argued for sharing evidence with the U.S. and their transfer but against sending them to Guantanamo.  After somewhat of a lull, Britain was hit by five deadly terror attacks on its soil in 2017. The wave of bloody strikes, which included a suicide bomb attack at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, resulting in the deaths of 22 people, was branded a ""wake-up call.""  OBAMA LIED ABOUT SYRIA 'RED LINE', SET MIDDLE EAST BACK 20 YEARS, TOP SAUDI OFFICIAL SAYS  Wallace appeared to regret the decision by the Trump administration to withdraw US troops from Syria.  ""Without the coalition there, they are no help to anyone,"" he said. He also noted the possible loss of information on ISIS activities, adding : ""If you don't have 'feet on the ground' you're going Ã¢â‚¬Å½to have less intelligence.""  WORLDWIDE TERROR ATTACKS SHRINK TO SEVEN-YEAR LOW, NEW STUDY SHOWS  As for the effect on counter-terrorism that the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union will have, Wallace acknowledged some efforts would be made ""sub-optimal."" He said the ability for the U.K. to make quick arrests on the European mainland would be lessened, but he also noted Britain will have stronger control of its borders, potentially keeping out would-be threats from the continent.  Still, Wallace believes that cross-border cooperation, especially between the U.K. and the U.S. in dealing with terrorism Ã¢â‚¬Å½remains high.

Ismail's father Muhammad Ismail told Al Jazeera through a text message late on Wednesday night that she has been released and is on her way home.  The other 17 activists belonging to the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), including its central leader Idrees Mehsud, remain under detention in the Adiala prison.  Their arrest on Tuesday evening was described by rights groups as the latest round of repression of the PTM by Pakistani authorities.  #GulalaiIsmail has finally been released.

Ismail and other PTM members were arrested shortly after they held a demonstration in Islamabad for the rights of Pakistanis living in conflict zones.  The PTM has frequently accused Pakistan's powerful military, which has ruled the country for roughly half of its 71-year history, of rights abuses, including a campaign of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.  'They were very rude'  Ismail and other PTM members were charged with violating Section 3 of the MPO, which gives the government wide-ranging powers to arrest people suspected of acting in a manner ""prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order"".  190111140428304  Mohammad Ismail said his daughter shared her location with him via messaging service Whatsapp while being arrested and it showed she was being held at a police station.  ""The police behaviour with us was extremely unhelpful,"" he said. ""They did not let us meet her, and they were very rude.""  Later, police told Ismail his daughter had been transferred, but did not disclose her whereabouts.  ""We had been looking for her all day today,"" he told Al Jazeera earlier on Wednesday.  Latest round of repression  Gulalai Ismail was one of dozens of PTM activists attending a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Islamabad protesting the death of Arman Loni, a PTM activist who was allegedly killed in police custody on Saturday.  181126091906107  Loni, a university professor, was taken into custody in the southwestern district of Loralai while at a PTM protest demonstration. PTM activists say he was killed by police after his arrest.  Police say he died during clashes between police and protesters. On Monday, the Balochistan government ordered an inquiry into the incident.  Authorities in Islamabad claimed the protest against the killing was illegal as it had taken place without their permission.  ""If protesting was illegal, then how was the Jamaat-ud-Dawa able to protest outside the press club yesterday at the same time?"" asked Manzoor Pashteen, the leader of the PTM. ""How can they have permission to protest and we don't?""  Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), led by Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, is the charitable arm of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) armed group. Sanctioned by the United States and the United Nations, the group has also been listed by Pakistan's interior ministry as a suspected front for LeT.  JuD was holding a demonstration to mark Pakistan's state-sanctioned Kashmir Solidarity Day, a day of demonstrations across the country to protest Indian security forces' ""occupation"" of India-administered Kashmir.  The arrests of PTM activists on Tuesday are the latest in a fresh crackdown on the organisation, which shot to prominence last year when it held countrywide demonstrations attracting thousands of people to protest rights abuses allegedly carried out by the Pakistani military in its war against the Taliban.  On January 22, prominent PTM leader Alam Zeb Mehsud was arrested on charges of ""inciting a riot"" after addressing a peaceful protest demonstration in the southern city of Karachi.  Ismail herself was one of a number of PTM leaders, including its chief Pashteen, who were charged with treason for holding a protest demonstration in her native Swabi district in August.  In October, she was detained at Islamabad airport on arrival in the country in connection with that case.  PTM leaders and activists are frequently subjected to travel restrictions. This week, Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir, both also members of parliament, were barred from entering Balochistan to attend the funeral of Loni, the university professor who was allegedly killed by police.

Outside the ""Baghouz pocket"", the plains were littered with empty pistachio-coloured rocket shells, water bottles, clothes left behind, and rotting dog carcasses.  Advertisement  The extremist group declared a cross-border ""caliphate"" in Syria and Iraq in 2014, but various military campaigns have chipped it down to a fragment on the Iraqi border.  After a pause of more than a week to allow out civilians, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared a last push to retake the pocket from the extremists on Saturday.  Aided by the warplanes and artillery of a US-led coalition, the Kurdish-led alliance has pressed into a patch of four square kilometres (one square mile).

Syrian Democratic Forces fighters stand guard as a convoy transports civilians fleeing the battered Islamic State group holdout of Baghouz.

""The progress is slow and methodical as the enemy is fully entrenched and IS fighters continue to conduct counter attacks,"" he said.  ""The coalition continues to strike at IS targets whenever available.""  'SIX HOURS? IN THE COLD?'  On Monday, the Observatory said a coalition air strike killed 16 civilians.  An Italian journalist was also wounded as he covered the clashes and evacuated for treatment, a colleague said on Twitter.  The SDF launched the battle to expel IS from the eastern province of Deir Ezzor in September, slowly tightening the noose around the militants and their families since December.  In the past two months, more than 37,000 people, mostly wives and children of militant fighters, have fled into SDF-held areas, the Observatory says.  That figure includes some 3,400 suspected militants detained by the SDF, according to the Britain-based monitor, which relies on sources inside Syria for its information.  At a gathering point for new arrivals, dozens of men knelt on the ground.  Iraqi and Syrian women and children prepared to make the long journey north to a Kurdish-held camp for the displaced, after spending the night in tents.  A very thin child with dark circles around his eyes stumbled onto a truck, as other children screamed out for water and their mothers asked how long the drive would take.  ""Six hours? In the cold?"" shouted a wrinkled Iraqi woman.  Bali, the SDF spokesman, said on Saturday that up to 600 militants could still be left inside the pocket.  But the group's elusive leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi who proclaimed the ""caliphate"" in 2014 was likely not there, he said.  Women and children flee the Islamic State group's last pocket of territory in Syria in a truck. (Photo: AFP/Fadel Senna)  Inside the crumbling redoubt, Iraqis are now in charge, according to those fleeing it and the SDF, as a rift has emerged between them and non-Arabic speaking foreigners.  'NEXT WEEK'  At the height of their proto-state, Baghdadi's followers implemented their brutal implementation of Islamic law in an area the size of the United Kingdom.  But various offensives, including by the SDF and Russia-backed regime forces, have taken back all but a morsel of that territory near the village of Baghouz.  Once the ""caliphate"" is declared over, the fight will continue to tackle IS sleeper cells, the SDF and their allies have said.  The militant group retains a presence in eastern Syria's vast Badia desert and has continued to claim deadly attacks in SDF-held areas.  US President Donald Trump on Monday said the coalition may declare victory over IS in the region within days.  ""Soon it will be announced, soon, maybe over the next week, maybe less,"" he told a rally in the US city of El Paso.  Trump shocked Washington's allies in December by announcing a pullout of all 2,000 US troops from war-torn Syria.  The decision has left Syria's Kurds scrambling for protection from Damascus against a long threatened attack by neighbouring Turkey.  After decades of marginalisation, the Kurds have largely stayed out of Syria's eight-year civil war, instead setting up their own semi-autonomous institutions in the northeast of the country.  Syria's war has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions since starting in 2011 with the repression of anti-government protests.  ",en,terrorattack,597,['Syria']

BETHNAL GREEN GIRLS  Image: Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase  Shamima Begum is one of three British schoolgirls who left their homes in east London and travelled to Syria in February 2015.  The 19-year-old said one of the trio, Kadiza Sultana, married an American IS fighter and was killed after her house in Raqqa was bombed.  She is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on the then IS-stronghold in May 2016, but that has never been confirmed.  Shamima Begum said: ""Her house was bombed. Underground, there was secret stuff going on and a spy had figured out that something was going on and other people got killed as well.  ""At first I was in denial. I thought if we died we'd die together.""  The fate of the third schoolgirl Amira Abase, who Shamima Begum said married an Australian IS militant, is unknown.  Inside Islamic State's last village  The trio had followed another friend from their school, Sharmeena Begum, who fled to Syria in 2014 and married a Bosnian IS fighter.  Shamima Begum said she last saw Amira Abase and Sharmeena Begum in June, but had heard from other IS brides only two weeks ago, that the pair were ""still alive in Baghuz"", the terror group's last-remaining enclave in Syria.  AQSA MAHMOOD  Image: Aqsa Mahmood joined IS at the age of 19  The Bethnal Green pupils were reported to have been indoctrinated by the al-Khansaa Brigade, an all-female IS religious unit which enforces Sharia law, in which Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood was believed to be a prominent figure.  The suspected IS recruiter joined the militants in Syria at the age of 19 - two years before the east London trio - in November 2013.  She travelled through Turkey to Aleppo, and has also reportedly encouraged terrorist acts via Twitter under the name Umm Layth.  In the summer of 2017, Aqsa Mahmood was reportedly one of 150 suspected jihadists and criminals stripped of their British citizenship and banned from returning to the UK by the government.

Jones uses her Twitter account to recruit women to IS, share pictures of herself with weapons, and has provided practical advice on how to travel to Syria  Raqqa: Inside Islamic State's prison of death  In an exclusive report in 2015, Sky News revealed Jones and her husband used online messaging services to urge British would-be recruits to carry out ""lone wolf"" attacks in the UK.  In one conversation with an undercover journalist, Jones detailed the materials needed to make a bomb and said she could help construct a device remotely.  Her husband was killed in a US drone strike in August 2017.  Following the death of Hussain, Jones was reportedly placed in charge of the female wing of the Anwar al-Awlaki batallion - an IS foreign fighter unit formed with the purpose of planning and executing attacks in the West.  LINDA WENZEL  Image: German teenager Linda Wenzel was captured by Iraqi forces in Mosul  One teenager who is reportedly serving a six-year prison sentence for joining IS is 18-year-old German, Linda Wenzel.  She joined the jihadists when she was 15, having been lured to Raqqa by a Chechen IS fighter whom she went on to wed.  Wenzel was 16 when she was captured by Iraqi forces in Mosul in 2017 and was apparently found under rubble in the war-torn Iraqi city.  She travelled to Turkey in July 2016 with the aim of reaching Iraq or Syria before security services lost track of her.  Wenzel was described as an IS sniper hiding with 30 women, some wearing suicide vests, when she was found.  She was reportedly captured with a gun in her hand next to her husband, who was then killed by Iraqi forces.  Her trial took place behind closed doors, due to her age, in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.  Wenzel escaped the death penalty but was jailed for five years for joining IS and a further year for entering Iraq illegally, German media reported last February.

This came as Kurdish-led forces closed in on the small town of Baghouz, where ISIS fighters and their relatives were hunkered down, and met hundreds of famished and dishevelled people turning themselves in.  ""The fighting is fierce,"" said Mr Adnan Afrin, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-Arab outfit that has been spearheading the campaign against ISIS with backing from a US-led coalition.  ""There is significant resistance,"" he said at Al-Omar oilfield, the main staging base for the SDF's offensive against the very last shred of the original ISIS ""caliphate"".  The few hundred fighters of various nationalities holding out in their last bastion by the Iraqi border have launched bruising counter-attacks in recent days, Mr Afrin said.  The Islamists are clinging to about one square kilometre in the town's built-up area, as well as to an adjacent camp, where a number of civilians are believed to be gathered.  Mr Afrin said it was impossible to provide accurate figures, but he estimated the total number of fighters - men and women - at 1,000. ""There are many tunnels in Baghouz now. This is why the operation is dragging on. There are many suicide bombers attacking our positions, with explosives-laden cars and motorbikes.""

Meanwhile, hundreds of people are continuing to trickle out of the last ISIS redoubt daily, trudging up a dirt road to a collection point where SDF fighters and volunteers provide first aid and carry out a first screening. Many of those who fled had had to sleep outside in the cold to reach that point, where a lucky few get tents while the rest were spread out on cheap blankets.  ""This is the second night we sleep outside. There was so much bombing in Baghouz that it was safer for us to sleep in the open,"" said Fatima, an Iraqi woman from Baghdad who fled Baghouz with her four children, all under 15.  The US-led coalition is carrying out air strikes on the area, while its forces are also present on the ground, sifting through the displaced for wanted extremists.  Mr Afrin said SDF forces tuning their walkie-talkies on the militant's frequencies ""can hear them speak in Arabic, but also in Turkish, French and English"".  Once the adult men have been separated from their families, foreign and SDF officers thumb through pictures on smartphones to ask new arrivals about wanted ISIS leaders.  The terrorist group's elusive Iraqi-born supremo, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is not believed to be among the last ISIS leaders holed up in Baghouz. Several known Islamist figures have emerged from the dregs of the ""caliphate"" in recent days, however, including German Martin Lemke and Frenchman Quentin Le Brun.  A rift appears to have grown between foreign members of ISIS - who have nowhere to hide - and local fighters, who are attempting to blend back into the population as the organisation goes underground again.  An official declaration of victory against ISIS is expected in the coming days, a move of mostly symbolic value that will go down as the death certificate of the ""caliphate"", even as the terror organisation remains a threat.

SINGAPORE - Two radicalised Singaporeans, one of whom was based in Johor and had been supporting the top Malaysian ISIS fighter in Syria, have been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA).  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced on Friday (Feb 15) that businessman Mohamed Kazali Salleh, 48, and his Singapore-based friend Hazim Syahmi Mahfoot, 28, a freelance car exporter, were issued detention orders last month.  The Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) also announced on Friday that they had arrested Kazali and five other individuals in operations in Johor, Selangor and Sabah in the past two months for involvement in militant groups.  News of these latest arrests came as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria's (ISIS) caliphate has been dismantled, with several hundred mostly foreign fighters making their last stand to defend an area under 1 sq km near Syria's border with Iraq.  However, security authorities remain concerned that the extremist ideology that fuelled the group remains active, and will continue to spread as foreign fighters seek to return home as well as export their battles to South-east Asia and elsewhere, including through social media.  In Kazali's case, he had funded and been in active contact with Syria-based ISIS militant Wan Mohd Aquil Wan Zainal Abidin, also known as Akel Zainal, MHA said.  Akel, who was a member of 1990s Malaysian rock band Ukays, reportedly instructed two Malaysian ISIS supporters to attack places of worship and police stations in Malaysia early this year. The plots were foiled when the supporters were arrested last November.  Syria-based ISIS militant Wan Mohd Aquil Wan Zainal Abidin, also known as Akel Zainal.  Photo: Facebook/Pejuang Muda Masakini  In December, Kazali received instructions from Akel to carry out an attack against a Freemasons centre in Johor Baru, but did not follow through as he was afraid to be caught by the authorities, the ministry added.  The RMP said Kazali was arrested in Johor Baru on Dec 19, as a result of co-operation with Singapore's Internal Security Department (ISD).  He was deported and handed over to ISD on Jan 7 after being interrogated by Malaysia's Special Branch.  Kazali had relocated to Malaysia with his family when he was a young child, and had been working in Johor Baru over the past decade.  Giving an account of Kazali's involvement with terror, MHA said he first met Akel in 2009 and became strongly influenced by Akel's radical views and conspiracy theories.  He was convinced by Akel's belief that Muslims are duty-bound to travel to Syria to fight against those who oppress Muslims.  So when Akel decided to go to Syria to fight in late 2013, Kazali gave him financial assistance for the trip.  ""His material assistance to Akel continued when Akel was in Syria, and in turn, Akel had kept him updated on his exploits on the battlefield,"" MHA said.  ""Kazali believed that the help he gave to Akel would guarantee him a place in paradise should Akel achieve martyrdom in Syria.""  As Kazali became increasingly radicalised, he saw ISIS fighters as ""righteous"" individuals defending Muslims in Syria and around the world.  At Akel's urging, he took a bai'ah or pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, which was conveyed to Akel via social media, MHA said.  He also agreed to join Akel in Syria when invited, but he did not act as he was not ready to leave his life in Malaysia behind, the ministry added.  Instead, he took to sharing news of Akel's terrorism-related activities on social media to inspire others to travel to Syria, and was prepared to facilitate such travel.  As for Hazim, MHA said that he met Kazali in May 2018 in Singapore.  They had business dealings, quickly developed a personal friendship, and Hazim was influenced by Kazali's radical outlook.  ""Hazim looked up to Kazali and was convinced by Kazali that he should undertake armed violence against the perceived enemies of his religion, specifically non-Muslims. Hazim believed that all Muslims are duty-bound to travel to conflict zones such as Palestine, Syria and Myanmar to fight non-Muslims there,"" the ministry said.  ""He took a bai'ah (pledge) to remain loyal and obedient to Kazali, even if it involved carrying out attacks and killing others,"" it added.  MHA, in its statement, noted that ISD and Malaysia's Special Branch co-operated closely on investigations into Kazali's terrorism-related activities and his links with Akel.  ""These cases highlight the dangers of radicalisation of Singaporeans overseas, and the potential impact within Singapore. The threat of extremism is one which does not respect national borders,"" it said.  This article was first published in The Straits Times. Permission required for reproduction.",en,terrorattack,,

Relatives of Adil Ahmad Dar, who according to police carried out the suicide attack on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy and killed 44 of them on Thursday, mourn inside Adil's residence in Gundbagh village in south Kashmir's Pulwama district, February 15, 2019. REUTERS/Danish Ismail  Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has claimed responsibility for ThursdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car bomb attack on a security convoy, the worst in decades of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only Muslim majority state. It comes months before a key Indian general election.  Adil Ahmad Dar, 20, from the village of Lethipora in Indian Kashmir, rammed a car full of explosives into the convoy, escalating tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which both claim the rugged Himalayan region.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are in pain in the same way the families of the soldiers are,Ã¢â‚¬Â said farmer Ghulam Hassan Dar, adding that his son had been radicalised after police stopped him and his friends on the way home from school in 2016.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They were stopped by the troops and beaten up and harassed,Ã¢â‚¬Â Dar said, adding that the students were accused of stone-pelting. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Since then, he wanted to join the militants.Ã¢â‚¬Â  A video released by the militant group after the attack showed his son, dressed in military fatigues and carrying an automatic rifle, detailing his plan to carry out the bombing.  His mother, Fahmeeda, corroborated her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He was beaten by Indian troops a few years back when he was returning from school,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This led to anger in him against Indian troops.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Both parents said they were unaware of their sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan to attack the convoy.  Dar did not return home from his work as a labourer on March 19 last year, Fahmeeda added. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We searched for him for three months,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Finally we gave up efforts to bring him back home.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Reuters could not independently verify the two accounts. A spokesman for IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Anger over the attack is growing in India, which accuses Pakistan of backing separatist militants in divided Kashmir. Pakistan denies that, saying it offers only political support to the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suppressed Muslim people.  Jaish, one of the most deadly groups operating in Kashmir, has been designated a terror group by the United Nations since 2001.  Slideshow (3 Images)  Ghulam Hassan Dar said he blamed politicians for his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.

The move by India's home ministry came days after a suicide attack on Indian paramilitary forces that killed 42 Indian troops in the restive region and raised fears of a confrontation with Pakistan.  On Sunday, a formal order was issued to remove government protection given to the region's four separatist leaders because of the attack.  ""In view of the recent terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy in Lethpora village in Pulwama, the government of India has emphasised the need to immediately review the wastage of police resources in providing unnecessary security to a large number of non-government persons, particularly relevant in the context of security provided to separatists and their sympathisers,"" the order said.  The announcement could lead to further crises in the region, which has been engulfed in violence for years, analysts said. Last year was the deadliest in nearly a decade, with the highest number of casualties of rebels, security personnel and civilians.  More polarisation  In the past, several Kashmiri separatist leaders have been assassinated under mysterious circumstances.  While India has blamed Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI for its role in eliminating leaders for their alleged willingness to compromise on the disputed region, pro-separatist leaders in Jammu and Kashmir state have also been a thorn in the side of Indian security agencies.  Ajai Sahni, a defence and security analyst based in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera: ""The entire orientation of this [BJP] government as far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned has been directed towards their own electoral interest.""  ""They [BJP] use polarisation as a principal weapon for whatever they have been doing in the region, and this step will feed more polarisation. This is essentially going to appeal to the constituency who have been demanding these things for a long time. It is not a considered move by the state apparatus. It is a political move. If these people are under threat, the state cannot simply remove their security,"" he said.  Sahni said there has been a political destabilisation in Kashmir for the past five years. ""That's why we are in a condition that we are in now,"" he said.  With separatist leaders enjoying overwhelming public support in the Muslim-majority state, any attack on them carries the potential to trigger a new law-and-order crisis in the restive state.  ""If something happens, anyone is attacked, it will impact the local situation. It will put pressure on local police and the governor,"" another security analyst, Rahul Bedi, told Al Jazeera.  Police officials in the region expressed the same fear of attacks on the Kashmiri leadership.  ""Some of these leaders have been attacked several times. It's worrying. If anything happens it will be difficult to handle,"" a senior police official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.  The latest attack has also escalated tension between India and Pakistan, with New Delhi warning Islamabad of reprisals. The Indian government has also accused the separatist leaders of ""receiving money from Pakistan and its intelligence agencies"".  Separatist leaders in Kashmir demand an independent state or a merger with Pakistan.  'Diverting attention'  Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, one of the four separatist leaders whose security was withdrawn, accused the Indian government of ""diverting the attention from the Kashmir dispute"".  ""The government provided me security. I did not ask for it. And now they have withdrawn it. Let them. They just want to divert the attention of people from the real issue, which is Kashmir's struggle for the right to self-determination,"" he told Al Jazeera.  Umar, whose father Moulvi Mohammad Farooq was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in 1990, said he would continue to ""fight against the Indian oppression in Kashmir"".  ""This won't affect us; our struggle will continue. We won't change our stand,"" Farooq said.  Another separatist leader, Abdul Gani Bhat - leader of the Muslim Conference - said ""it is a non-issue"" for them.  ""The government kept these guards in our offices and homes. It was their decision. We never told them to give us any security. I even requested them once to withdraw it. Even our security and the recent attack has no connection. They are deliberately connecting the two things,"" Bhat told Al Jazeera.  ""Without anybody guarding me with a gun, I will move freely.""  Adviser to the state governor, Vijay Kumar, told Al Jazeera the decision was made by the federal home affairs ministry and ""they are looking into some more nuances of it"".  'Knee-jerk reaction'  Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and a senior pro-India politician, called the step as ""knee-jerk reaction"".  ""Why was the security granted to them? It was because of the threat perception. And who assessed that threat perception? It was the government. Many leaders were killed and that was the basis why security was granted. That's what a country has to do for its citizens,"" Mufti said.  The killing of dozens of Indian security forces by a 20-year-old Kashmiri suicide bomber has triggered xenophobic attacks against Kashmiris in several parts of India by right-wing groups.  On Sunday, the Himalayan region observed a complete shutdown to protest the reprisal attacks.",en,terrorattack,602,['India']

Diehard ISIS members are trapped in their last patch of territory of less than half a square kilometer in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border.  They have prevented civilians from fleeing by blocking roads out of the village of Baghouz, the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighting them said on Sunday, February 17.  On a rooftop on the edges of the village, an SDF fighter told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the frequencies used by the jihadists to communicate had gone dead.  ""Now their area of control is really squeezed and they don't have as many walkie talkies. They're not talking to each other as much,"" he added.  SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali said ISIS had blocked roads out of its holdout, preventing up to 2,000 civilians from escaping.  ""Daesh has sealed off all the streets,"" he said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS  Civilians who have been able to escape reported that ISIS militants were using women and children ""as human shields,"" said Sean Ryan, a spokesman for the US-led coalition.  Thousands of people have streamed out of the so-called ""Baghouz pocket"" in recent weeks, but at a collection point for new arrivals on Sunday, dozens of tents and a few trucks sat empty.  ""It's been two days since anyone came out,"" an SDF fighter told AFP.  European security risk  On Monday, EU foreign ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the war-torn country, after appeals for a ""European solution"" to the hundreds of foreigners Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including from Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Canada and Italy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who have been arrested by the SDF for allegedly fighting with ISIS.  Kurdish-led group has repeatedly called on European governments to take back their citizens, but they have been so far reluctant.  The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.  ""The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial,"" Trump said in a tweet, using another acronym for ISIS.  Otherwise, ""we will be forced to release them. The US does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.""  Trump's tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin.  In Syria, ""it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadists) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained,"" French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez said.  If they return, ""they will all be tried, and incarcerated,"" he said, after France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens.  A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back, but authorities have not confirmed any transfer.  In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective ""European solution"" that carries the least security risks.  In Germany, foreign ministry sources said ""the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases"".  'No one will protect you'  Beyond Baghouz, ISIS retains a presence in Syria's vast Badia desert, and has claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.  ""Over the past month, more than one foreign sleeper cell was arrested in multiple areas in Syria,"" spokesman Bali said.  Any withdrawal would leave Syria's Kurds exposed to a long-threatened attack by neighbouring Turkey, which views Kurdish fighters as ""terrorists"".  They have scrambled to seek a new ally in Damascus after spending most of Syria's conflict working towards self-rule.  Eight years into the conflict that has killed more than 360,000 people, President Bashar al-Assad's government controls nearly two-thirds of the country.  Assad on Sunday warned the Kurds that the US would not protect them against Turkey.  ""No one will protect you except your state,"" he said. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,597,['Syria']

Behind the fence of a camp in Kurdish-held territory in Syria, the detainees wore long black face veils that only showed their eyes, and were accompanied by three children.  They were supervised closely by Kurdish fighters.  Around 500 foreign women have been trucked into the al-Hol camp in recent months, after being picked up by US-backed forces near villages where they had taken one by one from the fighters.  From the outset, the French women warned AFP they would not give any personal details in order to protect their families back home.  But the most talkative, a 29-year-old from the region of Lyon in France, had a message to get out.  ""We're not animals. We're human beings ... We have a heart, we have a soul,"" she said, her blue eyes staring straight ahead.  Kurdish-led forces have now hemmed the last ISIL fighters into less than 0.5sq km of territory in the village of Baghouz, and say their only choice is surrender.  'We didn't agree'  France is hesitating to bring the women thought to have belonged to ISIL and their children back.  Their repatriation is a sensitive topic in a country that has suffered a series of deadly ISIL-claimed attacks since 2015.  And French authorities are even more suspicious of men and women who stayed with ISIL until the bitter end.  The second woman, who is in her thirties, said she, her husband, and three children fled the last ISIL holdout earlier this month.  ""We didn't agree"" with the ISIL fighters, she said, with a slight southern French accent.  ""But we couldn't say anything.""  Her companion insisted ""the IS [ISIL] fighters scared us. They'd say: 'We'll slit your throats, we'll rape you'"".  After weeks of bombardment and food shortages as the Syrian Defence Forces moved in, she said she slipped $50 to a smuggler so she and her two young boys could escape.  Now both women say they are ready to go home.  But the 29-year-old has conditions: to be able to practise Islam as she sees fit and to remain close to the children she has left.  She recounts how she lost two children - aged just two and six - a few years ago in a bombardment.  But she claims she is not bent on revenge.  ""I've had my children killed. It's not tomorrow that I'm going to go and kill someone,"" she said.  'They'll rip our kids away'  The two women claim they led peaceful lives under ISIL and that their husbands held civilian jobs, but it was not immediately possible to verify their accounts.  They say they became disillusioned by the reality of living in the ""caliphate"" that ISIL proclaimed across large swaths of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014.  The group ""executed lots of people for nothing, without proof - even Muslims"", the younger woman said, claiming her husband was killed.  But they do not condemn the deadly ISIL attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper and Bataclan concert hall in France in 2015.  ""The people who did that wanted to avenge"" the French air attack in Syria, the woman from the Lyon region said.  Already, she says the pair fears what might happen to their young boys if they return to France and are arrested.  ""They'll rip our kids away from us, put them in homes and foster families,"" she said.  ""They'll be separated from each other and grow up (with values) against the education we want to give them,"" she insisted.  ""There are lots of things in France against our religion - homosexuality for example"".  Both hope that if they are put on trial they get short sentences.  ""I hope we'll be judged fairly case by case - not for everything the group did,"" the more talkative woman said.

The state-run Al Ahram agency said 10 suspected fighters were killed in the Obeidat district and another six were killed in the Abu Eita district of the city.  An undisclosed quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives were found with the six in Abu Eita.  The two sides exchanged gunfire, it said without elaborating. It made no mention of any security forces casualties.  The suspected fighters' bodies were taken to several hospitals in the city of Ismailia to be examined and identified, security and medical sources said.  Ongoing armed campaign in Sinai  The Sinai Peninsula has remained the epicentre of an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) offensive since 2013, when elected president Mohamed Morsi was overthrown in a military coup.  In February 2018, security forces launched a major operation against the local affiliate of ISIL, which has been mainly focused on volatile North Sinai province but has also targeted cells elsewhere in the country.  Egypt has often announced the killing of fighters during Operation Sinai 2018, but statements on significant losses by the security force have been rare.  On Saturday, the army reported that an attack on a checkpoint in North Sinai left 15 soldiers dead or wounded and seven of the suspected assailants killed.  Amnesty International has criticised the Egyptian army for using banned cluster bombs in their air raids on the area, describing them as the ""vilest weapons in modern warfare ... capable of killing and maiming civilians for years after their deployment"".",en,terrorattack,,

The death of 16 government-linked employees at a remote jungle work camp in early December, marked a dramatic escalation from decades of mostly sporadic skirmishes between poorly armed and disorganised guerrillas and a powerful Indonesian military.  Subsequent clashes prompted the Nduga district government to evacuate more than 400 students to Wamena, the capital of neighbouring Jayawijaya district, according to Humanitarian Volunteers for Nduga and a local education agency official.  ""Some of the students are suffering from trauma,"" said Ence Geong, a coordinator at the NGO, told Agence France-Presse.  ""When the military came to the school in uniforms, some of the students ran"" in fear.  Scores of other residents are believed to have fled to neighbouring districts or into the jungle amid allegations soldiers carried out arson, harassment and the killing of livestock and civilians, residents and activists said.  Local resident Sripona Nirigi told AFP her elderly father Gemin - a priest - was shot dead in December during a sweep of the area by the military.  Related Story Indonesia hunts suspects in alleged Papua mass killing  Related Story Governor of Indonesia's Papua calls for army to end hunt for rebels  His burned corpse was found by one of her siblings some two weeks later, she added. Her account could not be independently verified.  Papua military spokesman Colonel Muhammad Aidi rejected allegations the military had fired on civilians, calling it a ""hoax"".  ""If there are claims of civilian victims, they're definitely not ordinary civilians,"" Aidi told AFP.  ""They are part of the (separatists) that are attacking the military.""  Aidi said the army had investigated the alleged killing of the priest and denied he was shot by soldiers, saying it was still unclear whether he was alive or dead.  He added that two soldiers have been killed and several more were injured in clashes with rebels since the December massacre of workers who were building bridges and roads in Indonesia's most impoverished region.  The rebels claimed they were legitimate military targets.  Local commander Binsar Sianipar separately confirmed the students had been evacuated, but said it was due to a teacher shortage in the area, not the military presence.  Classes are being held in tents and the children are staying in overcrowded conditions at relatives' houses, Geong said. Some 80 teachers have joined them.  The military operations in Nduga have displaced at least one thousand people, according to lawyer and activist Veronica Koman.  ""Jakarta ordered the military operation, but has been doing nothing to assist... civilians (who are) now internally displaced persons,"" said Koman, who is in contact with church leaders and activists in Papua.  ""I've seen credible photos and videos of burnt livestock and houses, including a sick old man burnt inside a house.""  Indonesian security forces have long been accused of rights abuses against Papua's ethnic Melanesian population including extrajudicial killings of activists and arrest of peaceful protesters.  Papua, which shares a border with Papua New Guinea, just north of Australia, has been the site of low-level insurgency since the 1960s.  The former Dutch colony declared itself independent in 1961, but neighbouring Indonesia took control of Papua two years later on the condition it hold an independence referendum.  Jakarta annexed the mineral-rich region in 1969 with a UN-backed vote that is widely seen as a sham.",en,terrorattack,609,"['Papua', 'Top', 'Top', 'Top']"

REUTERS/Rodi Said  DEIR AL-ZOR, Syria (Reuters) - The last civilians are expected to be evacuated from Islamic StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final enclave in eastern Syria on Thursday, clearing the way for U.S.-backed forces to attack jihadists still holed up inside, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces said.  The village of Baghouz at the Iraqi border is the last scrap of territory left to Islamic State in the Euphrates valley region that became its final stronghold in Iraq and Syria after a series of defeats in 2017.  Taking it will nudge the eight-year-old Syrian war towards a new phase, with U.S. President Donald TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pledge to withdraw troops leaving a security vacuum that other powers could seek to fill.  The head of the SDF media office, Mustafa Bali, told Reuters the SDF would attack once the civilian evacuation of Baghouz was complete - a process he expected to be finished on Thursday.  Baghouz, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, is completely surrounded by the SDF.  Bali did not say how much more time was needed to finish off the remaining Islamic State militants, or give a fresh estimate of how many fighters remained.  Related Coverage Ten trucks transport IS fighters, families to Iraq - local mayor  The SDF has previously estimated several hundred fighters - believed mostly to be foreign jihadists - are still inside.  The U.S.-led coalition said on Wednesday Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most hardenedÃ¢â‚¬Â jihadists remain in Baghouz.  More than 2,000 civilians left the enclave on Wednesday, the SDF said.

FILE PHOTO: Islamic state members walk in the last besieged neighborhood in the village of Baghouz, Deir Al Zor province, Syria February 18, 2019. REUTERS/Rodi Said/File Photo  The young Tunisian-French woman was among truckloads of civilians leaving the militantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ last enclave in eastern Syria.  Like Ali, many were relatives of Islamic State fighters who have followed the group during years of retreat until it fell back to the village of Baghouz, now besieged by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).  Ã¢â‚¬Å“GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world is big. The most important thing is that I do not return to France or Tunisia,Ã¢â‚¬Â she told Reuters, saying life had been Ã¢â‚¬Å“impossibleÃ¢â‚¬Â for her in both places because of her decision to wear the full Islamic face veil, or niqab.  Accompanied only by her two young children at a checkpoint on the edge of Baghouz on Friday, Ali said she did not know what had happened to her Syrian husband from Latakia, an IS fighter who travelled with her to the village near the Iraqi border.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He is somewhere ... currently I truly donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ali, laughing faintly beneath her veil.  Ali and her children, a girl aged nearly three and a 18-month-old boy, were headed to the al-Hol camp in SDF-controlled northeast Syria.  The SDF has said it wants all civilians evacuated from Baghouz before it launches a final assault to defeat or force surrender on the remaining fighters. The U.S.-led coalition has described those left inside as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“most hardenedÃ¢â‚¬Â IS militants.  The SDF has not ruled out the possibility that some militants have crept out, hidden among the civilians. Warplanes flew overhead on Friday as the evacuation continued, but there was no sound of bombing or clashes.  ADVERSITY IN FINAL ENCLAVE  Ali, who entered Syria from Turkey, lived under IS rule in towns including Jarablus, which was captured by Turkish forces and their Syrian allies in 2016, and in the jihadistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ de facto capital at Raqqa, which was seized by the SDF in 2017.  She spoke fondly of the last spell living in adversity in the final IS enclave. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In Baghouz, especially in the last period, I learnt perhaps all the principles of life,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  It was the end point in a journey that started in Tunisia after the 2011 revolution that heralded the Arab uprisings, sweeping out the leaders of Libya, Egypt and Yemen, and presaging SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own eight-year war.  Under the ousted Tunisian leader Zine al-Abidin Ben Ali, there was a Ã¢â‚¬Å“very harsh constraint on MuslimsÃ¢â‚¬Â, she said. She herself had not been particularly pious at that point, but something changed when she saw veiled Libyan women who had come to Tunis after their own uprising.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I saw a woman wearing niqab, I was afraid as it was something strange in Tunis,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ali said. Adopting the dress herself, she then faced difficulties continuing her studies at the French institute in Tunis and, for several months, in Toulouse in France, where full face veils are banned.  Along with her mother, who went with her to Syria, Ali joined IS after being won over by one of its propaganda videos. She said she had been disowned by her brother who serves in the French army, which belongs to the coalition backing the SDF.  The gradual defeat of the militant groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“caliphateÃ¢â‚¬Â has rescued millions of people from draconian laws, harsh punishments and, for minorities, slaughter or sexual slavery.  Ali said she would meet at the camp with her mother, who had already quit Baghouz. Ã¢â‚¬Å“God will fix things for me,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said the Tokyo University team would receive up to US$31 million to advance the development and manufacturing of a shot for the bat-borne disease.  Nipah virus was first identified in 1999 during an outbreak of illness affecting pig farmers and others in close contact with pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. More than 100 people died in that outbreak, and about a million pigs were killed to try to halt its spread.  Nipah is transmitted to humans via direct contact with infected bats, infected pigs or other infected people.  At least 17 people were killed in an outbreak of Nipah in India last year in which 19 cases were reported - giving a case fatality rate of 90 per cent.  CEPI, which was set up at the start of 2017, aims to dramatically speed up the development of vaccines against new and unknown diseases - collectively known as Disease X.  ""There is an urgent need for accelerated research and development for the Nipah virus,"" Dr Richard Hatchett, CEPI's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""Not only is the case fatality rate for this disease high ... there is a serious risk (it) could become a threat to global health security.""

Johor Health, Environment and Agriculture Committee chairman Sahruddin Jamal said the children, aged four and below, were among 52 people who tested positive for the disease.  ""They (include)... the deceased's four-year-old sister, who also did not receive immunisation for diphtheria,"" he was quoted as saying by The Star news website yesterday.  The infected children, he said, have been placed in an isolation ward and are receiving medical care.  According to the World Health Organisation, no vaccine is 100 per cent effective and not all who are vaccinated develop immunity. But vaccinations significantly lower the risk of infection.  Malaysia has seen a rise in the number of children falling victim to contagious diseases in the last few years, and the health authorities worry that there are parents who reject immunisation programmes for fear that the vaccines used infringe strict religious rules. Though the Islamic authorities have waived the stringent halal requirement if suitable vaccines are not available, conservative Muslims sometimes reject innoculations over concerns that some vaccines may have the DNA of pigs, which Muslims are forbidden to consume.  Dr Sahruddin told The Star that four diphtheria cases had been reported in Johor since last October, including three children between 10 months and two years old.  ""Two of them died and all three were not vaccinated,"" he said, adding that some 7 per cent of children in Johor did not receive vaccinations despite counselling.  ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT The percentage of children getting their first doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines by their fifth birthday has reached our target but not for the vaccination given to children nine months old and above, which is now only at 89 per cent. DR LEE BOON CHYE, Malaysia's Deputy Health Minister, on the ministry's target of 95 per cent vaccination rate for effective control of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria and neonatal tetanus.  The state government, said Dr Sahruddin, supported the Health Ministry's proposal to make vaccination compulsory.  ""I am in full support of the proposal as there have been rare cases resurfacing in Johor such as diphtheria due to the refusal of certain parents to vaccinate their children"".  Symptoms of diphtheria include fever, sore throat, a thick covering at the back of the throat and swollen tonsils.  Meanwhile, Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad has said his ministry will table a proposal to make immunisation compulsory.  He was reported as saying by Bernama on Sunday: ""I believe there will be arguments for and against the proposal, and the Ministry of Health will consider all views seriously.""  Separately, Dr Dzulkefly's deputy, Dr Lee Boon Chye, said the vaccination rate for toddlers nine months old and above is only 89 per cent.

As ColombiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign minister warned about Ã¢â‚¬Å“credible threats to the lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â of VenezuelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.  The U.S. Treasury DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.  The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.  Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from MaduroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“henchmenÃ¢â‚¬Â to GuaidoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government-in-waiting.  He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s corrupt financial networks,Ã¢â‚¬Â Pence said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.Ã¢â‚¬Â  While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœCREDIBLE THREATSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  On a day that began with Guaido urging Ã¢â‚¬Å“all optionsÃ¢â‚¬Â to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.  Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“massacreÃ¢â‚¬Â of the weekend.  Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family. From BogotÃƒÂ¡, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,Ã¢â‚¬Â  At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.  In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.  Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as VenezuelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider Ã¢â‚¬Å“all optionsÃ¢â‚¬Â in ousting Maduro.  But the Lima Group said it Ã¢â‚¬Å“reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,Ã¢â‚¬Â the statement said.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who many nations have recognized as the country's rightful interim ruler, shake hands during a meeting of the Lima Group in Bogota, Colombia, February 25, 2019. REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez  CALL FOR AMNESTY  Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his Ã¢â‚¬Å“corruption and his brutalityÃ¢â‚¬Â will leave Venezuela peacefully.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We make clear to them that we will support the interim presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,Ã¢â‚¬Â Pence said.  Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.  Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other powers in embracing Guaido as VenezuelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rightful president.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,Ã¢â‚¬Â Pence said.  Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in VenezuelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.  Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup.  At least 167 members of MaduroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.  In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by MaduroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.  Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“trochasÃ¢â‚¬Â generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“trocheros.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Slideshow (3 Images)  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We were hungry when before the border closed.

We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what will happen if the border continues closed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider Ã¢â‚¬Å“the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas MaduroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta, Roberta Rampton, Helen Murphy and Julia Symmes Cobb; additional reporting by Mitra Taj in Lima, Aislinn Laing in Santiago, Lisandra Paraguassu in Brasilia, Mayela Armas and Anggy Polanco in Urena, and Shaylim Castro in Caracas; editing by Bill Trott and Grant McCool",en,terrorattack,617,['Venezuela']

Widespread malnutrition and low rates of immunization on the Indian Ocean island have ramped up the killing power of the highly infectious virus.  In the last 6 months, nearly 1,000 children have been killed by a resurgent disease that vaccination once appeared to have tamed.  Now on a drip, the scrawny infant was only saved because her mother Soa Robertine, 32, made the 25-kilometer (15-mile) trek from her home to the Anivorano-nord health center, in the island's far north.  Without her timely action, respiratory or neurological complications arising from the virus would have proved fatal, doctors said.  ""Frangeline is suffering severe malnutrition and she wasn't vaccinated against measles,"" said the clinic's head of medicine, Hollande Robisoa.  ""She contracted a complicated form of measles and she would have died if she hadn't been brought here.""  Many other children have not been so lucky.  Between last September and February, there were more than 79,000 cases of measles in Madagascar, 926 of which were fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  The Anivorano-nord clinic has had 510 patients suffering from ""kitrotro"" and ""kisaosy"" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the local names for measles.  Roughly 100 patients were hospitalized but only 4 lost their lives, according to official statistics.  But many local people dispute the numbers in a community where rumors are common.  ""I heard that hundreds of children have already died,"" said Sylvain Randriamaro, 46, sitting in the hospital waiting room.  ""I was alarmed, so I decided to vaccinate my two children,"" aged 5 and 6, he said.  Measles has hit Madagascar barely a year after it was gripped by an outbreak of plague that claimed 200 lives.  ""It's a major epidemic,"" said doctor Vincent Sodjinou, a WHO representative.  ""It's down to the fact that for almost a decade the rate of vaccine coverage was not high enough and, over generations, the numbers of unvaccinated people have increased.""  'Malnutrition a bed for measles'  Measles can be relatively benign if symptoms like fever and cough are handled promptly.  If not, there is a risk of ""opportunistic"" illness such as pneumonia or diarrhea Ã¢â‚¬â€œ diseases that can fatally attack patients with weak immune systems.  In Madagascar, where 47% of children under 5 are malnourished, the disease has proved particularly dangerous.  ""It's often said that malnutrition makes a bed for measles,"" said Sodjinou. ""The most serious cases are often reported in malnourished children.""  The pediatric ward at Antsiranana's military hospital, north of Anivorano, has been overwhelmed.  ""Normally we only treat one measles case here every two months,"" said head of medicine Ravohavy Setriny Mahatsangy. ""We've had 444 just since December.""  Mahatsangy blamed physical contact between patients, their ""reluctance to go to hospital, and opposition to vaccinations.""  The combination of factors has wrought a tragic toll on his patients.  One example is Marie Lydia Zafisoa, aged 8, whose ""mother took her to a witchdoctor...and then a traditional healer who prescribed 6 baths,"" according to her aunt Bana Tombo.  When that failed, Zafisoa's father carried her to the clinic.  ""It was too late Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she died on the way, on her father's shoulders,"" said Tombo.  Seven-month-old Adriano Luc Rakototsioharana was more fortunate.  Her grandmother Catherine had also turned to traditional medicine before taking her to hospital.  She barely survived the ordeal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but even so, Catherine remains adamant that traditional medicine holds the key.  ""For measles, you need a cow dung infusion or a tea with bark from the lazalaza tree,"" she said.  'It's the culture'  Doctors say that such beliefs are frustrating their efforts to roll back the disease.  ""It's the culture,"" Ravohavy said, with a resigned smile.  ""Changing people's mentality is far more difficult than treating measles.""  The profession also complains that the situation is worsening despite the state paying for most measles treatment.  ""But the people prefer traditional healers who often advise them to refuse any hospitalization,"" said a health ministry official, doctor Said Borohany.  ""And most villages are hours away from basic medical centers.""  The other viable solution, vaccinations, has been complicated by the lack of funds available for such a program.  Until now the nation's vaccination program has administered only a single dose when the WHO recommends two.  The United Nations agency estimates that 5.6 million doses would be needed to contain the epidemic.  But Madagascar is $1.6 million (1.42 million euros) short of the $11.2 million needed to fund such an operation.  Newly-elected President Andry Rajoelina has promised to vaccinate all children aged between 6 months and 9 years.  ""Our goal is to eradicate measles,"" he said.  But the fight will be long and difficult.  ""Madagascar put in place a routine vaccination program,"" said the WHO envoy, Sodjinou. ""But it remains inadequate to reach the furthest reaches of the country."" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,diseas,,

A bloody military crackdown in 2017 forced some 740,000 Rohingya Muslims over the border into Bangladesh in violence United Nations investigators have said warrants the prosecution of top generals for genocide and crimes against humanity.  But the armed forces are now waging a war against a militant group claiming to represent the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, a population that also stands accused of aiding soldiers in their expulsion of the Rohingya.  The Arakan Army (AA) has in recent months mounted several attacks on security forces and officials in its struggle for more autonomy and rights for Rakhine people.  The attack late Saturday took place in Yoetayoke village, just an hour north of Rakhine stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capital Sittwe.  Images seen by Agence France-Presse (AFP) showed bodies lying on the ground, covered in blankets with a pool of blood soaking into the dust in the grounds of the ramshackle police station.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nine police were killed, one was injured and another one is missing,Ã¢â‚¬Â a senior police officer told AFP, not wanting to be named.  A leaked police report said weapons were also taken from the police post.  No group has yet claimed responsibility and the AA could not immediately be reached for comment.  A local administrator confirmed investigations are underway.  Engulfed in conflict  Northern Rakhine state is inaccessible outside of carefully government-chaperoned trips and the information is difficult to verify independently.  But swathes of the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s north are once again engulfed in conflict.  The military has brought in thousands of reinforcements and is bombarding AA positions with heavy artillery.  Several thousand people have been forced from their homes by the violence.  Yet there is widespread support for the AAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cause across much of Rakhine, one of the poorest states in the country, where many feel they have suffered decades of discrimination by the state.  Some 100 local administrators submitted their resignation en masse this month calling for the release of four colleagues reportedly arrested for having links with the AA.  The verdict in a treason trial against a popular Rakhine politician is also expected in the coming days and could prove to be a further flashpoint.  Aye Maung stands accused of treason after allegedly inciting Rakhine people in a speech last year to take arms and rise up against the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethnic-Bamar (Burmese) majority.  The AA has expanded its ranks since its formation in 2009 and is now believed to have several thousand recruits.  The group ramped up operations at the end of last year, but it was a deadly attack on four police posts on Independence Day early January that focused the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention and triggered the militaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swift retaliation.  Thirteen police officers were killed in the brazen attack and in an unprecedented move, the civilian government instructed the military to crack down on the insurgents.  This came just a couple of weeks after the military declared a unilateral ceasefire against ethnic armed groups on the other side of Myanmar, allowing the army to concentrate its efforts in Rakhine.  Myanmar's restive borderlands have been plagued by conflict since independence from British colonial rule 70 years ago.  Violence in strife-torn Rakhine was glossed over by Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi at a recent investment forum where she touted the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ""untapped"" economic potential and blamed the international community for focusing ""narrowly"" on its problems.

A ragged tent encampment in the eastern Syrian village of Baghouz is all that remains of a once-sprawling ISIS ""caliphate"" declared in 2014 across large swaths of Syria and neighboring Iraq.  The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces have been trying to crush holdout ISIS fighters for weeks but the mass outpouring of men, women and children from the riverside hamlet has bogged down their advance.  Backed by the US-led coalition, the SDF renewed their assault on Sunday, March 10, after warning remaining ISIS fighters that the time for surrendering was up.  Airstrikes and shelling have pummelled Baghouz for two nights in a row, killing scores of fighters and prompting hundreds of jihadists and their relatives to surrender.  ""There was fierce fighting,"" Ali Cheir, an SDF unit commander, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) from a rudimentary outpost inside the village.  ""The objective of our advance is to terrorize ISIS fighters so they surrender, and for the civilians to come out,"" said the 27-year-old fighter.  The frontline was quiet Tuesday morning, hours after the airstrikes and rocket attacks on Monday, March 11, night engulfed the last ISIS pocket in flames.  The commander said the SDF had slowed its offensive after daybreak to allow for jihadists and their relatives to turn themselves in.  ""There are people handing themselves over now and we have completely halted fire so that they can surrender,"" he said.  Another SDF official who asked not to be named said that his force and the coalition only target ISIS positions at night.  'Target reached'  Beyond the frontline, warplanes were heard rumbling overhead, as the crackle of gunfire rang from the outskirts of the ISIS encampment.  On a hilltop overlooking the embattled village on Monday night, an AFP correspondent saw a blaze ravaging the riverside encampment.  SDF fighters launched several artillery shells from hundreds of meters (yards) away.  Rawan, an SDF fighter, tracked one of his shots as it whizzed past a field. ""Excellent... target reached,"" he rejoiced, as it hit a fence.  Coalition warplanes pounded the jihadist redoubt with 20 airstrikes, destroying armored vehicles and arms caches, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali said.  He said US-backed forces clashed with jihadists on several fronts, killing nearly 40 ISIS fighters.  Since December, almost 59,000 people have left the last ISIS redoubt, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around a tenth of them suspected jihadist fighters.  The United Nations said the numbers from Baghouz arriving in one Kurdish-run camp further north for the displaced were smaller than in previous weeks.  It said they were reaching the camp in a worse state than before.  The UN's food agency said it is concerned about their well-being.  ""On Sunday night more than 3,000 people, mostly women and children in a poor state, reached the camp, bringing the population there to over 65,000,"" the WFP said.  ""WFP is deeply concerned about the welfare of tens of thousands of people recently arriving at the Al-Hol camp,"" it said Tuesday.  Around 113 people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ two-thirds of them children under 5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have died en route to the camp or shortly after arriving since December, the UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA says.  'Battles are not over'  At the height of its brutal rule, ISIS controlled a stretch of land in Syria and Iraq the size of the United Kingdom.  The total capture of the Baghouz camp by the SDF would mark the end of the cross-border ""caliphate"" it proclaimed 5 years ago.  But beyond Baghouz, ISIS retains a presence in eastern Syria's vast Badia desert and sleeper cells in the northeast.  The jihadists have continued to claim deadly attacks in SDF-held territory in recent months, and the US military has warned of the need to maintain a ""vigilant offensive.""  The group released a video late Monday allegedly showing jihadists in Baghouz, quietly defiant in the face of the advancing SDF.  ""If we had thousands of kilometers and now we only have some kilometers left, it is said we have lost Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but God's judging standard is different,"" said a man named Abu Abdel Adheem.  ""The battles are not over,"" he said, sitting on the ground in a circle with two men and a young boy in a hooded jacket.  Baghouz is the latest front on Syria's complex civil war, which enters its ninth year this month.  Syria's war has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions since the conflict erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

Islamic State's territorial defeat in Syria marks a critical moment for Kurdish forces who partnered with Washington to fight the militants. They now hope Western military allies will lend them political support.  Advertisement  Victory over Islamic State at Baghouz, a shred of land at the Iraqi border, will herald ""a new phase"", said Badran Jia Kurd, advisor to the Kurdish-led administration running north and east Syria.  ""There will be efforts and a struggle to gain political legitimacy for this administration ... and towards finding a peaceful solution"" to the Syrian conflict, he told Reuters during an interview in Qamishli.  The main Kurdish parties and their allies hold nearly a quarter of the country - the biggest chunk outside the hands of President Bashar al-Assad's government.  Their control is underpinned by a large military force, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which the Kurdish YPG militia spearheads.  Advertisement  Advertisement  But while the SDF has developed close ties with the United States, Washington has balked at extending political recognition to the authorities seeking autonomous rule.  The West has trodden carefully largely because of the concerns of Turkey, which sees the YPG as part of the outlawed Kurdish PKK movement that has waged an insurgency on Turkish soil for decades.  Just three months ago, Kurdish authorities were thrown into crisis when President Donald Trump abruptly announced his decision to withdraw US forces.  Washington has since partially reversed course, and now plans to leave 200 troops in northeast Syria along with about 800 to 1,500 troops from European allies.  Trump's move drove the Kurdish-led administration to seek fresh talks with Assad via his key ally Russia. They hope for a political deal that would safeguard their autonomy and shield their region from Turkish attack.  LEFT OUT  Millions of Kurds live in territory straddling Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria. In Iraq, they govern an autonomous region.  Kurdish leaders have consistently been left out of UN efforts towards ending Syria's eight-year war. They have always insisted their aim is regional autonomy within a federal Syria, not independence. The West's reluctance to engage politically with them remains a deep source of frustration.  ""Honestly, until now, no clear, positive stance has taken shape ... even from the actual partners that we fought side by side with,"" Jia Kurd said.  Diplomatic efforts would focus on deepening relations with European allies, the United States and other countries in the coalition that has been fighting Islamic State, he said.  He added that foreign states need to help rebuild infrastructure and revive the economy to prevent an Islamic State resurgence or invasion by hostile forces - an apparent reference to Turkey.  Jia Kurd said nascent contacts with Damascus had stalled and accused the Syrian government of a refusal to negotiate.  In a speech last month, Assad warned Kurdish fighters not to rely on Washington and said only the state could protect them.  Assad, now controlling most of the country with Russia and Iran's help, has pledged to recover every inch.  Jia Kurd said the rhetoric had killed hopes for dialogue and could lead to ""a dangerous and catastrophic direction"" towards conflict that the administration in the north does not want.",en,terrorattack,619,"['State', 'State']"

Mudasir Ahmed Khan, who was shot dead Sunday, was described by authorities as a top commander with Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the militant group behind the deadly February 14 bombing in Indian-administered Kashmir.  That attack on a convoy of Indian paramilitaries in its portion of Kashmir was the deadliest in decades, and provoked a retaliatory airstrike against what New Delhi called a JeM training camp on Pakistani soil.  Pakistan, which denied supporting JeM, responded by shooting down an Indian warplane and capturing the pilot, whose return two days later pulled the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink.  Police in Kashmir said Monday that an investigation had Ã¢â‚¬Å“revealed that Mudasir was one of the key conspiratorsÃ¢â‚¬Â of the deadly attack on Indian forces.  Mudasir was shot in Tral Ã¢â‚¬â€ a town in Pulwama district where the suicide bombers struck Ã¢â‚¬â€ along with another gunman Indian police said was from Pakistan.  K.J.S. Dhillon, the local army commander in Kashmir, said Monday that 14 alleged JeM militants, including six commanders, had been eliminated in a crackdown in the aftermath of the bombing.  Police said the mastermind of the convoy attack was killed on February 18 along with two other JeM associates in a shootout in Kashmir.  The disputed region is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, and the foes have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory.  Resistance to Indian rule in the Muslim-majority region has spiked in recent years, with public demonstrations turning violent and soldiers pelted with stones in clashes that have seen civilians killed.  Kashmir has been ruled directly by New Delhi since June last year when Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruling party pulled out of an alliance governing the restive territory.  Local parties had been advocating for a fresh state ballot, but the election commissioner said at the weekend no such poll was scheduled in the near future.  Rebel groups seeking independence for Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan have been waging an insurgency against half a million Indian troops stationed there for 30 years.  Tens of thousands have died in the fighting, mostly civilians.    ",en,terrorattack,,

Before entering the Raul Brasil school in Suzano near Sao Paulo, the former pupils aged 17 and 25 shot and killed the younger assailantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncle, who owned a car rental agency where they stole a vehicle.  Ten people, including the two attackers, were killed in total, Sao Paulo police said. The students who died were boys mostly 15 and 16 years old.  Police identified the assailants as Guilherme Taucci Monteiro, 17, and Luiz Henrique de Castro, 25. The 17-year-old was the leader and main planner, an investigator said.  Another 10 people, mostly school children, were shot and injured, with several in serious condition, said police.  An amateur video aired by Globo TV showed children screaming, running and begging for their lives as loud shots were heard.  Children climbed and jumped over a wall that surrounds the school building, then sprinted down streets, screaming for help, security-camera footage from homes nearby showed.  Marilene GonÃƒÂ§alves, a 51-year-old housewife who lives near the school, went outside when she heard gunshots and screams. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I opened the gate to my house, and I saw children jumping over the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wall,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  Marcelo Salles, commander of police forces in Sao Paulo state, said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was an unspeakably brutal crime.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The two assailants spent more than a year planning their attack, which they Ã¢â‚¬Å“hoped would draw more attention than the Columbine massacre,Ã¢â‚¬Â an investigator said on condition of anonymity. In the 1999 attack on Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, two students killed 13 people.  A motive was not yet clear. The school is in a middle-class neighbourhood and has about 1,000 students aged 11 to 16. One teacher told police that the younger attacker had been bullied while he was a student there.  A student reacts while paying tribute to victims of the shooting in the Raul Brasil school in Suzano, Sao Paulo state, Brazil March 13, 2019. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino  School shootings are rare in Brazil, although the country is one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most violent with more annual homicides than any other. The last major school shooting was in 2011, when 12 children were shot dead by a former pupil in Rio de Janeiro.  Gun laws are extremely strict in Brazil, but it is not difficult to illegally purchase a weapon. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro made relaxing gun control a cornerstone of his campaign last year.  WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shooting ignited debate among political leaders, with some saying armed teachers could have prevented the killings, while others said putting more guns on Brazilian streets will only lead to more deaths.  PACT TO DIE TOGETHER  Security camera footage from the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entrance published on the website of O Globo newspaper showed Monteiro entering the school around 9:30 a.m. He immediately pulled a pistol out of his jeans and shot into a group of eight students, hitting at least two, who dropped to the floor.  Castro entered the school a few seconds later and put a crossbow and backpack on the floor. He then pulled out a hatchet and hacked at the bodies on the ground.  Students flooded into the entrance foyer, running into Monteiro. He grabbed one girl by the hair and punched her several times in the face.  She managed to escape, and students frantically scrambled out of the school.  GonÃƒÂ§alves, the housewife who lives nearby, gave safe harbour to several students, including one boy who was shot in the jaw.  The wounded student could not speak. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I put my cell phone into his hand and he typed, with his dirty hands trembling, that he wanted me to call his mom,Ã¢â‚¬Â GonÃƒÂ§alves said.  Salles said the gunmen used at least one .38 caliber pistol and speed loaders, along with a crossbow, knives, a compound bow and arrow and several Molotov cocktails.  Slideshow (14 Images)  Police arrived eight minutes after the shooting started, and the attackers were already dead, Salles said. Investigators said they had a pact to die together in the attack although Globo TV, citing police, reported that Monteiro killed Castro, and then turned the pistol on himself.  Crime scene photographs released by police show Monteiro, his head lying in a pool of blood, dressed in black with a machete tucked in his pants. CastroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body lay near MonteiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, with the crossbow on the ground between the pair.

The evidence was insufficient to charge 16 other former soldiers, Northern IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Public Prosecution Service said on Thursday.  Soldiers from the elite Parachute Regiment opened fire on Sunday, Jan. 30, 1972, during an unauthorised march in the Bogside, a nationalist area of Londonderry. They killed 13 people and wounded 14 others, one of whom died later.  A judicial inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, which took place at the height of Northern IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 30-year sectarian conflict, said in 2010 the victims were innocent and had posed no threat to the military.  It was the worst single shooting incident of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The TroublesÃ¢â‚¬Â, although several bomb attacks by rival militant groups claimed higher death tolls, and ThursdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision reignites the controversy.  The prosecutor announced on Thursday that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soldier FÃ¢â‚¬Â for the murder of James Wray and William McKinney and for the attempted murders of Joseph Friel, Michael Quinn, Joe Mahon and Patrick OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Donnell.  But Ã¢â‚¬Å“in respect of the other 18 suspects, including 16 former soldiers and two alleged Official IRA members, it has been concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction,Ã¢â‚¬Â a prosecutorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statement said.  Related Coverage UK will legally support ex-soldier charged over ""Bloody Sunday"" killing  VictimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s families said they were disappointed by the decision. Their lawyers said they would challenge in the High Court any prosecutorial decision that did not withstand scrutiny.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We would like to remind everyone that no prosecution or if it comes to it no conviction does not mean not guilty, it does not mean that no crime was committed, it does not mean that those soldiers acted in a dignified and appropriate way,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mickey McKinney, brother to one of the victims, told a news conference.  Before a prosecutorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s service briefing at a Londonderry hotel, the families marched from the Bogside and sang civil rights anthem Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Shall OvercomeÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Linda Nash, the brother of William Nash, a 19-year-old killed on the day, was tearful when she emerged from the hotel. Veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands shook as he comforted her.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“MASSACRE OF INNOCENTSÃ¢â‚¬Â  Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, Stephen Herron said he was conscious relatives faced an Ã¢â‚¬Å“extremely difficult day.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“However, much of the material which was available for consideration by the Inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings, due to strict rules of evidence that apply,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Families of the victims walk through the Bogside before the announcement of the decision whether to charge soldiers involved in the Bloody Sunday events, in Londonderry, Northern Ireland March 14, 2019. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne  The British government said it would provide full legal support to the soldier who will face prosecution. No other details were released by prosecutors of the identity of the man, who would be at least in his 60s.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The welfare of our former service personnel is of the utmost importance,Ã¢â‚¬Â Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said in a statement. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our serving and former personnel cannot live in constant fear of prosecution.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said it was important that no one said anything to prejudice the process following ThursdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision, adding that his thoughts were with all of the families.  The Saville Report, which was published in 2010 after a 12-year inquiry by High Court Judge Lord Saville, reversed the findings of a hastily-convened inquiry from 1972 by another judge, Lord Widgery, who concluded the soldiers only fired after being fired upon.  The Bloody Sunday killings caused widespread anger at the time - not least in the United States, where support for the Irish Republican cause runs high - and nearly 50 years later the incident remains highly emotive.  Supporters of the paratroopers say they were acting under extremely confused and stressful conditions, and it is unfair to pursue them so long after the event when many suspected Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombers and gunmen have been told they will no longer face arrest under the 1998 peace accords.  VictimsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ families and other voices say they must nonetheless be held to account for their actions.  The Saville Report said the paratroopers opened fire without warning and that none of the casualties has posed a threat.  Slideshow (15 Images)  The 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought a close to a conflict in which about 3,500 people were killed. British troops subsequently withdrew from the province, but tensions still persist and a car bomb exploded outside LondonderryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main courthouse in January. No one was injured.  The decision to prosecute came a week after BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minister for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, was forced to apologise for saying that killings by British soldiers and police were Ã¢â‚¬Å“not crimesÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA who are now the largest nationalist party in the province, said they shared the familiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ disappointment and Ã¢â‚¬Å“sense of incredulityÃ¢â‚¬Â at the decision.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The decision to prosecute just one ex-soldier does not change the fact that Bloody Sunday was a massacre of innocents,Ã¢â‚¬Â Sinn FeinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Northern Ireland leader Michelle OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill said in a statement.

We found various types of switching: (to detonate the bombs by) movement, step-on, and remote device,"" Brigadier-General Dedi told a media briefing yesterday morning.  He did not elaborate on how the land-mine bomb was activated.  ""The amount of explosives is quite high, meaning this required big enough financing. Our investigation is zooming in on who their financiers are,"" Brig-Gen Dedi added.  He said the couple had been planning a one-person attack strategy and a suicide bombing, indicated by a vest bomb that the police found in the house of Husain's accomplice, Ameng.  Part of Ameng's role was also to help finance the cell's operations, Brig-Gen Dedi said, pointing out that Ameng contributed 15 million rupiah (S$1,400).  Husain, Ameng and Ogel, the third person arrested in Sibolga, are believed to be members of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, an Indonesian terror group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  Separately, North Sumatra Police Chief Inspector-General Agus Andrianto said the woman who blew herself up was called Solimah.  Indonesian state news agency Antara reported that her body parts were found around 70m from the house that was besieged by police on Tuesday.  Neighbours of Husain said they noticed that he and his wife never went to a community mosque for prayer. They also understood that the couple had stricter views about Islam compared with other residents who practise a moderate form of the religion.  But neither Husain nor his wife had ever raised suspicion of terror activity, according to a report prepared by Jakarta-based Centre of Terrorism and Radicalism Studies (CTRS), whose researchers spoke to the couple's neighbours.  Originally from Sibolga, the self-trained electrician would help neighbours fix ceiling lights and replace wall light switches for a fee.  Husain and his wife had been away for years and came back to their home town only several years ago, local cleric Zainun told CTRS.  Husain's wife previously wore a burqa, but no longer did after they returned to Sibolga and lived in the house that was besieged by police on Tuesday, Mr Zainun said.  Yesterday, police said the couple had four children, identified by their initials: H aged 18, A aged 16, S aged 11, and H aged two. Police are now searching for the elder three. The youngest was killed in Wednesday's early morning blast.  Indonesian police began a major crackdown on militant networks early last year ahead of the Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang, South Sumatra, in August and September, as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings in Bali in October.  Figures show that Detachment 88 forces killed or detained 396 militants last year, a record number and a sharp jump from the 176 in 2017. Twenty-five suspects were gunned down during raids last year as they resisted arrest, nine more than in 2017.  Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, has long struggled with Islamic militancy.  A gun and suicide bomb attack in Jakarta in January 2016 left four attackers and four civilians dead. It was the first assault claimed by ISIS in South-east Asia.  Indonesia suffered its worst terrorist attack in 2002, when the bombings of two nightclubs on the resort island of Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists.",en,terrorattack,620,"['Top', 'Top', 'Top']"

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of sources across the country, said more than 21,000 children and 13,000 women were among the dead.  The conflict flared after unprecedented anti-government protests in the southern city of Daraa on March 15, 2011.  Demonstrations spread across Syria and were brutally suppressed by the regime, triggering a multi-front armed conflict that has drawn in foreign powers and militant groups.  The Britain-based ObservatoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last casualty toll on the Syrian conflict, issued in September, stood at more than 360,000 dead.  Over 125,000 Syrian government soldiers and pro-regime fighters figured in the latest toll, the monitoring group said.  It said other fighters, including rebels and Kurds, accounted for 67,000 of those killed.  Almost 66,000 were jihadists, mainly from the Islamist State (IS) group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), dominated by Al-QaedaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former affiliate in Syria.  The devastating conflict has displaced or sent into exile around 13 million Syrians, causing billions of dollars-worth of destruction.  With the support of powerful allies Russia and Iran, President Bashar al-Assad has won his war for political survival but his country is fractured and cash-strapped.  Having reversed rebel gains with a massive Russian intervention, Assad now controls almost two-thirds of SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s territory.  But key areas remain beyond regime control, including a swathe of the oil-rich northeast held by Kurdish-led fighters.  Washington backs the Syrian Democratic Forces, which are spearheading an anti-IS campaign, which is drawing to a close near the Iraqi border.  Idlib in northwestern Syria, held by HTS, is protected by a ceasefire deal between Ankara and Moscow which has seen Turkish troops deployed to the area.  SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conflict is estimated to have set its economy back three decades, destroying infrastructure and paralysing the production of electricity and oil.  Assad, however, has regained control of key commercial arteries and started a tentative comeback on the Arab diplomatic scene.  Several countries have called for Syria to be reintegrated into the Arab League, from which it was suspended as the death toll from the uprising mounted in 2011.    ",en,terrorattack,619,['Syria']

Gunfire broke out in two mosques in Christchurch during Friday prayers on what the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described as ""one of New Zealand's darkest days"".  ""From what we know, it does appear to have been well-planned. Two explosive devices attached to suspects' vehicles have been found and disarmed,"" she said.  The government raised the security threat to its highest level and all mosques in the country were asked to close. Police said four people - three men and one woman - had been detained. One was later released. None of them was known to the authorities.  New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush said one man in his late 20s is to be charged with murder. He will appear in court today.  The attackers targeted the Al Noor and Linwood mosques in central Christchurch, a city of nearly 400,000 people. Within minutes of the gunman opening fire at Al Noor Mosque at around 1.45pm local time (8.45am Singapore time), police secured the area, closing shops and businesses. Schools across the city were placed on lockdown as ambulances ferried the dead and injured to Christchurch Hospital.  HEINOUS ACT, SAYS SINGAPORE Singapore strongly condemns this vicious and mindless act of terror. This heinous act is an attempt to spread fear and hatred. We must not allow such acts to divide our societies. Singapore stands in solidarity with New Zealand in the fight against terrorism. PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG, in a letter to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.  A video purportedly showed the assault on the Al Noor Mosque, live-streamed by one of the attackers. He was named in media reports as 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant.  The live-streaming began as he drove to the mosque, parking his car in a nearby driveway. The beige station wagon contained a cache of weapons and ammunition in the front seat and boot, along with petrol canisters, reports said.  The video showed him going into the mosque twice and shooting at worshippers, including women and children, and then firing at others in the street.  Witnesses spoke of panic and horror as worshippers fled, while others were shot dead inside, bodies piled on top of one another. At least 20 people were also injured.  ""I could hear screaming and crying. I saw some people drop dead, some people were running away,"" a man in a wheelchair who was at Al Noor Mosque told TVNZ.  The attack triggered widespread condemnation. Singapore President Halimah Yacob wrote to Dame Patsy Reddy, the Governor-General of New Zealand, to convey condolences. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a letter to Ms Ardern: ""This heinous act is an attempt to spread fear and hatred. We must not allow such acts to divide our societies.""  So far, no Singaporeans are known to have been injured, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.  Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, Britain and many others voiced outrage, with the United States calling the attacks a ""vicious act of hate"".  Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said six Indonesians were inside the Al Noor Mosque when the shootings occurred. Three were unaccounted for. Two were injured at the other mosque. Malaysia said two of its citizens were wounded in the attacks.  In Australia, flags flew at half-mast. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said one of the attackers was Australia-born, and the authorities were studying any links between the country and the attacks.

2635782,cnn,Analysis Stephen Collinson Cnn,Trump again punts on white supremacy after New Zealand attacks,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/16/politics/donald-trump-new-zealand-white-supremacy-muslims/index.html,16/3/2019 0:00,16/3/2019 18:48,"(CNN) Once again, President Donald Trump is having a tough time calling out far right-wing white nationalism.  His response to the carnage in New Zealand, where 49 people died in an attack on two mosques, is also raising fresh questions about his attitude toward Islam following a long history of anti-Muslim rhetoric -- and about the extent to which the President has a responsibility to moderate his language given the rise in white supremacy movements across the world.  On Twitter and in remarks in the Oval Office, Trump was clear in condemning the killings. But he did not deliver a message of empathy and support to American Muslims, who may feel scared as security is stepped up at US mosques.  ""I spoke with Prime Minister Ardern of New Zealand to express the sorrow of our entire nation following the monstrous terror attacks at two mosques,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon after first condemning the attack as ""a horrible massacre in the Mosques"" on Twitter.  ""These sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing,"" the President said. ""We've all seen what went on. It's a horrible, horrible thing.""  But asked whether he saw a worrying rise in white supremacy movements around the world, Trump said he did not, blaming a small group of people ""with very, very serious problems."" He also told reporters that he had not seen the manifesto linked to by a social media account that's believed to belong to one of the attackers, which mentioned Trump by name and saw him as a symbol of renewed white identity.  While the President did not reach out to Muslims around the world, his daughter offered the kind of language that might have been expected from a more conventional commander in chief.  ""We join New Zealand and Muslim communities around the world in condemnation of this evil as we pray for the families of each victim and grieve together, "" Ivanka Trump tweeted on Friday morning.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the Christchurch killings a ""vicious attack of hate,"" though she did not specifically mention that the attack was against Muslims.  Trump's failure to do more to point out that the worshipers who died in Christchurch were Muslim represents a double standard, given that he has been much clearer in ascribing a religious motivation to other killings.  was to blame for a rise in hate crimes. Last year, after an attack on a Jewish temple in Pittsburgh, Trump spoke of an ""anti-Semitic"" motive in the attack, which itself sparked a debate over whether his inflammatory rhetoricwas to blame for a rise in hate crimes.  Trump has often been quick to wade in when a Muslim extremist has been a perpetrator of an attack and Muslims are not the victims, or to use such attacks to further his political arguments.  ""Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way!"" Trump, for instance, tweeted in March 2016.  And when he was running for office, he excoriated Democrats as dishonest about the motivation of Muslim extremists who conducted terror attacks.  ""These are radical Islamic terrorists, and she won't even mention the word, and nor will President Obama,"" Trump said at a presidential debate, referring to Hillary Clinton. ""Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is, or at least say the name.""  Equivocation on white nationalism  Trump has many times been accused of using rhetoric that emboldens extremists and dehumanizes his targets. He has used vulgar language to criticize NFL stars who took a knee during the National Anthem. In announcing his campaign, he said Mexico was sending ""rapists"" across the border into the US. On Friday, at the same event in which he bemoaned the attack in New Zealand, he warned of ""invasions"" of undocumented migrants coming across the southern border.  And Friday was not the first time that Trump has sought to downplay the threat of white nationalism.  Trump's moral leadership also came into question when he initially equivocated after he was endorsed by white supremacist David Duke during the 2016 campaign.  The President's comment Friday that white nationalism is not a growing problem contrasted with the vehemence with which other world leaders reacted, and their clear condemnations of white supremacist rhetoric and ideology.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May said there was no place in society for ""the vile ideology that drives and incites hatred and fear.""  Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison condemned a ""violent, extremist, right-wing terrorist attack.""  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the alleged perpetrator of the attack had ""extremist views that have absolutely no place in New Zealand and in fact, have no place in the world.""  In a tweet that posted before Trump's comments in the Oval Office, Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden -- a possible White House candidate in 2020 -- appeared to have Trump on his mind.  ""Whether it is antisemitism in Pittsburgh, racism in Charlottesville, or the xenophobia and Islamophobia today in Christchurch, violent hate is on the march at home and abroad. We cannot stand by as mosques are turned into murder scenes,"" Biden tweeted.  ""Silence is complicity,"" he added. ""Our children are listening. The time to speak out is now.""  Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas condemned Trump for what he styled as extremist rhetoric.  ""There is a cost to that. And the cost is part of what we saw today. There are people out there who are unstable that will be inspired by that and take action,"" Castro told Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""  White House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp told reporters Friday that it was ""outrageous to even make that connection between this deranged individual that committed this evil crime to the President, who has repeatedly condemned bigotry, racism.""  Trump's dismissal of the idea that white nationalism is on the rise contradicted warnings of his own government, and it was a characteristic example of how he ignores statistics that do not suit his political arguments.  In a May 2017 intelligence bulletin obtained by Foreign Policy magazine, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned of ""lethal violence"" from white supremacist extremist groups.  Trump's view also does not take into account the rise of white nationalist groups in politics in Europe, which has seen large marches in some cities.",en,terrorattack,620,['Zealand']

A right-wing supporter armed with semiautomatic weapons rampaged through two mosques in the city of Christchurch during afternoon prayers on Friday, killing 49 worshippers and wounding dozens more.  A visitor believed to be a 28-year-old Australian - who has been arrested and charged with murder in New Zealand - ""visited Turkey several times and stayed for a long period in the country"", the Turkish official said without giving dates.  ""We think that the suspect could have been to other countries (from Turkey) in Europe, Asia and Africa. We are investigating the suspect's movements and contacts in the countries,"" added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Turkish media reported that a manifesto published online allegedly by the attacker contained specific references to Turkey and ridding the famed Hagia Sophia in Istanbul of its minarets. Now a museum, the building was once a church before being turned into a mosque during the Ottoman empire.  Sofia earlier said it was investigating after discovering that the gunman might have visited Bulgaria in November 2018.  A man believed to be him spent a week in the country supposedly to ""visit historical sites and study the history of the Balkan country"", Bulgaria's chief prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said.  He said the inquiry would establish if this was ""correct or if he had other objectives"".  The same man also made a short visit to the Balkans in December 2016, travelling by bus across Serbia,  Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  'Growing hostility'  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday condemned the deadly attack, saying it illustrated the growing hostility towards Islam ""idly"" watched by the world.  ""With this attack, hostility towards Islam, that the world has been idly watching and even encouraging for some time, has gone beyond individual harassment to reach the level of mass killing,"" Erdogan said at the funeral of a former Turkish minister.  ""It is clear that the understanding represented by the killer that also targets our country, our people and myself, has started to take over Western societies like a cancer,"" Erdogan said.  The Turkish leader, who often criticises Islamophobic attitudes, called for the West to act to prevent similar attacks.  ""If measures are not taken right away, news of other disasters will follow this one... I am calling on the world, in particular the West, to take quick measures,"" he said.  After Friday prayers, dozens of people gathered outside Istanbul's Fatih Mosque - one of the city's main mosques - chanting condemnation of the attack and waving signs saying ""Stop global terrorism"" and ""Crusader Savagery in New Zealand"".  Erdogan had earlier condemned the attack on Twitter: ""May Allah have mercy on the victims and grant a speedy recovery to the wounded.""  Speaking in Brussels, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also condemned the killing, blaming ""irresponsible politicians who incite hatred against Muslims and propagate xenophobia"".  ""There are lessons that everybody needs to learn from this attack, especially in the EU, in the members of the EU,"" he said after meeting with European Union officials.  ""Hate language used against the Muslims should not be considered as a part of freedom of expression.""",en,terrorattack,620,"['Turkey', 'Zealand']"

He did not request bail and was remanded in custody until an April 5 court appearance. (READ: New Zealand mosque attacks: What we know)  Outside the courtroom, Christchurch residents struggled to deal with the aftermath of what is thought to be the worst act of terror against Muslims in the West.  Nearby, excavators were called in to remove the vast amount of earth needed to bury the dead, although police have not yet released the bodies to anxious families.  In a nearby hospital, doctors worked round the clock to treat 39 people for gunshot wounds and other injuries sustained in the attacks.  The wounded included a two-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, who was in critical condition.  The attack on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques has prompted an outpouring of grief and deep shock in this usually peaceful country, which prides itself on welcoming refugees fleeing violence or persecution.  Throughout the day people laid flowers at a makeshift memorial just beyond the police cordon around the Al Noor mosque, where most of the victims died.  Many offerings were accompanied by handwritten letters laden with sadness and disbelief, from residents of what one local driver called the ""city of sorrow"".  ""I am so sorry that you were not safe here. Our hearts are breaking for your loss,"" read one of the notes.  When the police tape was lifted late Saturday, bystanders spontaneously joined police in moving the stack of bouquets closer to the mosque.  An imam who was leading prayers at the Linwood mosque at the time of the attack said the Muslim community would not be shaken by the massacre.  ""It was a very bad day, not just all of us, all of New Zealand,"" said Ibrahim AbdulHalim. But, he added: ""We still love this country"".  Across New Zealand, Kiwis responded with interfaith solidarity -- crowdfunding millions of dollars, donating halal food and even offering to accompany local Muslims now scared to walk the streets.  Muslims make up just one percent of New Zealand's population.  'I am with you'  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern arrived in the city and, wearing a black headscarf, met with survivors and victims' families.  Ardern said the victims came from across the Muslim world, with Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia among the countries rendering consular assistance.  At least one Saudi citizen, four Jordanians and six Pakistanis were among the dead.  Sahra Ahmed, a New Zealander of Somali origin, said she was touched by the PM's gesture.  ""It means a lot. It is a signal to say Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I am with you,"" she told Agence France-Presse.  Police are now trying to piece together answers to the difficult questions of why and how this happened.  They want to know how it was possible for the perpetrator to remain undetected by the intelligence services despite his extremist views.  Ardern said the shooter was ""in possession of a gun license"" obtained in November 2017, and he started legally purchasing two semi-automatic weapons, reportedly AR-15s, two shotguns and a lever-action gun the following month.  Ardern said some of the guns had been modified to make them deadlier.  ""I can tell you one thing right now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ our gun laws will change,"" she said.  The suspect documented his radicalization and two years of preparations in a lengthy, meandering and conspiracy-filled far-right ""manifesto"".  He livestreamed footage of himself going room-to-room, victim to victim, shooting the wounded from close range as they struggled to crawl away in the main Christchurch mosque.  Thirty-six minutes after the police received the first call, Tarrant was in custody.  Commissioner Mike Bush hailed the ""absolute bravery"" of both police and members of the public ""who put themselves in harm's way"" to apprehend the suspect.  ""Their intervention may very likely have saved further lives.""  Two other people remain in custody, although their link to the attack is not clear. One man, 18-year-old Daniel Burrough, has been charged with incitement.  'Horrible massacre'  Revulsion at the attack, and tributes to the victims poured in from around the world, including from Pope Francis and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.  US President Donald Trump condemned the ""horrible massacre"" in which ""innocent people have so senselessly died"", but denied that the problem of right-wing extremism was widespread.  Australian police said they had visited Tarrant's childhood home in the town of Grafton, north of Sydney, and spoken to family members as part of their investigation.  The attack has prompted searching questions about whether right-wing extremism has been treated with enough seriousness by Western governments.  Ali Soufan, a former high-ranking FBI counter-terrorism agent, warned the West was ""in the midst of a surge of right-wing terrorism that has been metastasizing in plain sight while generating only a muted response from domestic counter-terrorism authorities"".  Ardern said she ""asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response"".

Brenton Tarrant, handcuffed and wearing a white prison suit, appeared in court on Saturday morning, a day after the usually peaceful nation suffered its deadliest terror attack.  He stood silently in the Christchurch District Court, smirking when media photographed him in the dock where he was flanked by two police officers.  He appeared to be making a gesture with his hands which has been interpreted by some as a white supremacist sign, while others believe it is a reference to an online joke.  During a brief hearing at Christchurch District Court, Tarrant was remanded without a plea. He is due back in court on 5 April and police said he was likely to face further charges.  PM: Suspect intended to continue with attack  Tarrant is accused of murdering a man, whose name was suppressed by Judge Paul Kellar on the grounds of undue hardship to his family.  The death toll at the al Noor and Linwood mosques was initially 49 but as New Zealand woke up on Sunday Police Commissioner Mike Bush said a 50th victim had been found at one of the mosques.  Some 36 people remain in hospital and two of them are in a critical condition. A child was transferred to Starship, a children's hospital in Auckland, where she remains.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the terror attacks marked ""one of New Zealand's darkest days"". She promised that gun laws would be changed.  The mayor of Christchurch in New Zealand said the shootings were an ""act of cowardice"" and the attacker came with ""hate in his heart"".  Mayor Lianne Dalziel said: ""He did not develop his hatred here. He came here to perform this act of terrorism.""  She said graves were being dug for the dozens of worshippers who were shot dead and officials are working closely with the community on the specific requirements of a large number of Muslim funerals.  The mayor added: ""At this time there will be a grief stricken city, but we will come back from this and continue our path of welcoming people of all nations, from all religions from all cultures to our city.""

Scrawled on the arsenal of weapons used in the attack were the dates of historic Christian battles and the men who fought in them, names of well-known far right extremists and phrases, including ""here's your migration compact!"" - an apparent reference to the Global Compact for Migration, an agreement for safe and orderly migration.  Neo-Nazi symbols were attached to an armoured vest.  Still images show mosque gunman's preparation  On Saturday Ms Ardern said two other firearms were found in the gunman's vehicle, adding it was ""his intention to continue with his attack"".

The pair noticed Tarrant had left the spent rifle on the ground as he returned towards his car.  So Lateef's unnamed fellow worshipper seized the initiative and grabbed the rifle, following the attacker to his car and using it to smash the vehicle's back window before running away.  The pair's actions may have saved further casualties, as Tarrant was apprehended by two armed police officers not far from Linwood mosque soon afterwards while driving his car with a visibly smashed back window.  Tarrant used Facebook to live broadcast his initial assault on the Noor Mosque, where at least 40 worshippers were murdered and dozens more wounded.  In that opening attack, footage from his broadcast showed Tarrant mercilessly spraying bullets inside the mosque and then returning to his car to fetch a new rifle.  He then walked back inside and started shooting again.  Footage from the attack also shows at least one worshipper at the Noor Mosque who was gunned down while trying to charge Tarrant during his rampage.  Lateef was photographed soon after the attack by local media wearing a grey shalwar kameez tunic that was covered in blood.  He told Stuff that as soon as the attacker had left he ran back inside the mosque to help those who had been shot.  ""I'm very sad for what has happened but I believe this country is a peaceful country and I hope something good will happen after this,"" he said, fighting back tears.  ""I never thought something like this would happen in New Zeland. Never.""",en,terrorattack,620,['Zealand']

More than 800 children from 19 pre-schools have been tested since March 7 at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases and the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology in Hanoi, with medical authorities fearing more cases to come.  Infection was first suggested last month after cooks at the Thanh Khuong Kindergarten spotted larvae in the school lunch pork supply, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.  When news of the suspected infections began to spread, parents began taking their children to Hanoi for testing in March, leading to positive test results that have spurred concern in the community.  The source of the outbreak, however, has not been definitively confirmed and is currently under investigation.  The species of tapeworm, Taenia solium, is spread through contaminated food.

The court comprising a major-general and two colonels will investigate events in western Myanmar's Rakhine state in August 2017, the military said in a statement posted on the website of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army commander-in-chief.  ""The information is released that the investigation court was formed with the following persons to further scrutinise and confirm the respective incidents,"" the military said.  The court will respond to allegations made by the United Nations and rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch accusing security forces of mass killings, rape and arson.  Myanmar forces launched their offensive in Rakhine State in response to a series of attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security posts near the Bangladesh border.  A UN fact-finding mission last year said the military campaign was orchestrated with ""genocidal intent"" and recommended charging Min Aung Hlaing and five other generals with the ""gravest crimes under international law"".  Myanmar has denied the accusations of murder, rape and other abuses by its forces though Min Aung Hlaing said last month ""a number of security men may have been involved"".  Related Story Bangladesh to move Rohingya to island next month: Minister  Related Story No more room for Rohingya, Bangladesh tells UN  A previous military investigation in 2017 exonerated the security forces of any crimes.  The new court is ""another bad faith manoeuvre"" to fend off international pressure, said Nicholas Bequelin, Southeast Asia and Pacific Director of Amnesty International.  ""The military stands accused of the gravest crimes under international law and has shown no sign of reform,"" he said.  ""The idea that the Tatmadaw could investigate itself and ensure justice and accountability is both dangerous and delusional,"" Bequelin added, referring to the army.  The military information unit did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Myanmar is facing growing international calls for accountability over the Rakhine campaign.  The International Criminal Court has opened a preliminary examination into the violence, while a commission of inquiry formed by Myanmar and including Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, Japan's former ambassador to the UN, is due to publish its findings this year.

A UN Independent Commission of Inquiry found that Israeli soldiers used live ammunition against unarmed protesters, killing at least 189 Palestinians during protests near the separation fence between Israel and Gaza last year.  Over 6,000 Palestinians were also injured in Israeli live fire in the period between March 30, 2018, and December 31, 2018.  ""The Israeli Security Forces committed violations of international human rights and humanitarian law,"" said UN Commissioner Kaari Betty Murungi. ""Some of those violations may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, and must be immediately investigated by Israel.""  The 252-page report scrutinises the Israel Defence Forces' directives for snipers' use of lethal force against Palestinian protesters, who have been regularly demonstrating along the separation fence.  ""The Commission found there was no justification for Israel's security forces killing and injuring persons who pose no imminent threat of death or serious injury to those around them, including journalists, health workers and children,"" said Santiago Canton, the chair of the commission.  Canton said the commission, which presented the report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, had reasonable grounds to believe that during the protests, labelled the Great March of Return, Israeli soldiers killed and gravely injured civilians who were neither participating directly in hostilities nor posing an imminent threat to the Israeli Security Forces, or to the civilian population in Israel.  ""When examining the Israel Defence Forces' use of live fire against the Palestinian protesters, the Commission, however, found that application of lethal force was in the majority of cases authorised unlawfully. This inevitably led to arbitrary deprivation of life,"" said Canton.  The Commissioner Canton called upon Israel to immediately ensure that the rules of engagement of their security forces are revised to comply with international legal standards, especially in view of the one-year anniversary of the protests.  190228102451058  ""We hear that crowds are going to be large at the official protest sites. The excessive use of force that took place on 30 March, 14 May and 12 October 2018 must not be repeated,"" Canton said.  Israeli security forces shot and wounded 6,016 protesters with live ammunition in the period investigated, while 189 people died at the protest sites, 183 of these from live fire. A significant number of persons also died in the days and weeks after they were injured. A total of 73 Palestinian protesters died of gunshot injuries sustained on May 14, 2018.  ""We strongly disagree with the suggestion that the targeting of these demonstrators meets the high human rights standards for using lethal force. Under these rules of engagement, 4,903 unarmed persons were shot in the lower limbs, many while standing hundreds of metres from the snipers,"" said Canton.  Velocity bullets and rifles  The investigation found that Israeli snipers used high velocity bullets and long-range sniper rifles equipped with sophisticated optical aiming devices. ""They saw the target magnified in their sight and they knew the consequences of shooting, but still pulled the trigger, not once or twice but more than 6,000 times,"" said Commissioner Sara Hossain.  ""The snipers killed 32 children, three clearly marked paramedics, and two clearly marked journalists. They shot at unarmed protesters, children and disabled persons, and at health workers and journalists performing their duties, knowing who they were,"" she said.  190307063207081  Israel said it is now carrying out criminal investigations into the killing of 11 Palestinians but the commissioners called for an investigation of all the incidents where Palestinians were either killed or permanently disabled.  Israel claims that the protests by the separation fence masked ""terror activities"" by Palestinian armed groups. However, the commission found that the demonstrations were almost entirely civilian in nature, with clearly stated political aims and did not constitute combat or military campaigns.  While the demonstrations were at times violent, with many protesters hurling stones, cutting through the separation fence at points, and launching kites and balloons with burning coals and rags attached to them, the commission found that the use of lethal force against the protester was neither necessary nor proportionate. Only in two incidents the use of lethal force by the Israeli security forces may not have been unlawful.",en,terrorattack,,

Relatives and friends mourn as they sit next to the body of Israeli rabbi Achiad Ettinger, wrapped in a Jewish prayer shawl, during his funeral, in the Jewish settlement of Eli in the Israeli-occupied West Bank March 18, 2019. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun  The rabbi, Achiad Ettinger, 47, was a father of 12 and a resident of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. He was shot on Sunday shortly after the soldier was stabbed to death at an intersection on a busy highway in the territory.  The Palestinian assailant used the 19-year-old conscriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rifle to fire at the rabbi and wound a second soldier before fleeing in a hijacked car, Israeli officials said.  A spokeswoman at Beilinson hospital near Tel Aviv announced EttingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. He was the head of a religious seminary in Tel Aviv.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The people of Israel are mourning the murder of Rabbi Achiad Ettinger,Ã¢â‚¬Â Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on Twitter.  On Sunday, Culture Minister Miri Regev, one of NetanyahuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most outspoken supporters in his right-wing Likud, seized on the incident to attack his strongest challenger in the April 9 election, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz.  Regev said Gantz, who heads the centrist Blue and White party, would seek the support of an Arab legislator whom she accused of inciting Palestinian violence. Gantz accused Regev of using Israeli deaths for Ã¢â‚¬Å“political propagandaÃ¢â‚¬Â.  The Israeli military was still searching for the suspected attacker, identified in the Israeli media as a 19-year-old Palestinian with no known affiliation with a militant organisation.  Palestinians, many of them individuals without links to armed groups, carried out a wave of attacks in the West Bank in late 2015 and 2016 but the frequency of such incidents has since decreased.  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.  Tensions have also been high along the Israel-Gaza border where Palestinians have been holding weekly protests in support of a right of return to lands in Israel from which they fled or were forced to leave in the war over IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creation in 1948.  On Thursday, Palestinians in Hamas-ruled Gaza fired two rockets at Tel Aviv, causing no damage or injuries. Israel responded with air strikes against Hamas targets.  The incidents have highlighted security as an election issue, with both Netanyahu and Gantz promoting themselves as the best qualified to defend Israel.

Authorities raised the terrorism threat to its highest level in Utrecht province, schools were told to shut their doors and paramilitary police increased security at airports and other vital infrastructure, and also at mosques.  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte convened crisis talks, saying he was deeply concerned about the incident, which came three days after a lone gunman killed 50 people in mass shootings at two mosques in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The police asks you to watch out for 37-year-old Gokman Tanis (born in Turkey) in connection with this morningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incident,Ã¢â‚¬Â Dutch police said in a statement.  They issued an image of the man and warned the public not to approach him. They gave no further details.  Earlier, the head of Dutch counter-terrorism said shots had been fired at several locations, without elaborating. Counter-terrorism units surrounded a house in Utrecht, Dutch television showed, but no one appeared to have been arrested.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“A lot is still unclear at this point and local authorities are working hard to establish all the facts. What we already know is that a culprit is at large,Ã¢â‚¬Â Counter-Terrorism Agency head Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg told a news conference.  Aalbersberg, who said the shooting Ã¢â‚¬Å“appears to be a terrorist attackÃ¢â‚¬Â, declined to comment on the number of injured or on their condition and did not confirm any deaths.  Local broadcaster RTV Utrecht quoted a witness of the tram incident as saying he had seen a woman lying on the ground amid some kind of confrontation and several men running away from the scene.  A reporter for Dutch broadcaster NOS said a white sheet had been placed over a body near the tram where the shooting had taken place.  Utrecht, the NetherlandsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fourth largest city with a population of around 340,000, is known for its picturesque canals and large student population. Gun killings are rare in Utrecht, as elsewhere in the Netherlands.  Police said the tram station stop in a square outside the city centre had been cordoned off. Emergency services were at the scene.    ",en,terrorattack,,

(AFP photo)  UTRECHT, Netherlands:Dutch police on Monday arrested a Turkish-born suspect over a terrorist attack on a tram in the city of Utrecht that left three people dead and five wounded.  Police had earlier launched a huge manhunt for Gokmen Tanis, 37, issuing a picture of him on the tram and warning the public not to approach him.  Heavily armed officers later surrounded a building following the bloodshed in the Netherlands' fourth largest city and his arrest was dramatically announced at the end of a news conference.  Dutch authorities said they were still investigating a likely terrorist motive for the attack but said they ""cannot exclude"" other motives, including a family dispute.  ""We have just heard that the suspect we are looking for has been arrested,"" Utrecht police chief Rob van Bree told a news conference after being handed a piece of paper with news of the arrest.  The head of the Dutch national counter-terrorism service, Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, confirmed ""the arrest of the main suspect for the shooting"".  He said authorities had lowered the threat level in Utrecht from the maximum level five as a result of the arrest.  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the theory that it was a terror attack ""could not be excluded"", vowing that the Netherlands would ""never give way to intolerance"".  Security forces were on high alert at airports and mosques following the shooting, after which a body covered in a white sheet could be seen lying on the tram tracks.  Mosques in Utrecht had shut for the day following the attack, the ANP news agency said, which comes just days after 50 people were killed at mosques in New Zealand in a rampage by an alleged white supremacist.  The city's mayor Jan van Zanen said it was a ""black day for Utrecht"".  Prosecution officer Rutger Jeuken said that ""it looks like what we are dealing with is a terrorist motive"".  But officials added that they ""could not exclude"" reports that the gunman had targeted a woman known to him and others who tried to help her.  Suspect Tanis was reportedly in court in a rape case two weeks ago, broadcaster NOS said.  One witness told NOS they had seen an injured person running out of the tram with blood on her hands and clothes who then fell to the ground.  ""I brought her into my car and helped her. When the police arrived, she was unconscious,"" the witness, who was not named, told the broadcaster.  The father of the suspect, Mehmet Tanis, said his son should be punished if found responsible, a Turkish news agency reported.  ""If he did it he must be punished,"" the DHA agency quoted the father as saying.  He said he had lost contact with his son having returned to his homeland in 2008 after divorcing his wife, DHA reported. She remained in the Netherlands with Gokmen.  ""He did not have an aggressive attitude -- but 11 years have gone by. What happened, what has he experienced? I know nothing whatsoever,"" Mehmet Tanis said.  All major political parties including Rutte's VVD announced that they were suspending campaigning ahead of local elections on Wednesday which will determine the make-up of the Dutch senate.  ""An act of terror is an attack on our civilisation, on our tolerant and open society. If this continues, only one answer is appropriate. And that is that our rule of law and our democracy are stronger than fanaticism and violence,"" Rutte told a brief press conference in The Hague.  ""We will not give way to intolerance. Never.""  The Dutch military police said they were on ""high alert"" and were boosting security at airports and at other vital buildings including parliament and Rutte's office.  Mosques in Utrecht shut for the day following the attack, the ANP news agency said, which comes just days after 50 people were killed at two mosques in New Zealand in a rampage allegedly carried out by a white supremacist.  European allies expressed support for the Dutch government.  ""The EU stands side by side with the Netherlands and its people during these difficult times,"" European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said.  British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was ""hugely concerning news of a gunman opening fire on a tram in Utrecht, no doubt with innocent people just getting on with their day... The UK stands with the people of the Netherlands.""  The Netherlands has been largely spared the kind of attacks which have rocked its closest European neighbours in the past few years, but there has been a series of recent scares.  In August, a 19-year-old Afghan with a German residence permit stabbed and injured two American tourists at Amsterdam's Central Station before being shot and wounded.  In September, Dutch investigators said they had arrested seven people and foiled a ""major attack"" on civilians at a big event in the Netherlands.  In June, two terror suspects were arrested while close to carrying out attacks including at an iconic bridge in Rotterdam and in France, prosecutors said.",en,terrorattack,,

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her coalition was unified on the need to reduce the availability of the kind of weapons used by Brenton Tarrant as he went room to room shooting Muslims gathered for Friday prayers.  ""We have made a decision as a cabinet, we are unified,"" she said, flanked by her coalition partner and deputy prime minister, Winston Peters.  Peters, whose New Zealand First party has previously opposed changes, said he backed the prime minister fully.  ""The reality is that after one pm on Friday our world changed forever, and so will our laws,"" he said.  Ardern, the youthful premier who has become the face of the nation's tragedy, said there would be an inquiry into the horrifying attack, as questions swirl over whether intelligence agencies should have spotted warning signs.  The role of social media has also come under the spotlight, after the gunman livestreamed his rampage on Facebook.  A teenager, whose name cannot be published, appeared in court Monday charged with distributing that footage.  Meanwhile, police launched a probe into a bomb hoax that forced an hours-long closure of the airport in Dunedin on Sunday, where Tarrant lived.  Grief continued to wash across the nation Monday, with New Zealanders of all stripes gathering to express revulsion over the killings -- and a unified front against racial hatred.  Family and friends outside Al Noor mosque -- the scene of the largest massacre -- held a sunset prayer session, with their mournful cries echoing through a park as locals looked on.  ""It just happened to be the time of our evening prayer. Anywhere you are, you can just pray anywhere,"" Saiyad Raza, who had travelled from Auckland to bury his cousin who died in the shootings, told AFP.  Earlier, a Maori cleansing ceremony was performed at the mosque, bringing together indigenous Kiwis, Muslim leaders and local officials.  Dozens of students then paid their respects, with many coming together for a haka -- a traditional Maori ceremonial dance that has been performed by groups across New Zealand in the wake of killings.  And in Auckland, students at Orewa College gathered to form a heart and the message ""Kia Kaha"" -- ""stay strong"" in Maori.  'NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY'  The organisers of New Zealand's largest gun show -- the Kumeu Militaria Show, near Auckland -- announced Monday they had cancelled the event in the wake of the massacre and because of ""elevated security risks"".  Despite having tightened the rules in the 1990s after the last mass shooting, New Zealand has relatively permissive gun laws, with licences granted to nearly every applicant.  David Tipple, the managing director of Gun City, whose online store sold Tarrant four weapons, said he felt no responsibility for the killings.  ""We detected nothing extraordinary about this licence holder,"" he told reporters.  Tarrant, who appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder, on Monday sacked his state-appointed lawyer.  Richard Peters, who represented the alleged killer during the hearing, told AFP the 28-year-old ""wants to be self-represented in this case"".  ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability. He seemed to understand what was going on,"" Peters said.  Under New Zealand law, if Tarrant pleads not guilty his case would normally go to trial, raising the possibility that he could face survivors and victims' families in court.  Mustafa Farouk, president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, told reporters he had faith in the system.  ""As a community, we would like that person to go through the process, the due process, and to be given all his rights,"" he said.  ""We believe in the justice system here and we know it will do what is right.""  But, he cautioned, the attitudes that gave rise to the killing -- documented in a rambling, racist screed released online minutes before the attacks began -- must be tackled.  ""This rise in hatred... by people who call themselves right-wing, whether smaller groups or through reckless politicians, should not be allowed to continue.""  DIGGING GRAVES  Frustrated families of the 50 victims were still waiting Monday for the release of the bodies of their loved ones, as officials worked their way through a painstaking investigation.  Dozens of graves were being dug in readiness for that release, which Police Deputy Commissioner Wally Haumaha said would hopefully happen soon.  ""The process has been highly emotional and stressful for all... as in accordance with Islamic faith the families have wanted the bodies to be returned as soon as possible,"" he said.  ""We have burial expert teams in place ready to receive the bodies at a point in time.""  The dead span generations, aged between three and 77, according to a list circulated among relatives.  Some victims came from the neighbourhood, others from as far afield as Egypt. At least two of the dead came from the same family -- a father and son.  Delhi said Sunday that five of its nationals were killed, while Pakistan said nine of its citizens were among the dead, including one man who died trying to rush Tarrant.  Authorities said 31 people remained in hospital, nine in critical condition.  Reigning Super Rugby champions Canterbury Crusaders, who play in Christchurch, said Monday they would consider changing their name after criticism that it was historically insensitive.

""The scenes of the massacres in the two mosques should wake up those who were fooled, and should incite the supporters of the caliphate to avenge their religion,"" the spokesman, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, said in a 44-minute audio recording.  Al-Muhajir portrayed the shootings by a white extremist, which killed 50 Muslims as they prayed in the city of Christchurch, as an extension of the campaign against ISIS. He likened the mosque attacks to the weeks long battle raging in the last village under ISIS control in Syria.  ""Here is Baghuz in Syria, where Muslims are burned to death and are bombed by all known and unknown weapons of mass destruction,"" he said, painting the people in the town as regular Muslims when in fact coalition officials believe that the majority of them are either ISIS fighters or their wives and children.  Throughout his speech, al-Muhajir belittled the White House's claim of victory over the terrorist organisation, calling it a ""state of confusion and contradiction that make it impossible for any observer to know what is meant by the word 'victory.'""  While ISIS has lost all but a sliver of the vast territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, military officials say the group remains a potent threat.  Al-Muhajir - the name is an invention, and his true identity is unknown - is a faceless but important figure inside the terrorist group. He is not known to have ever appeared in photographs or in the group's numerous videos, and almost nothing is known about his personal biography.  In a testament to the security precautions he takes, he released just two audio statements in 2018, with the last one, appearing in September, less than four minutes long. The spokesman's extended absences - much like those of the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - have fueled rumours of his death.  Beyond its references to recent events, what is notable about the recording - which was released by the group on the Telegram mobile messaging app - are its numerous mentions of in-the-weeds details regarding ISIS-related current events.  Al-Muhajir refers to President Donald Trump's claim not to know Brett McGurk, the US special envoy in the fight against the ISIS group, who resigned in protest over Mr Trump's decision to pull US troops from Syria.  Related Story World focus: ISIS is down but it is not out yet  Related Story US President Donald Trump starts withdrawal of US forces from Syria, claims victory  Related Story US President Donald Trump starts withdrawal of US forces from Syria, claims victory  Related Story 'One of New Zealand's darkest days': At least 49 killed in terror attacks on Christchurch mosques  As anti-ISIS forces pursue al-Muhajir and other senior members of the militant group, it is assumed that they avoid detection by shunning electronics, especially cellphones, and limiting contact with couriers, whose movements can be tracked.  That raises a number of questions: How did he know about the slaughter of Muslims in New Zealand? Is he hunkered down in a house in Iraq or Syria and relying on local TV coverage? Did one of his aides bring him the news?  His detailed knowledge of current events is clear as he makes a jab at Mr Trump's hasty visit to Iraq in December, his first to see troops stationed in a combat zone. At the time, the president called it ""sad"" that he had to take such extensive security measures to make the trip even after the US had spent US$7 trillion (S$9.46 trillion) trying to stabilise the Middle East.  Al-Muhajir refers to the US$7 trillion, adding: ""How strange for a victor who can't even announce publicly an official visit to a country he claims to be bringing peace and stability to. He could only come like a frightened and cowardly thief.""  Among the revelations in the recording is that al-Baghdadi, the group's leader, is still alive, at least according to the spokesman. Although al-Baghdadi has been declared dead several times, most recently by Russia after an airstrike in Syria, US officials have long maintained that he is most likely still living.  Al-Muhajir closes the recording by referring to al-Baghdadi using an honorific, ""May God preserve him,"" that is employed when a person is still alive.  In the final passage of his speech, the spokesman offers a tip from al-Baghdadi, suggesting he has spoken to him: ""A message of advice from the caliph of the believers regarding communication devices: Be careful, careful of communication devices - even if it slows down work from two days to seven days.""",en,terrorattack,,

The new movement was launched about a month ago, with the slogan ""we want to live"", by a group of media activists not affiliated to political parties.  The first protest, which took place on Thursday, was repressed by dozens of Hamas security forces, who dispersed protesters by beating them and firing in the air. Videos of the crackdown were widely circulated on social media.  Hamas security forces also broke into citizens' homes and carried out arrest campaigns throughout the strip in Gaza City and Jabaliya refugee camp in the north, Deir al-Balah in the middle district, and Khan Younis and Rafah in the south.  Protesters said they were attacked with batons by Hamas forces while protesting against the dire living conditions in Gaza Strip. Israa Buhaisi, a journalist with Al-Alam news channel, told Al Jazeera her father and brother were beaten up by Hamas security forces, while they were trying to intervene between said forces and a group of protesters getting attacked by them.  ""A group of protesters had gathered near the centre of Deir Al-Balah camp, holding posters and chanting slogans - 'We want to live. We want to work. Our future is lost',"" Buhaisi said.  ""This is a popular movement. People took to the street to ask for a solution for their miserable life in Gaza.""  Hamas forces came to the place and asked the activists to vacate the area but the protesters refused to leave, the 34-year-old said.  Supporters of Hamas have claimed that the movement was backed by its rival government based in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority.  Talking to Al Jazeera, a Hamas spokesman denied the existence of a popular independent movement, however, in an official statement, he said that the Hamas security forces had arrested employees previously under the payroll of the West Bank government, who were ""blackmailed by the PA to provoke chaos in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the return of their salaries"".  ""We emphasise that we support peaceful demonstration, but we will not allow the exploitation of the protests to provoke chaos,"" Iyad al-Buzom said.  The security forces arrested a number of protesters and took them to an unknown area, then they raided a number of homes in the refugee camp, mostly belonging to the Buhaisi family.  ""The police started to beat the protesters in the area and clashes erupted between the two sides,"" Buhaisi said.  ""Vehicles belonging to the security forces arrived at the scene and attacked protesters in the area. My father, who is 60 years old, tried to mediate to stop the assault, but he was also beaten up by the forces and they broke his hand.""  According to Buhaisi, around 70 members of the family are still in the detention of Hamas security forces. They took my dad who is a cancer patient, but they released him the same day,"" Buhaisi added.  Movement supported by factions  Nearly a dozen Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip have declared their support for the youth movement and their support for what the group calls ""just demands"" - which include establishing a labour office that protects workers' rights from exploitation; ending control of goods and prices by some parties and monitoring the work of the private sector; and suspending all taxes burdening citizens.  The factions also denounced the Hamas attack on protesters and called on the movement to respond to the demands of easing taxes.  Baker Abu Safia, a member of the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), said that the Palestinian people have been very patient during the last 12 years of the blockade.  ""We support this popular movement,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""People have the right to express themselves. We all live under occupation and the sacrifices of the people must be respected.""  In a statement, the factions said that the catastrophic crisis currently affecting the Gaza Strip is essentially caused by the Israeli occupation, and the Israeli and Egyptian blockade since 2007.  The factions also pointed out a number of domestic political issues, such as the Palestinian political division between Hamas and Fatah, and the punitive measures adopted by the PA against the population of the coastal enclave, such as forcing many of its employees into early retirement and not paying the Israeli power plant to supply the population of Gaza with electricity.  The statement also laid fault on the decisions of Hamas officials in Gaza to impose more taxes, which has contributed to the high costs of living and the deteriorating conditions of Palestinians in the strip.  Worsening of public freedoms  ""There were serious violations of human rights, the right to peaceful demonstration and the freedom of expression,"" Mustafa Ibrahim, a human rights researcher in the Independent Commission of Human Rights (ICHR) told Al Jazeera.  ""The security forces, which the public prosecution abetted by preventing media coverage, violently beat up, detained and broke into civilian homes under the pretext that protesters threw stones and that the demonstration is supported by PA and Fatah.""  ""This attack on human rights has clearly shown that the security forces don't respect the human rights situation,"" Ibrahim said, adding that 20 journalists were detained. ""This reflects the deterioration of the state of public freedoms in Gaza.""  Ibrahim's colleague in the occupied West Bank, Ammar Dweik, told local Palestinian news agency Ma'an that Hamas has apologised to the ICHR for the attack on its members, but the rights group is awaiting further investigation and accountability, and most importantly an end to transgressions against citizens.  ""We will continue to monitor violations in the Gaza Strip, and demand access to visit detention centres in the Gaza Strip,"" Dweik said.  In a statement, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) condemned the attack by Hamas police officers on peaceful protesters, calling it ""a crime and violation according to the national and international laws"" and called upon the security services to ""respect the right to peaceful assembly and right to freedom of expression"".  PCHR also called upon the security services ""to immediately and unconditionally release the dozens of detainees, and for the competent authorities to take the necessary measures to stop such violations and respect civilians' public freedoms"".  'Everyone is under siege'  Mohsen Abu Ramadan, a Gaza-based political analyst, said that the movement was a result of the unprecedented high rates of poverty and unemployment in the Gaza Strip, which has reached 70 percent among the youth.  Around 20,000 university graduates each year find no jobs, which has caused a number of social problems in the strip. Furthermore, the withdrawal of a number of international NGOs working in Gaza has deepened economic problems.  ""The violent reaction of the Hamas security forces has incensed public opinion,"" Abu Ramadan said, explaining that Hamas should have dealt better with the movement without resorting to physical attacks.  ""Everyone in Gaza is under occupation and under siege,"" he said. ""People here have embraced the resistance wing of Hamas and are still participating in the weekly Friday return march protests.  ""The state of anger is not directed against Hamas but against the current situation of the people, but Hamas does not seem to read the message and reacted emotionally,"" he said.  Regarding the pro-Hamas claims that the PA is behind the movement, Abu Ramadan said: ""I think these excuses are readily prepared from both sides. I blame some parties specifically in the official Palestinian media, who used these protests to incite against Hamas.  The demonstrations do have popular backing, he said, adding that it was not appropriate for any party to use them for their own interest.",en,terrorattack,,

DOH said children 9 months to less than 5 years old may receive the vaccine, which will be administered through an immunization campaign. Health officials will be introducing the vaccine in the 4 regions, as these areas were the most affected by the disease.  Health Secretary Francisco Duque III assured the public that the vaccines are safe, saying the World Health Organization (WHO) has reviewed its safety and effectiveness and that the Food and Drug Administration has approved it.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is safe and effective. It has been used for over 30 years in 12 countries and given to more than 400 million children with an excellent safety record,Ã¢â‚¬Â Duque said.  Health officials were scheduled to give children the vaccine in March, following the WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recommendation to set immunization outside periods where the occurrence of Japanese Encephalitis was high. For the Philippines, DOH said that means giving the vaccine before the rainy season Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when the disease peaks.  What is Japanese Encephalitis? Endemic in the Philippines, Japanese Encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral disease and is the leading cause of viral encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in Asia.  Children were considered most at risk for the disease. Symptoms include high fever, chills, headache, and fatigue.  The disease can rapidly lead to infection of the brain. According to the DOH, 3 out of 10 individuals who experience severe illness from the disease will die. Among those who survive, over half may suffer from paralysis, recurrent seizures, or inability to speak, among others.  Data from the DOH epidemiology bureau showed there were cases of Japanese Encephalitis in every region of the country. There has also been a steady increase in cases recoded, with 122 laboratory confirmed cases of the disease seen in 2016, 275 in 2017, and 340 in 2018.  Why this matters: The introduction of the vaccine comes as the DOH is struggling to contain a measles outbreak that has swept across the country.  Introducing the Japanese Encephalitis once again puts to the test the health departmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to increase vaccination coverage. Immunization rates plummeted in the wake of the Dengvaxia scare in November 2017.  In a previous interview with Rappler, National Immunization Program manager Wilda Silva said the introduction of the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine was long overdue. It was supposed to be introduced in late 2017. (Post Dengvaxia controversy: Paving the way forward for vaccines, health care)  Health officials likewise said vaccination against the disease was the Ã¢â‚¬Å“only effective measureÃ¢â‚¬Â to stop transmission of the disease and bring down the number of cases.

To mark the March 30 anniversary, a three-person U.N. war crimes investigation team, as part of a Commission of Inquiry (COI), has released a report indicating that Israeli security forces committed possible war crimes and crimes against humanity, and this week called on Israelis to prevent snipers from using lethal force against demonstrators.  However, Israel supporters and U.N. critics have this week blasted the leading human rights body and the report for failing to illuminate alleged Hamas war crimes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in particular, the widespread and illegal use of human shields.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Since the 2014 Gaza conflict, Hamas (has) used civilians as human shields for its own fighters. Similar tactics were successfully adopted by Hezbollah against Israel in their 2006 conflict,Ã¢â‚¬Â Lt. Gen Richard Natonski, a retired U.S. Marine and member of the Hybrid Warfare Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security America (JINSA), told Fox News. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The use of human shields in combat is contrary to Western thinking and the law of armed conflict. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to imagine how this wasn't mentioned in the U.N. report, except for perhaps a certain bias by the authors of the report against Israel.""  ISRAELÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S AMBASSADOR CALLS ON UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TO CONDEMN HAMAS FOLLOWING ROCKET ATTACKS  JINSA has issued its own report, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Defending the Fence: Legal and Operational Challenges in Hamas-Israel Clashes,Ã¢â‚¬Â to counter the U.N. report's narrative.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hamas systematically violates international law by purposely using Gazan Palestinian civilians as human shields for attacking Israel, provoking Israeli actions that would lead to civilian casualties, and attacking Israeli civilians indiscriminately,Ã¢â‚¬Â the JINSA report stated, underscoring that the COIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s report both Ã¢â‚¬Å“undermines the international legal regime it seeks to enhance and sets a precedent encouraging Hamas and similar armed groups to double down on these illegal tactics.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Some Israel supporters have accused the U.N. Human Rights Council of being complicit in HamasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“terror campaignÃ¢â‚¬Â against Israel.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The U.N. report validates the illegal tactics used by Hamas against Israel, and sets a precedent encouraging not only Hamas, but similar groups like Hezbollah, to continue placing civilians in harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way,Ã¢â‚¬Â Natonski said.  Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have been quick to condemn the U.N. council and its report as anti-Semitic and partisan. Israel went on to boycott its debate on Monday as hundreds of Israel proponents Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including American officials Ã¢â‚¬â€œ massed outside the U.N. building in Geneva.  The 252-page U.N. report makes brief mention of Israeli claims that Hamas, a designated terrorist organization in the United States, was using human shields and that journalists were acting as shields to protect Hamas operatives.  TRUMP TEAM VOWS TO HIT BACK AGAINST RUSSIA AND CHINAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S 'POLAR SILK ROAD' WITH ARCTIC DEFENSE STRATEGY  Ã¢â‚¬Å“TerroristsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ use of human shields is a remarkably effective tactic against countries like the U.S. and Israel, whose ethical and military codes require avoiding civilian casualties. Terrorists hide among civilians to shelter themselves from lawful attacks or deliberately cause civilian casualties,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). Ã¢â‚¬Å“Terrorists and their sponsoring regimes must be held accountable for their brutal practice of using civilians as human shields. The U.N. CommissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unwillingness to hold Hamas accountable for its war crimes only costs more civilian lives.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined the chorus of condemnation by taking aim at the U.N. report, calling the Ã¢â‚¬Å“useful idiotsÃ¢â‚¬Â at the United Nations Ã¢â‚¬Å“absurd and dishonest.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hamas and Hezbollah use human shields as a deliberate tactic,Ã¢â‚¬Â the veteran GOP lawmaker said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They use innocent Palestinian civilians, to put them in harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way, because they intend to exploit those human shields for when they are injured or killed when Israel defends itself.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The Trump administration pulled out of the U.N Human Rights Council last year, specifying an inherent anti-Israel prejudice at the organization as a key reason for withdrawal.  Despite the criticism, the COI is remaining firm in their findings, which allege that 183 or the 189 who were killed in the skirmishes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which also included 32 children Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were killed by live fire, and that such live ammunition also wounded more than 6,000 Palestinians.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The most important thing for the government of Israel is to review the rules of engagement immediately and to ensure that the rules of engagement are according to accepted international standards,Ã¢â‚¬Â Santiago Canton, the commissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chairman, told the Human Rights Council this week.  GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The commission has furthermore submitted a clandestine file to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) naming specific individuals responsible for alleged violations and advocating that the dossier be passed to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

The assailant was killed after he opened fire at Israeli forces who had come to arrest him, the Israeli Shin Bet security service said on Tuesday. The Palestinian health ministry confirmed a person had been killed in the clash, but provided no further details.  In what appeared to be a separate incident, the Palestinian health ministry said two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers near the West Bank city of Nablus. An Israeli army spokeswoman said the report was being looked into.  On Sunday, a suspected Palestinian assailant fatally stabbed a soldier at an intersection on a busy West Bank highway and opened fire at the scene using the conscript's rifle, killing an Israeli rabbi and wounding a second soldier.  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site of the attack on Monday and pledged tough action, including the demolition of the assailant's home. ""These terrorists will not uproot us from here,"" he said.  Palestinians - many without links to armed groups - carried out a wave of attacks in the West Bank in late 2015 and 2016 but the frequency of such incidents has since decreased.  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.  Relatives arrested  The Palestinian attacker was identified by Israeli authorities as Omar Amin Abu Laila from the West Bank town of Az-Zawiya.  Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported the army had arrested some of Abu Laila's relatives on Monday.  Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, praised the West Bank attack as a ""natural response to crimes committed by the Israeli occupation"".  The attack came after two Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces last week in separate West Bank incidents.  On Thursday, two rockets from Gaza were fired towards Tel Aviv in a rare attack into the heart of Israel that looked to set the sides into another round of escalation.  Hamas denied Israel's accusation it was behind the rocket fire. However, Israel went on to target several sites belonging to Hamas' military wing in Gaza with about 100 missiles.",en,terrorattack,,

But after taking samples from some pigs, local officials in the Xushui district of Baoding city, about an hour's drive from Beijing, said their tests came back negative, said Mr Sun Dawu, the chairman of Hebei Dawu Agriculture Group, the farm owner.  As hundreds of pigs began dying daily on the 20,000-head farm, the company obtained a test kit that showed some positive results for the virus. But after further lobbying by Xinda, officials just offered the company subsidies for farm buildings and other investments, said Mr Sun.  Mr Sun's account of events and pictures taken by farm staff of dead pigs lying in rows and a pile outside the farm could not be independently verified.  Xushui district said in a faxed response to Reuters on Tuesday that it was opening an investigation into the case, adding that it had found some ""discrepancies"" with the reported version of events.  ""If there is illegal behaviour, relevant departments will handle it according to the law,"" added the statement from the local government's investigative committee.  Farmers and other industry insiders told Reuters that China's African swine fever epidemic is far more extensive than official reports suggest, making the disease harder to contain, potentially causing pork shortages and increasing the likelihood that it will spread beyond China's borders.  ""Our full expectation is that the number of cases is under-reported,"" said Mr Paul Sundberg, executive director at the Swine Health Information Centre in Ames, Iowa, which is funded by American pork producers.  ""And if there's so much of that virus in the environment in China, then we are at increased risk of importing it.""  China does not permit the commercial sale of African swine fever test kits, though many are now available. Official confirmation must come from a state-approved laboratory.  ""Public confirmation of disease is the government's job,"" Mr Sun told Reuters at his company headquarters in Xushui in late February.  Frustrated by the lack of action and mounting losses from the disease, Mr Sun eventually published details of the suspected outbreak on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo on Feb 22.  Two days later, it became the first African swine fever case in Hebei province, one of the north's top pig-producing regions, to be reported by China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, about seven weeks after the company says it had alerted local authorities.  By then, more than 15,000 pigs on the Xinda farm had already died, said Mr Sun, and the company even sold on thousands of pigs - potentially spreading the disease further.  Mr Sun said officials did not explain why their first test had been negative, though he suggested it may have been because they took samples from live pigs on the farm and did not test the dead ones.  China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not reply to a faxed request for comment on the case.  The Agriculture Ministry has warned against covering up outbreaks of the disease, and in January highlighted two large farms that had tried to conceal outbreaks.  Related Story China has culled more than 900,000 pigs due to African swine fever  Related Story AVA suspends pork import from areas in China with African swine fever outbreaks  Related Story 'Very serious' African swine fever spreads in China  Related Story China finds African swine fever virus in some animal feed products  UNCONFIRMED OUTBREAKS  Detailed accounts of unconfirmed outbreaks shared with Reuters by two other farm company managers suggest Mr Sun's experience is not unique.  In one case in northern China last year, local officials declined to even carry out a test. In another case in Shandong province, official test results came back negative, despite clinical symptoms that strongly pointed to African swine fever and a positive test result obtained by the company itself.  Neither manager was willing to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.  Once an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) is confirmed, all pigs on the farm, as well as any within a 3km radius, must be culled and disposed of, according to Chinese law, and farmers should be paid 1,200 yuan (S$242.09) per pig culled.  For some cash-strapped county governments, avoiding compensation payments could be an incentive not to report disease, said a senior official with a major pig producer.  When the disease hit one of the company's 6,000-head sow farms in the north-east in November, local authorities did nothing, the official said.  ""It was never tested by the government. We couldn't do the test because we didn't have the capability. But there's no question it was ASF, based on the symptoms and lesions,"" he told Reuters, declining to be identified because of company policy.  A county official in northeastern Liaoning province told Reuters in January that the local government had poured so much money and resources into preventing and controlling African swine fever that it risked bankrupting the county.  But wealthy Shandong province, northern China's biggest producer of hogs, has only confirmed one case of the disease, on Feb 20.  Insiders at one company said four of its farms in the province had suffered swine fever infections, however, suggesting more unconfirmed outbreaks may have occurred.  After the company's first outbreak in early January the local government tested and the results came back negative, said an executive, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.  Shandong province's animal husbandry bureau did not respond to a fax seeking comment on unreported cases.  'SPATIAL RANDOMNESS'  There is no cure or vaccine for African swine fever and it kills about 90 per cent of infected pigs.  Analysts forecast pig production in China, which eats about half of the world's pork, will fall more than during the 2006 'blue ear' epidemic, one of the worst disease outbreaks in recent years, with some expecting a decline of around 30 per cent in 2019.  That would send meat prices soaring and trigger huge demand for imports.  The Agriculture Ministry said last week the pig herd in February had dropped 16.6 per cent year-on-year, and sow stocks were down more than 19 per cent.  China also has a patchy record of reporting disease. Details of the blue ear outbreak, which infected more than two million hogs, did not emerge until months after the damage had already been done, and the number of pigs that died is still disputed.  Like blue ear, African swine fever does not harm people. But it is classified a reportable disease by the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), a global body that promotes transparency, and member country China is obliged to report each outbreak.  ""You need to move faster than the virus, it's a very simple equation of how to control disease,"" said Dr Trevor Drew, director of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory at the national research agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.  ""If you don't know where the virus is, you can't stop it.""  Since August 2018, Beijing has reported 112 outbreaks in 28 provinces and regions. The increase has slowed considerably in 2019 and the Agriculture Ministry said earlier this month the situation was ""gradually improving"".  But some suspect the disease is worse than the official data suggests.  ""I am very much hoping that I am wrong, but if I consider the epidemiological characteristics of this virus disease, I would have to be extremely sceptical,"" said Dr Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at the City University of Hong Kong.  He pointed to the ""spatial randomness"" of the reported outbreaks, unusual for an infectious disease, which normally develops in clusters.  The high rate of detection of the virus in food products carried from China to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia, as well as domestically, also indicated a much higher presence of the virus in Chinese pigs than reported, said Dr Pfeiffer and others.  LARGE FARMS, LARGE LOSSES  With an extremely high density of pigs, raised largely on low-biosecurity farms, tackling disease is widely recognised as a major challenge for China.  But the disease has hit both small farms and large producers, say industry insiders, despite better hygiene and training at factory farms.  ""The large producers have not been spared,"" said a manager with a company that supplies several of China's top pig producers. ""Everyone is trying really hard on biosecurity, but they're still getting outbreaks, and they're frustrated and losing hope.""  He said he knew of eight large breeding farms that had experienced outbreaks, including two on very large, 10,000-head sow farms. None were officially reported.  He declined to be named or to reveal the names of the producers because of client confidentiality.  Beijing has not officially reported any swine fever on the farms of large listed producers, whose shares are trading at record levels as investors bet the big producers will benefit from tighter supplies.  Mr Qin Yinglin, the chairman of China's No. 2 producer, Muyuan Foods Co Ltd, which raised 11 million pigs for slaughter last year, said most large companies were likely to be infected.  ""If you checked carefully, testing one-by-one, then for sure everyone has it,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""This is a high probability event.""  He said it was ""not yet known"" if his firm had been hit.",en,diseas,,

The Turkish leader has presented the mosque attacks, by a self-avowed white supremacist who killed 50 people, as part of a wider assault on Islam and demands the West do more against anti-Muslim sentiment.  Advertisement  ""Just as humanity fought against anti-Semitism after the Holocaust disaster, it should fight against rising Islamophobia in the same determined fashion,"" Erdogan told an emergency meeting of ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul.  ""Right now we are facing Islamophobia and Muslim hatred,"" he said.  During the Mar 15 attack, alleged gunman Brenton Tarrant killed 50 men, women and children - the victims aged between three and 77 years old - in a massacre that sparked global revulsion.  He livestreamed much of the attack and spread a manifesto on social media claiming it was a strike against Muslim ""invaders"".  Advertisement  Advertisement  Representatives from the OIC, which groups Muslim countries, said in a statement that ""genuine, comprehensive and systematic measures"" were needed to tackle the ""affliction"" of Islamophobia.  They called on countries with Muslim communities and minorities to refrain from statements and actions that associate Islam with ""terror, extremism and threats.""  In his hate-filled ""manifesto"" before the mass killing, the accused killer suggested neo-Nazi ideology and immigration prompted his action and mentioned other right-wing extremists.  He also referenced Turkey, and Istanbul's landmark Hagia Sophia, that was once a church before becoming a mosque during the Ottoman empire.  NO STONE UNTURNED  New Zealand's government on Friday reassured Muslims living in the country they would be ""safe and secure"" despite the deadly attacks in Christchurch.  ""Ensuring Muslim communities in New Zealand feel safe and secure is a particular focus,"" New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters told the OIC meeting.  Peters said New Zealand authorities would make sure ""no stone stays unturned"" in the prosecution of the attacker.  ""This person will face the full force of New Zealand law and spend the rest of his life in isolation in a New Zealand prison,"" he said.  Erdogan, campaigning for local elections this month, had angered New Zealand's government by repeatedly showing the video made by the alleged gunman, an Australian who was arrested after the massacre.  The Turkish leader also angered Australia with comments about anti-Muslim Australians being sent back in ""coffins"" like their grandfathers at Gallipoli, a bloody World War I battle.  More than 8,000 Australians and nearly 3,000 New Zealanders - part of forces known as ANZAC - died fighting Turkish forces at Gallipoli, which has a prominent place in Australia's collective memory.  On Friday, the tone was more conciliatory. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu praised New Zealand authorities and their ""sincere solidarity messages"".  ""We are here to show we are one body against Islamophobic actions across the world,"" he said.  Peters said he did not feel a need to discuss the Turkish leader's use of the attack video, but he said he had been reassured on Erdogan's Gallipoli comments.  ""We are returning home to New Zealand with grateful reassurance that our people who come here to commemorate ANZAC will be as welcome as they always were,"" he told reporters.  The Muslim call to prayer rang out across New Zealand on Friday followed by two minutes of silence nationwide to mark a week since the attack. Thousands of people - including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern - stood silently in a park opposite the mosque where the killing began.  ",en,terrorattack,,

None of the multiple extremist groups operating in Burkina Faso could be reached for comment.  HRW documented ""the execution by Burkinabe security forces of over 115 men accused of supporting or harbouring the armed Islamists"", as well as 42 killings carried out by extremists of suspected government collaborators.  All the violence occurred near the northern borders with Mali and Niger, between April 2018 and January 2019.

However, any evidence of reprisals would present an uncomfortable dilemma for Western allies such as France and the United States: backing security forces in countries such as Burkina Faso is key to containing the Islamist threat, but that support is meant to be conditional on respect for human rights.  Burkina declared a state of emergency in several provinces in December following an attack by an al Qaeda-linked group. The state of emergency was extended by six months in January after an dozens died in ethnic violence triggered by the suspected extremist killing of a traditional ruler.  Thousands of people have fled their homes as a result of militant attacks and reprisals by Burkinabe forces.  According to the HRW report, in the village of Gasseliki, about 230km north of the capital Ouagadougou, jihadists killed 12 people.  ""They kicked the door in, went room to room and found us hiding,"" the report quoted a witness as saying. Reprisals by security forces were mostly carried out by a detachment of about 100 gendarmes, or military police, based in the town of Arbinda, since late August, it said.  Most were from the Fulani ethnic group, whom the jihadists have targeted heavily for recruitment.

The offensive saw U.S.-backed forces attacking ISIS, pushing its fighters from house to house and tent to tent against the Euphrates River, according to reports. The battle stretched several weeks and sent thousands fleeing the territory and hundreds killed.  Ciya Kobani, an SDF commander, announced the end of the operation from the rooftop: ""We have been victorious against Daesh,"" he declared.

The Shabaab attackers died in a shootout as government forces fought back  Claimed by the Al-Shabaab Islamist group, the assault was a sign of the insurgency's continued ability to strike at the heart of Somalia's government, despite years of foreign military support for Mogadishu.  The fighting began with two blasts at the gates of the complex housing the labour and works ministries.  Police say at least four gunmen then stormed the buildings, leading to a shootout as officers rushed to confront the attackers.  ""The death toll reached eleven, three of them women, and the number of wounded is 15,"" said Abdukadir Abdirahman Adan, director of Mogadishu's Aamin ambulance service.  Senator Ilyas Ali Hassan confirmed that Saqar Ibrahim Abdalla, the deputy minister for labour and social affairs, was also killed.  ""I cannot elaborate on how he died but I can confirm that he was killed inside the ministry building,"" Hassan said.  Police official Ibrahim Mohamed said all the gunmen were killed.  ""There were some other casualties including members of the police,"" he said, without elaborating.  - Siege attacks -  Attacks that combine bombings with gunmen have become a speciality of the Al-Qaeda linked group, which is running an armed insurrection against what it sees as heretic and foreign influence in Somalia.  The group emerged from Islamic Courts that once controlled central and southern Somalia and are variously estimated to number between 5,000 and 9,000 men.  In 2010 the Shabaab declared their allegiance to Al-Qaeda. The following year, the group were chased out of Mogadishu by the 22,000-strong African Union peace-enforcement mission, AMISOM.  They have since lost many of their strongholds but retain control of large rural swathes of the country and continue to wage a guerrilla war, frequently hitting Mogadishu.  In October 2017 a truck bombing in a busy neighbourhood of the capital killed over 500 people, the deadliest attack in Somalia to date.  - Targeting Kenya -  Among Al-Shabaab's adversaries is the US military, which has killed over 800 people in airstrikes targeting the insurgents over the last two years.  This week Amnesty International released a report challening the US's claim that the airtrikes only killed ""terrorists.""  Amnesty researchers say at least 14 civilians were killed in US bombings. The US military denied the report.  The have also carried out a string of attacks in Kenya since 2011.  The deadliest of these took place on April 2, 2015 when 148 people were killed at Garissa University in northeastern Kenya.

The air strikes killed 13 civilians, said Safiullah Amiri, a member of Kunduz provincial council. The casualties included children, said fellow council member Amruddin, who pegged the civilian death toll at 12.  The bodies were brought into Kunduz city in the back of a truck as part of protests by dozens of civilians.  The civilian deaths occurred as Afghan and Taliban forces claimed to inflict heavy losses on each other in that province and in Helmand, two Taliban strongholds.  A spokeswoman for the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan did not respond immediately to questions on Sunday. Resolute Support, comprising troops from 39 countries, trains, advises and assists Afghan security forces.  The New York Times reported earlier that the air strikes that killed civilians followed a firefight between U.S. and Afghan soldiers that had been provoked by a Taliban working inside Afghan forces. Reuters has not confirmed the paperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s report.  Four Afghan soldiers died in the fight, a senior Afghan military source said.  A record number of Afghan civilians were killed last year as aerial attacks and suicide bombings increased, the United Nations said in a February report.  Kunduz is also where two U.S. soldiers were killed in combat on Friday. The U.S. Department of Defense identified the soldiers as Specialist Joseph Collette, 29, and Sgt. Will Lindsay, 33.  Fighting has accelerated during a period of recurring peace talks. The latest negotiating round concluded this month with U.S. and Taliban officials citing progress toward ending the 17-year war.  Afghan forces, with NATO air support, killed 58 Taliban, including several commanders, in Kunduz, the defence ministry said on Saturday via Twitter. The Taliban said that it had killed 19 members of Afghan forces and five from foreign forces.  Fighting was also fierce in Helmand, including more civilian deaths.  The Taliban on Saturday claimed an attack at a stadium celebration of Farmers Day in Helmand, which killed four people and wounded 31, including minor injuries to the provinceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s governor.

The developments set the stage for a potential major conflagration, shortly before Israel's upcoming elections.  The rocket attack destroyed a residential home in the community of Mishmeret, north of the city of Kfar Saba, wounding six members of the family.  Israel's ambulance service said it treated seven people overall, including two women who were moderately wounded. The others, including two children and an infant, had minor wounds.  The sounds of air raid sirens jolted residents of the Sharon area, northeast of Tel Aviv, from their sleep shortly after 5am (03:00 GMT). A strong sound of an explosion followed.  An Israeli military spokesperson said the rocket attack was carried out by Hamas, adding that the army was set to deploy two brigades and infantry units to the southern Gaza area. It also called up reserves after the rocket attack.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's incident. Al Jazeera reached out to Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip but received no response.  Later on Monday, a Hamas official denied to AFP news agency that the movement was behind the attack.    ""No one from the resistance movements, including Hamas, has an interest in firing rockets from the Gaza Strip towards the enemy,"" the official said on condition of anonymity, evoking the possibility that the strike may have been caused by ""bad weather"".    He added that the same message had been delivered to Egypt, which has acted as mediator between Israel and Hamas.  'Forceful response'  Netanyahu, who was in Washington to meet President Donald Trump, held emergency consultations with military officials back in Israel and decided to cut his visit short, cancelling a planned address to the AIPAC conference and meetings with congressional leaders.  ""There has been a criminal attack on the State of Israel and we will respond forcefully,"" he said. ""In a few hours I will meet with President Trump. I will return to Israel immediately afterward.""  Speaking from occupied West Jerusalem, Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker said that Netanyahu is under ""huge pressure"" to act.  ""An escalation in response could be something like seeing Israel target the homes or positions of Hamas leaders,"" she said.  190314233115842  ""Israeli media reported former security officials saying that what is needed now is a more forceful response to cut out the capability of Hamas.""  Witnesses in Gaza told AP news agency they saw Hamas officials evacuating government premises, anticipating an Israeli response to the alleged attack.  Hamas also announced that its Gaza chief, Yehiya Sinwar, had cancelled a scheduled public speech. Israel also shut down its main cargo crossing into Gaza.  Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett on the Gaza-Israel border said that ""most people are expecting a major Israeli operation.""  He said the Sderot regional council, the local government on the Israeli side of the Gaza border told them that ""there has been a warning given to Israeli residents around here to expect Israeli military action soon, and to expect the sound of explosions coming from the Gaza Strip.""  According to local Palestinian news agency Maan, the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, Ziyad al-Nakhla, said that if Israel launches an attack on the Gaza Strip, it would provoke a ""strong response"".  Monday's attack came 10 days after rockets were fired from Gaza towards Tel Aviv.  The Israeli military at the time struck back and the sides appeared to be hurtling towards another confrontation. But Gaza's Hamas leaders said the rocket was fired accidentally and calm was quickly restored.  Dire economic situation  Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007. The group won a decisive victory in parliamentary elections a year before, but western governments refused to recognise their win.  In June 2007, Hamas fought against a pre-emptive coup by its rival Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority, resulting in driving it out of the strip.  The same summer saw Israel and Egypt impose an ongoing land, naval and air blockade on the coastal enclave. Israel has also waged three offensives on Gaza since December 2008. The last such offensive was in 2014, in which more than 2,000 Palestinians - the majority of them civilians - were killed.  The 52-day war also severely damaged Gaza's already weak infrastructure, leading the United Nations to state that the strip would be ""uninhabitable"" by 2020.  190316225136995  The blockade against Gaza, combined with sanctions by the rival Palestinian Authority, have exacerbated a dire economic crisis in the enclave. Recently, Hamas has come under rare public criticism for the harsh conditions in the territory.  The latest outburst comes at a sensitive time for both sides. Israel is holding national elections in 15 days.  Netanyahu, who also served as defence minister, is locked in a tight fight for re-election and has faced heavy criticism from his opponents for what they say has been an ineffective response to armed groups in Gaza.  Egypt, Qatar and the UN are trying to broker a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas but that effort has yet to bring about an agreement.  At the same time, there has been an uptick in violence in the occupied West Bank over the past week, with Israel killing two Palestinians it said attacked its troops.",en,terrorattack,,

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.  (CNN) In the aftermath of the 2015 Charlie Hebdo terror attack which left 12 dead, world leaders flocked to the streets of Paris and partook in an iconic unity march to condemn the terrorist attack.  But a march of another, relatively larger magnitude did occur -- and it was led by one woman. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern quickly became a symbol of solidarity with the slain Muslims of Christchurch. The nation's 38-year-old Prime Minister showed up for her people, for the victims and for their families in ways other leaders simply have not for their respective Muslim communities.  The admirable stances she took on behalf of the New Zealand Muslim community there have raised the bar for what principled leadership should look like today. And they have begun to change the global narrative of animus toward Islam and Muslims.  Ardern's firm and unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist nature of the attack stands in stark contrast with the narrative of those -- such as US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- who, in the past, have appeared to base part of their political platforms on inciting anti-Muslim sentiment and associating Islam with terrorism.  A member of the progressive Labour Party, Ardern decided to act fast and stand with the victims' families -- a decision which drew widespread global attention and won the respect and admiration of Muslims.  Sharing on Twitter the now-iconic photo of a somber Ardern in a black headscarf, which she donned the day after the attack as a sign of respect to Muslims, Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., wrote that Ardern ""reflects the type of sincere, people-oriented leadership that the world needs to evolve from its current chaotic state."" Indeed, Ardern's stances represent a far cry from the divisive tune of right-wing nationalist incitement against Islam and Muslims that has become all too normalized in global political discourse today.  Meanwhile, in the days since the shooting, Ardern has announced the ban of all military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles in New Zealand and visited Christchurch twice. In a parliamentary speech, she declared that she will not dignify the terrorist by ever mentioning his name, so as not to give in to his pitiful and evident thirst for publicity. Setting a uniting tone of anger, grief and solidarity for all of New Zealand, she implored her countrymen and women to ""speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them.""  Some might say it is easy to exhibit unifying and humanistic leadership in the aftershock of such a ghastly attack, especially in a peaceful country like New Zealand. One can easily criticize the pre-existing climate of microaggression and Islamophobia in New Zealand and Australia and ask what Ardern had done for the Muslim community before the attacks happened. Others have rightly questioned New Zealand's military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. These valid criticisms demand serious introspection and action on the part of Western politicians.  And although Ardern's leadership has just set a new bar for a more compassionate, responsible and inclusive response to instances when Muslims are the primary victims of mass violence, it still falls short. Such a narrative must also seriously ask what role the ""War on Terror""-- which has killed approximately half a million people in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan -- plays in the escalation of hate crimes , such as the Christchurch attack. Arden should use this moment to critique the ongoing military involvement by Western powers in Muslim-majority countries.  Ideally, Ardern's empathy would not be considered unique or novel, but amid the highly divisive, ""strong-man rhetoric"" so ubiquitous in world politics today, her stance is powerful and potentially game-changing.  She even told Trump (who the terrorist reportedly mentioned in his manifesto) that the best way the US could support New Zealanders during this difficult time is by offering ""sympathy and love for all Muslim communities."" This recommendation speaks volumes: her discourse on solidarity with Muslims possesses the power to extend itself beyond Christchurch to reach vulnerable Muslim communities in places like the USA, Europe, India, Myanmar and China.  On Friday, during the first weekly congregational prayer since the attack, Arden joined mourners for a two-minute silence for the slain after a national broadcast of the athan (the call to prayer), when she cited a moving hadith (saying) by the Prophet Muhammad.  Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook  In European countries, where prejudiced attitudes toward the hijab and the building of mosques are still rampant, the call of the athan nationwide is a symbolic stance against Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry . This and other gestures represent the best of what liberal progressive policies toward religious minorities can look like.  Ardern's moral leadership must signal to other leaders that their hardline political platforms -- built on waging war, imprisonment, surveillance, animosity and travel bans on Muslims -- only add fuel to the fire of extremism and incitement of violence against immigrants and Muslims worldwide.  It should not take a tragedy such as the Christchurch massacre to humanize Muslims. Still, Ardern's leadership can help counter anti-Muslim sentiment globally and begin to reverse destructive foreign policies in Muslim-majority countries. This type of leadership must become the norm -- not the exception.",en,terrorattack,,

Health alert  Measles is an airborne infection causing fever, coughing and rashes that can be deadly in rare cases.  It is more contagious than tuberculosis or Ebola, yet is easily preventable with a vaccine that costs pennies.  The UN says worldwide cases of measles jumped by more than 30% in 2017, and infections continued to rise last year.  Just 10 countries were responsible for the surge in cases in 2018, according to the UN children's agency.  While most of the countries that experienced large spikes in cases are beset by unrest or conflict, several wealthier nations also saw their caseloads soar.  No, MMR doesn't cause autism  In all, 98 countries reported more measles cases in 2018 compared with 2017. But the causes varied wildly.  The World Health Organization has warned that the growing anti-vaccine movement in richer nations constitutes a top-10 global health threat.  The phenomenon has adherents in several Western nations, including Britain and France, but is arguably most high profile in the US, where measles cases leapt 559% between 2017 and 2018.  ""Anti-vaxxers"" have for years cited a fraudulent 1998 study by discredited British researcher Andrew Wakefield that suggested a link between the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, and a risk of autism and bowel disease in children.  Repeated studies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the most recent involving more than 650,000 children monitored for more than a decade Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have shown that there is no such link.  The UN children's fund has warned that complacency and misinformation were driving the resurgence of measles among richer nations.  ""Measles may be the disease, but all too often the real infection is misinformation, mistrust and complacency,"" UNICEF head Henrietta Fore said this month.  Measles cases more than tripled across Europe in 2018, according to the WHO, with notable outbreaks in Romania, Italy and France.  Lack of access  In other parts of the world, many people lack access to the vaccines and clean sanitation needed to keep measles at bay.  The WHO recommends a 95% vaccination rate to prevent mass hospitalizations and fatalities.  At least 800 children have died from measles since September in Madagascar, where rampant malnutrition and a historically poor vaccine rate are driving the world's worse current outbreak.  Yemen also figures on UNICEF's ""top 10"" list of countries showing the largest increases in measles cases last year with a 316% hike, from 2,101 cases in 2017 to 8,742 cases in 2018.  Crisis-hit Venezuela, as well as areas of Brazil, have seen tens of thousands of confirmed measles cases since last year.  In the Philippines, where vaccine rates have been declining for years, measles cases jumped from 791 in 2017 to 5,120 last year. Twenty-five people died from measles in January alone.  And in Ukraine, which has experienced 5 years of simmering conflict with Russia on its eastern border region, more than 30,000 people have caught measles alone this year. At least 11 have died from the illness. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,diseas,,

Cyclone Idai smashed into Mozambique on March 15, unleashing hurricane-force winds and heavy rains that flooded much of the center of the country and then battered eastern Zimbabwe and Malawi.  The Red Cross has previously warned of a ""ticking bomb of disease"" and called for the deployment of medicines and health professionals to avert a full-blown health disaster.  ""We have 5 cases of cholera which have been confirmed. This is in Beira and the area around,"" the health official, Ussein Isse, told journalists, referring to the city which bore the brunt of the cyclone's force.  Cholera is a waterborne disease that thrives in conditions of poor hygiene and causes acute diarrhea that can prove fatal if untreated.  ""We were expecting cholera cases and we were prepared for this. We have put all the measures in place to try to mitigate the spread of cholera as much as we can,"" said Emma Batey, a coordinator at the COSACA emergency aid consortium.  Stagnant water, decomposing bodies and lack of sanitation in overcrowded shelters in Mozambique could create breeding grounds for typhus and malaria in addition to cholera, experts say.  ""There will be more cases because cholera is epidemic. When you have one case you can expect more. We are implementing preventive measures to limit the impact,"" added Isse.  UN humanitarian aid chief Mark Lowcock has appealed for $282 million (250 million euros) of relief aid over the next 3 months for Mozambique. (READ: Mozambique cyclone survivors face 'ticking bomb' of disease)  The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said roughly 3,125 square kilometers (1,200 square miles) of land had been swamped.  'Bringing help to families'  Nearly 3 million people across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe have been affected according to the WFP and 500,000 displaced.  More than 700 people have been killed in Mozambique and Zimbabwe and hundreds are missing, according to an Agence France-Presse toll compiled from figures provided by governments and UN agencies.  The International Organisation for Migration has said that Cyclone Idai and its aftermath ""could rank as the worst disaster to hit the region in decades.""  ""In Beira city...they have 5 cases of malaria and 100 cases of diarrhea. Soon we'll have more updates, but they are still receiving other (patients),"" said Isse.  ""So they are taking precautions of isolating those who have diarrhea...so it cannot spread.""  A long line of women in bright dresses waited under the baking sun in Estaquinha, 80 kilometers west of Beira, to receive emergency supplies from South African NGO Gift of the Givers Tuesday, March 26.  Environment Minister Celso Correia said around 170,000 people were living in government relief camps but insisted that conditions were improving.  ""Most of them already have doctors there and clean water and other means of assistance. The situation is getting better,"" he said alongside Isse at the media briefing.  ""The biggest challenge remains bringing help to families.""  Roads made impassable by flood water and debris are gradually being unblocked. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,diseas,,

In its first official comment, the government demanded an investigation and said it was closely watching rumours that the FBI had played a role.  On Wednesday a group committed to ousting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Cheollima Civil Defense, said it carried out the raid.  The group took computers and data and said it gave its evidence to the FBI.  At least two international arrest warrants have been issued for the main suspects.  ""A grave terrorist attack occurred on February 22, where an armed group assaulted the DPRK Embassy in Spain,"" a spokesman for the North's foreign ministry said in a statement.  What happened in the raid?  Spanish authorities say one of the group, named as Adrian Hong Chang, gained access by asking to see the commercial attachÃƒÂ©, whom he claimed to have met previously to discuss business matters. His accomplices burst in once he was inside.  The group are accused of interrogating the attachÃƒÂ© and trying to persuade him to defect. When he refused, they left him tied up in the basement.  Image copyright Google Maps Image caption The two-storey embassy has a swimming pool and lies to the north-west of central Madrid  Two other members of the break-in group were named as US citizen Sam Ryu, and a South Korean, Woo Ran Lee.  Embassy staff were held hostage for several hours. One woman managed to flee, escaping through a window and screaming for help. Concerned neighbours quickly called the police.  When officers arrived, they were greeted by Adrian Hong Chang, posing as a North Korean diplomat in a jacket with a Kim Jong-un lapel badge.  He told the police that all was well, and nothing had happened.  Most of the group later fled the embassy in three North Korean diplomatic vehicles. Mr Hong Chang and some others left later via the back entrance using another vehicle.  They split up into four groups and headed to Portugal. Mr Hong Chang - a Mexican citizen who lives in the US - allegedly contacted the FBI to give his version of events five days later.  What do we know about this group?  Cheollima Civil Defense (CDC), also known as Free Joseon, is committed to overthrowing North Korea's ruling Kim dynasty.  A video posted on its website and YouTube page purports to show one of the intruders smashing portraits of North Korea's communist leaders inside the Madrid embassy.  CDC first came to prominence after taking credit for getting Kim Jong-un's nephew, Kim Han-sol, safely out of Macau after the assassination of his father.  Kim Jong-nam - who was the North Korean leader's estranged half-brother - was murdered at an airport in Malaysia in 2017.  Kim Han-sol has expressed his desire to go back to North Korea, and has referred to his uncle as a ""dictator"".  What have authorities said about who is behind it?  Sources close to the investigation reportedly told Spanish newspaper El PaÃƒÂ­s that the operation was planned perfectly, as if by a ""military cell"".  The attackers seemed to know what they were looking for. Spanish authorities suspect US intelligence agencies and their allies could have been involved in the attack, according to El PaÃƒÂ­s and El Confidencial.  El PaÃƒÂ­s even reports that two of the group have links to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The CIA declined to comment to the BBC.  The US has denied any involvement in the raid.  Why would anyone attack the embassy?  Reports say the attackers could have been looking for information on North Korea's former ambassador to Madrid, Kim Hyok-chol, who was expelled from Spain in September 2017 over North Korea's nuclear testing programme.

2721890,foxnews,None,Afghans recruited by Iran for Syria war return home pariahs,https://www.foxnews.com/world/afghans-recruited-by-iran-for-syria-war-return-home-pariahs,,31/3/2019 20:30,"next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  Too poor to even buy pens and notebooks for school, Mehdi left his home in Afghanistan soon after his 17th birthday and headed to Iran, hoping to make his way to Europe and find work. He never made it there.  Instead, Mehdi ended up fighting in Syria's civil war, a conflict he had nothing to do with, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from his home. He was one of tens of thousands of Afghans recruited, paid and trained by Iran to fight in support of Tehran's ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad. There, he found himself thrown into one of the war's bloodiest front lines, surrounded by the bodies of his comrades, under fire from Islamic militants so close he could hear their shouts of ""Allahu akbar"" before each mortar blast.  Iran ran an extensive drive to bring Shiites from across the region and create a network of militias to help save Assad from the uprising against his rule Ã¢â‚¬â€ not only Afghans but also Pakistanis, Iraqis and Lebanese. Now with the 8-year war in Syria winding down, the question is what will Tehran do with those well-trained, well-armed forces.  Mehdi and other soldiers-for-hire from Afghanistan's impoverished Shiite Muslim communities are returning to their homeland, where they are met with suspicion. Afghan security officials believe Iran is still organizing them, this time as a secret army to spread Tehran's influence amid Afghanistan's unending conflicts.  ""Here in Afghanistan we are afraid. They say we are all terrorists,"" said Mehdi, now 21 and back in his home city of Herat. He was terrified, speaking on condition he not be fully identified for fear of retaliation against him. He wouldn't meet The Associated Press at home or in public Ã¢â‚¬â€ only in a car parked in a remote, mostly Shiite neighborhood. Even there, Mehdi kept his face obscured with a scarf, glancing suspiciously at every passing car.  Afghan veterans returning from Syria are threatened from multiple sides. They face arrest by security agencies that view them as traitors. And they face violence from the brutal Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, which views Shiites as heretics and vows to kill them. Last May, IS gunmen burst into Herat's Jawadia Shiite mosque, opening fire and setting off their suicide belt explosives among worshippers, killing 38 people.  Just knowing people who fought in Syria can land someone in jail, said a local elder in a village near Herat. He spoke on condition of anonymity for that reason. Eight men from his village were killed fighting in Syria, but there are no graves for them here. All were buried in Iran, he said.  Iran intensified its role in Syria when Assad appeared to be losing the fight against rebels in 2013 and 2014. Tehran sent hundreds of Revolutionary Guard troops and began bringing in allied militias. The most well-known and most powerful was Lebanon's Hezbollah.  But the largest was the force made up of Afghans, known as the Fatimiyoun Brigade, which experts have estimated numbered up to 15,000 fighters at any one time.  Over the years, several tens of thousands of Afghans likely trained and fought in it. Most of them are from Afghanistan's ethnic Hazara minority, who are among the country's poorest.  Roughly 10,000 veterans of the brigade have returned to Afghanistan, says a senior official in Afghanistan's Interior Ministry, who is familiar with government intelligence and spoke on condition of anonymity.  The Afghan government and many experts believe Iran could mobilize these ex-fighters once more to assert its influence in Afghanistan, particularly as the United States accelerates its efforts to end its nearly 18-year military intervention.  ""Expect the Iranians to reconstitute their militias inside Afghanistan at some point,"" warned Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal, a site devoted to coverage of the U.S. war on terror. ""Iran does not discard assets in which it invests time, treasure and expertise.""  Afghanistan is already tormented by an overabundance of armed groups, many divided on ethnic lines. They include militias loyal to the many warlords, who are aligned with the government but often at odds with each other. There are also the Sunni militants: Taliban insurgents rule in nearly half the country, and the Islamic State group affiliate has proven to be a stubborn enemy, even in the face of relentless U.S. bombing raids.  All those factions could turn their massive arsenals on each other after a U.S. and NATO withdrawal. It has happened before. In the early 1990s, factions of the U.S.-backed mujahedeen who took power after the Soviet withdrawal turned on each other in fighting that leveled large parts of the capital, Kabul, and killed an estimated 50,000 people.  Iran will likely seize on any turmoil to mobilize the Fatimiyoun with the very real pretext that Afghan Shiites need a defender, said Michael Kugelman, Asia Program deputy director at the Washington-based Wilson Center.  If Afghanistan is plunged into more unrest, ""the Iranians would have a strong motivation to help a Shia force that would face intensified threats from the Taliban and especially ISIS,"" he said, using an alternate abbreviation for the Islamic State group.  Iran is already supporting Syria war veterans living in Kabul and in central Afghanistan's Hazara-dominated region of Bamiyan, said the Interior Ministry official. He said Afghan intelligence agencies have identified senior Iranian government officials who are ""managing the activities"" of returning fighters, including providing them arms and money and building a structure for quick re-mobilization if needed. Afghan warlord Abdul Gani Alipur, an ethnic Hazara, is also implicated in aiding Iran, he said. Alipur was arrested late last year on charges of having an illegal militia, but he was released after thousands of Hazaras protested.  Most of those who joined the Fatimiyoun Brigade were driven by hopelessness and poverty, not loyalty to Iran, said Reza Kasimi, a researcher with the independent Kabul-based research group, Afghanistan Analysts Network.  ""The first thing is that most of these people don't see a future for themselves in Afghanistan,"" he said.  When Mehdi went to Iran in 2015, he worked, mostly on construction sites, to earn enough money to make a run for Europe. But by the time he did, Europe's borders had closed.  ""I was very disappointed. I had come to Iran to go to Europe, to study, to have a better life, but I was still there, with nothing,"" Mehdi said.  An Afghan friend suggested they enlist for Syria. As a fighter for Iran, they could earn the equivalent of $900 a month. At the time Mehdi was making barely $150 a month.  ""I thought about it and I made my heart strong, like a raging river,"" Mehdi said. ""I decided, 'Live or die, I'll go'.""  They reported to a recruitment center in Tehran. There, officials gathered his personal details Ã¢â‚¬â€ names of his parents and relatives and the street where he lived in Herat. ""I understood they wanted all that information if I died,"" he said.  He and other Afghan recruits were flown the next day to Iran's southern Yazd province, where they underwent 27 days of training under the Revolutionary Guard. Mehdi's marksmanship impressed the trainers and he was made a sniper. When it was over, Mehdi was flown to Damascus with around 1,600 other new recruits.  In Damascus, the recruits opened bank accounts where their salary would be deposited. They were taken to the shrine of Sayeda Zeinab, a site outside Damascus revered by Shiites, for final blessings before battle. The next day, they were taken by bus to the northern city of Aleppo and sent immediately to the front.  There, Mehdi was thrown into one of the fiercest battles of the war Ã¢â‚¬â€ a campaign that began in the spring of 2016 against Islamic militant factions, including the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, over the town of Khan Toman and nearby villages on Aleppo's edge.  It was a fight that showed the international nature of the war. Among the militants were Syrians, Iraqis, Chechens, Turkmens, Uzbeks and other foreign jihadis; on the other side were Syrian government troops, Iranian soldiers, Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, Iraqi Shiites and Afghans, backed by Russian warplanes Ã¢â‚¬â€ all battling for a piece of Syrian land.  The fighting went on for months and it is estimated hundreds on both sides were killed or wounded. On a single day, militants killed an estimated 80 pro-government fighters, including at last 13 Iranians and dozens of Afghans, Iraqis and Lebanese. In the end, the militants held control of Khan Toman, as they do to this day.  Mehdi described terrifying bloodshed. He said in one battle, 800 Afghans were sent to the front line and only 200 returned alive and unwounded. ""Often in the morning I saw seven, eight dead bodies."" he said. ""For the first couple of days I was very scared. The explosions were so loud.""  Another Afghan veteran of the same battle, Abdullah, said he still has nightmares of the dead, their limbs missing. He said the Afghans were sent as cannon fodder. ""I saw Afghan fighters rolled over by tanks the way someone steps on ants,"" he told the AP in Kabul. ""Dead bodies were scattered everywhere.""  Mehdi returned to Afghanistan a year ago, and his life has changed little from when he left. He remains dirt poor and unable to find a job.  After nearly 18 years and more than $1 trillion spent by the United States, Afghans are only getting poorer. According to a 2016-17 Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey, co-sponsored by the European Union, 55 percent of Afghans live below the poverty level, compared to 38 percent in 2011-12.  Mehdi spoke bitterly of his lack of options. He's considering re-enlisting for Syria.

The unnamed 18-year-old visited the emergency room in India after suffering violent seizures after parasites spread to his brain.  His parents told doctors in Faridabad, India, that he had experienced pain in the right side of his groin for a week.  On physical examination, he had swelling over his right eye, a tender right testicle and was confused, according to a case study in the New England Journal of Medicine.  An MRI scan of his head showed there were white spots all over his brain.

Doctors also found cysts in the patient's eye and testis.  The cysts caused damage in his cerebral cortex - the outer mantle of brain tissue - as well as the brain stem including the cerebellum at the back of the head.  Image: Pigs become infected by eating the tapeworm eggs in human faeces infected with a tapeworm  The man was diagnosed with neurocysticerosis, which is a special form of cysticerosis - the tissue infection caused by the young form of tapeworm - that affects the brain.  Doctors prescribed him steroids and antibiotics, but he died two weeks later.  A person can get the condition by eating food or drinking water contaminated with eggs found in the faeces of another person who has intestinal tapeworm, and it is not infectious.  The larvae crawl out of the eggs and form cysts into the muscle and brain tissues.  Image: Bulls feed on garbage on a roadside in Faridabad, India  It can cause neurological symptoms and is one of the most common causes of seizures in developing countries.  Both the tapeworm infection, also known as taeniasis, and cysticercosis occur globally, with the highest rates of infection in areas of Latin America, Asia and Africa that have poor sanitation and free-ranging pigs that have access to human faeces.  You cannot get cysticercosis simply by eating undercooked pork, however eating undercooked pork that contains larval cysts can result in intestinal tapeworm.

2745312,bbci,Prof Helen Bedford University College London,Measles: How a preventable disease returned from the past,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47800438,,5/4/2019 16:06,"Image copyright Getty Images  Measles is one of the world's most infectious illnesses but until recently cases had been declining. So what's led to recent outbreaks?  Rockland County, in New York state, declared a state of emergency last week following a severe re-emergence of the preventable virus.  It's far from an isolated case, with the US already on course this year to see the most measles cases since 2000, when the disease was officially eliminated.  Other countries, such as Mexico, France and Madagascar, have seen similar outbreaks in communities with gaps in immunity.  In most cases, measles is relatively minor but it can also lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as pneumonia, meningitis and brain inflammation.  Although still far below historical levels, the disease has been on the rise for several years. Reported cases rose by 31% in 2017 on the year before, leading to about 110,000 deaths worldwide.  According to Unicef, 98 countries reported an increase in measles cases in 2018, with almost three-quarters of these occurring in 10 countries.  What's happening to vaccinations?  Successful vaccination programmes have ensured measles has become rare in many places.  When a measles vaccine became widely used in the 1980s, cases fell significantly, eventually leading some countries to declare it had been eliminated.  Before then, large epidemics of measles occurred every few years.  For example, in 1967, the year before measles vaccine was introduced in England and Wales, there were almost half a million reported cases and 99 deaths. By 1998, this had fallen to an all-time low of 56 cases and no deaths.  So what accounts for the alarming recent increases?  A vaccination target of 95% creates ""herd immunity"" in a community, to prevent this highly infectious disease from spreading.  All the measles outbreaks have taken hold in areas where there is not enough immunity but the reasons behind this differ from place to place.  The high-profile anti-vaccination movement has become influential in parts of the US and Europe.  Despite overwhelming scientific evidence supporting vaccination, ""anti-vaxxers"" can believe vaccines are unnecessary or harmful.  They sometimes embrace conspiracy theories around ""big pharma"" and are distrustful of government.  In the UK, a scare over the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, following now discredited research, had a major impact for a time.  In 2004, first-dose MMR coverage fell to 80% in England and 78% in Wales  Two decades on, uptake has recovered, with over 90% of UK two-year-olds receiving the vaccine in 2017-18.  But many adolescents and young adults not given the MMR as infants are now catching measles.  We may also see future outbreaks of rubella - German measles - in this age group, a particular concern as they reach childbearing age.  Usually a mild disease, rubella can be catastrophic if caught in the early stages of pregnancy, causing serious vision, hearing, heart and learning problems in the unborn baby.  Beyond 'anti-vaxxers'  In other countries, reasons behind falling vaccination rates are very different.  In Ukraine, for example, public trust in vaccination was severely shaken in 2008, following the death of a teenager after a measles vaccination, which, although unconnected, led the government to halt the vaccination campaign.  By 2016, in a situation made worse by political unrest, health service corruption and vaccine shortages, Ukraine had one of the lowest uptakes of measles vaccine in the world, with only one in three of six-year-old children protected with two doses of vaccine.  Although over 90% of six-year-olds are now protected, the reservoir of young people left unprotected has allowed measles to take hold.  The country has become a hotspot for measles, with 54,000 cases in 2018, compared with about 5,000 in the previous year.  Immunity levels have also fallen in countries where the health system has collapsed, such as Yemen, which is in the midst of civil war, and Venezuela, which tackling a serious economic crisis.  This can have knock-on effects on other countries too, such as in Brazil, which has experienced mass migration from Venezuela.  What is measles?  Measles is a highly infectious virus spread in droplets from coughs, sneezes or direct contact  It can hang in the air or remain on surfaces for hours  Measles often starts with fever, feeling unwell, sore eyes and a cough followed by a rising fever and rash  At its mildest, measles makes children feel very miserable, with recovery in seven-10 days - but complications, including ear infections, seizures, diarrhoea, pneumonia and brain inflammation, are common  The disease is more severe in the very young, in adults and in people with immunity problems  Measles is still a major cause of child death in many low-income countries, although the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented more than 20 million deaths in 2000-17  How are countries responding to these outbreaks?  Some countries are moving toward mandatory vaccination and many more have tightened up existing requirements.  Italy and France have extended existing requirements with fines and restricted school attendance. And Germany is currently discussing making measles vaccine mandatory.  In New York's Rockland County, unvaccinated children have been banned from public places for 30 days. But it is difficult to see how this could be effectively enforced and there is little evidence that mandatory vaccination is always the best approach.  Those determined to not vaccinate will find a way round the system, for example by home-schooling or paying a fine.  Meanwhile, parents on the fence about vaccination may become more resistant if they feel they are not being given a choice. A better solution may be the opportunity to have a conversation with a health professional to respond to their concerns.  More like this  Meanwhile, checking vaccination status on entry to nursery and then to school would act as a useful reminder to parents and reinforce their importance.  As most under-immunisation results from difficulties accessing services, tailored immunisation services would also be helpful.  For example, an innovative response to a measles outbreak in the London borough of Hackney was the ""spotty bus"" - a mobile immunisation unit that toured the neighbourhood, parking in school playgrounds and supermarket car parks, vaccinating almost 1,000 children whose parents simply needed easier access to immunisation services.  It is not enough for health services to expect parents to come to them.  Taking a proactive approach and offering these kinds of easily accessible vaccine programmes would help to prevent further outbreaks.  Since the global fall in vaccination rates mainly stems from practical or logistical issues, it is often more important to have an everything in place for a successful vaccination programme.  This means having enough vaccines to go around, via services that are well organised, easy to access and supported by government efforts to increase public trust in vaccination.

The army-run Myawady newspaper said the villagers were Ã¢â‚¬Å“together with terrorists while the army was cracking down on the Arakan ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terrorist activitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â on Wednesday in the township of Buthidaung.  Rakhine state came to global attention in 2017, when the Myanmar army drove about 730,000 ethnic Rohingya across the border into neighbouring Bangladesh, following attacks by Rohingya insurgents on police posts.  The United Nations has accused the army of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgenocidal intentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in cracking down on the Muslim minority.  More recently, the military has been battling another armed group, the Arakan Army, which draws recruits mostly from the ethnic Rakhine population.  The men were collecting bamboo near the Sai Din waterfall when an army helicopter attacked, three villagers and a regional lawmaker told Reuters on Thursday.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“All of them were bamboo workers,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Soe Tun Oo, a fellow labourer.  Arakan Army spokesman Khin Thu Kha denied the dead and wounded men were members of the armed group, saying the military had attacked indiscriminately.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They bombed everywhere, believing there were Arakan Army members in the jungle,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  Ten people are being treated at the Buthidaung public hospital, Kyaw Min Tun, a hospital official, said on Friday.  In a statement, the military said nine injured were taken to a military-run hospital for treatment.  But a military spokesman, Tun Tun Nyi, declined to comment on the discrepancy between the accounts.  More than 17,000 people have been displaced by the violence in Rakhine since December, the U.S. embassy said, urging urged authorities to allow humanitarian relief for those affected.

2756639,bangkokpost,Bangkok Post Public Company Limited,Escalating Libya conflict prompts international alarm,https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/1658088/escalating-libya-conflict-prompts-international-alarm,,7/4/2019 22:15,"TRIPOLI - The military conflict shaking Libya escalated Sunday as forces of strongman Khalifa Haftar launched an air strike on a suburb of Tripoli and the UN-backed government vowed a major counteroffensive.  Forces loyal to Libya's UN-backed unity government have sent reinforcements to push back an advance on Tripoli by fighters of strongman Khalifa Haftar  The United Nations called for an urgent two-hour truce for the southern outskirts of the capital to allow evacuations of civilians and the wounded.  Rivalries between the two camps threaten to plunge the country into a full-blown civil war after Haftar on Thursday launched an offensive on Tripoli.  Oil-rich Libya has been riven by chaos since the NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi, with rival administrations and armed groups vying for power.  Repeated attempts to find a peaceful solution have failed.  After a pause overnight, fierce fighting flared anew on Sunday morning south of the capital between Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) and forces backing the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).  As clashes raged in the mainly farmland region of Wadi Raba and the disused international airport south of the capital, a spokesman for pro-GNA forces said a ""counteroffensive"" had been launched to push back Haftar's forces.  Colonel Mohamed Gnounou told reporters that operation ""Volcano of Anger"" was aimed at ""purging all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces"", in reference to Haftar fighters.  The LNA meanwhile announced it had carried out its first air raid on a Tripoli suburb, despite calls by the international community to halt hostilities.  GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj warned on Saturday of a ""war without a winner"" and said that reinforcements were pouring into Tripoli from several regions.  Powerful armed groups from the western city of Misrata and fighters from Zentan and Zawiya -- all battle-hardened militiamen who took part in the 2011 uprising that toppled Kadhafi -- have joined the battle.  At least one armed group from Misrata known as Brigade 166 arrived Saturday in eastern Tripoli with dozens of vehicles, some mounted with anti-aircraft guns, to join the counter-offensive, an AFP photographer said.  ""We are waiting for orders to repel any advance by the enemy towards Tripoli,"" said the group's spokesman Khaled Abu Jazia.  Misrata fighters ousted the Islamic State group from Libya's coastal city of Sirte, Kadhafi's hometown, in 2016 after months of bitter fighting.  Sunday's LNA air raid came a day after forces backing the GNA launched air strikes on their rivals for the first time since the offensive began, with at least one targeting an LNA position south of Tripoli.  - 'Protracted war' -  LNA spokesman Ahmed Mesmari had vowed the force would retaliate.  On Saturday he said pro-Haftar fighters were ""progressing on several fronts... as planned"" and that Tripoli would soon be captured.  Analysts say Haftar has been buoyed by a series of successful military operations that have brought all of the east and much of the south of Libya under his control.  A field marshal who served under Kadhafi and now backs an administration in eastern Libya opposed to the GNA, Haftar was counting on a swift battle to capture Tripoli but some experts say he miscalculated.  ""To date, Haftar's operation has mostly failed to go according to plan, and it has now galvanised western Libyan forces against him,"" said analyst Wolfram Lacher.  ""He now faces the prospect of a protracted war south of Tripoli, or of a decisive defeat,"" said Lacher, a researcher with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).  As the tension mounted, Tripoli residents were seen Saturday queueing outside petrol stations and supermarkets.  - UN peace efforts -  Haftar's offensive came as UN chief Antonio Guterres visited Libya Thursday days ahead of a planned UN-backed conference aimed at uniting Libya's rivals and paving the way for elections.  The UN Security Council has called on Haftar's forces to halt their advance, warning it was putting Libya's shaky stability at further risk.  But UN envoy Ghassan Salame insisted on Saturday the April 14-16 conference would go ahead.  ""We are determined"" to hold the talks, he said.  Sarraj said the conference was meant to pave the way for a ""stable"" government and accused Haftar of ""betraying"" an agreement reached during a meeting in February to push for elections and a new unity government before year's end.  Haftar is ""motivated by personal interests and his own delusions"" and is trying to ""plunge the country into a cycle of violence"", said Sarraj.  On Saturday Haftar chaired a meeting with the parallel Libyan administration based in the east of the country to discuss a ""security plan"" for Tripoli that would be implemented at the end of the assault, his media office said.",en,terrorattack,645,['Libya']

Pakistan has repeatedly denied that it lost an F-16 over the skies in Kashmir while a US magazine, citing top defence officials, has also cast doubt on IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assertion that a jet was shot down.  India lost an MiG-21 Bison in the aerial skirmish and its pilot was captured by Pakistan and later returned, cooling one of the most serious military confrontations between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades.  But India has long maintained that its pilot first fired on an F-16, sending the damaged jet crashing into Pakistan-administered Kashmir Ã¢â‚¬â€œ something Islamabad says never happened.  In a press conference Air Vice Marshal R.G.K Kapoor repeated this assertion, reading out the evidence gathered by India and displaying radar images he said proved the Pakistan jet was struck and crashed.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is no doubt that two aircraft went down in the aerial engagement on February 27, 2019,Ã¢â‚¬Â Kapoor said Monday, reading from a prepared statement.  IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s air force Ã¢â‚¬Å“has irrefutable evidence of not only the fact that F-16 was usedÃ¢â‚¬Â on the day of the dogfight, but that it was shot down by the Indian jet, he added.  Kapoor said further Ã¢â‚¬Å“credible information and evidenceÃ¢â‚¬Â backed this version of events but could not be released due to confidentiality concerns.  It comes just days after Foreign Policy magazine cited two unnamed senior US defence officials who said that US personnel recently conducted a count of PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s F-16s and found none missing.  The magazine quoted one of the officials as saying that Pakistan invited the US to physically count its F-16 fleet.  The dogfight happened after Pakistani aircraft entered Indian airspace a day after Indian aircraft carried out an airstrike on what it said was a Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorist training campÃ¢â‚¬Â in Pakistan.  That in turn was in response to a suicide bombing on February 14 in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 40 Indian troops and which was claimed by a militant group based in Pakistan.  Doubt has also been cast over the success of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s airstrike, which Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has claimed killed 250.  Pakistan denied that there was any damage or casualties.  Independent reporting by multiple local and international outlets who visited the site also found no evidence of a major terrorist training camp Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or of any infrastructure damage at all.  Pakistan said it shot down two Indian planes and lost none of its own, but India said that it lost only one aircraft.  Initially Pakistan said it had captured two Indian pilots but the military later clarified it had just one pilot in custody.    ",en,terrorattack,,

They were given access to an Islamic school in Balakot, where Indian media say militants were killed in retaliation for an attack in Kashmir.  The large building appeared to be fully intact and the Pakistani army denied it had been used as a terror camp.  The visit to the school was held on the eve of a general election in India.  Pakistan and India have been engaged in an information war over the Balakot site, where Pakistan says the bombs on 26 February landed in an empty area and hurt no-one.  India insists it killed a large number of Jaish-e-Mohamed group militants and destroyed their camp in retaliation for a suicide attack two weeks earlier in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 40 paramilitary police troopers.  That attack was the deadliest against Indian forces in Kashmir in decades and raised fears of a new war between India and Pakistan, which are both nuclear powers.

The large hilltop building is said to have capacity for 2,500 children.  Pakistani army spokesman Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor insisted the madrassa did ""no harm"" and that Indian allegations that it was a terror training camp had ""no truth"".  Some 150-200 children could be seen reciting the Koran in a mosque at the school.  However, a teacher and a student interviewed by the BBC said they were all local people and that the madrassa had been shut since the Indian attack.  While the media were allowed to take interviews they were told to keep them short and it was clear that the tour was being restricted.  What does India say?  Contacted by the BBC, India's external affairs ministry said it stood by its statement last month that the ""counter-terrorism strike of 26 February"" had ""achieved the intended objective"".

REUTERS/Stringer  The downfall of Bashir follows the toppling this month of Algerian strongman Abdelaziz Bouteflika, also following mass protests after three decades in power.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Government sources and the minister of production and economic resources in North Darfur, Adel Mahjoub Hussein, told Dubai-based al-Hadath TV that Bashir's presidency was over and consultations were being held on creating a ruling military council. Early on Thursday morning, state television said the military would make an announcement soon. But hours later no statement had been issued, amid reports of differences about the make-up of the transitional council.  MILITARY RULE AGAIN?  Names that have been circulating include Vice President and Defence Minister Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf, an ex-military intelligence chief, also an Islamist, and former army chief of staff Emad al-Din Adawi.  Adawi is said to be favoured by regional neighbours at odds with Bashir over his Islamist leanings.  Thousands of people flocked to an anti-government protest outside the ministry on Thursday, while huge crowds took to the streets in central Khartoum, dancing and shouting anti-Bashir slogans. Protesters chanted: ""It has fallen, we won.""  Demonstrators called for a civilian government and said they would not accept an administration led by military and security figures, or by Bashir's aides.  Omar Saleh Sennar, a senior member of the Sudanese Professionals' Association, one of the main protest groups, said it was waiting for the army statement and expected to negotiate with the military over a transfer of power from Bashir. ""We will only accept a transitional civilian government,"" Sennar told Reuters.

REUTERS/Stringer  Kamal Omar, 38, another demonstrator, said: ""We will continue our sit-in until we prevail.""  Some demonstrators, who have rallied against Bashir since Dec. 19, said they feared the delay would allow him to go into exile.    Troops deployed around the defence ministry and on major roads and bridges in the capital.  Soldiers stormed the headquarters of Bashir's Islamic Movement, the main component of the ruling National Congress Party. Protesters also attacked the offices of Sudan's intelligence and security service in the eastern cities of Port Sudan and Kassala on Thursday, witnesses said.  FATE UNCLEAR  Bashir, a former paratrooper who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1989, has been a divisive figure who has managed his way through one internal crisis after another while withstanding attempts by the West to weaken him.  Sudan has suffered prolonged periods of isolation since 1993, when the United States added BashirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government to its list of terrorism sponsors for harbouring Islamist militants. Washington followed up with sanctions four years later.  The latest crisis has escalated since the weekend, when thousands of demonstrators began camping out outside the defence ministry compound, where Bashir's residence is located.  Clashes erupted on Tuesday between soldiers trying to protect the protesters and intelligence and security personnel trying to disperse them. At least 11 people died, including six members of the armed forces, the information minister said, citing a police report.  Since December, Sudan has been rocked by persistent protests sparked by the government's attempt to raise the price of bread, and an economic crisis that has led to fuel and cash shortages",en,terrorattack,,

Launched by George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans, the war in Afghanistan, known as Operation Enduring Freedom, had Al Qaeda and the Taliban as its original targets.  By 2011, there were about 140,000 foreign troops serving in Afghanistan, although that number has now dropped significantly. There are still 14,000 American troops serving in Afghanistan.  One of the initial goals, capturing 9/11 terrorist mastermind Usama bin Laden, proved to be extremely challenging.  US-TALIBAN PEACE DEAL WOULD DISHONOR 9/11 VICTIMS AND TROOPS WHO LOST LIVES, SENIOR AFGHAN OFFICIAL SAYS  Although the first democratic elections in Afghanistan since the Taliban's fall were held in October 2004, the fighting continued as the Taliban regrouped and changed its tactics.  Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan, who will be reporting from Afghanistan this week, interviewed Hamid Karzai, who would go on to serve as the country's president for a decade: ""[Bin Laden's] a criminal. He's killed thousands of our people. He's ruined our lives. If we catch him, he will be given over to international justice.""  ""Yes, the enemy will attack people in the government, yes they'll try to figure out how to get suicide car bombs in here, yes they'll try to increase their ability to move against the border outposts, but nowhere in any of this can they derail the process,"" former U.S. Central Command commander John Abizaid told Fox News' Bret Baier before the 2004 election.  After President Obama was elected in 2008, he pushed to add resources to parts of Afghanistan where American casualties were increasing. The U.S. presence in the country peaked at 100,000 when the war was in its 10th year. Although the U.S. and NATO forces formally ended their combat missions in Afghanistan on December 28, 2014, there have been numerous deadly incidents since then.  Three U.S. Marines were killed on Monday in an IED blast while in a convoy near Bagram Airfield. The first Marines killed in combat in over three years, they were from the 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Marine Forces Reserve: Staff Sgt. Christopher Slutman, 43, Cpl. Robert A. Hendriks, 25, Sgt. Benjamin S. Hines, 31.  3 MARINES KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN IDENTIFIED, INCLUDED FDNY FIREFIGHTER  U.S. soldiers, working with Afghan forces, are now battling a resurgent Taliban in some parts of the war-torn country and an Islamic State affiliate that has tried to expand its footprint.  The prospects for a peace deal are at a difficult stage.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It would be a shame if a deal was made with the terrorists who killed more than 5,400 Americans, and if they were given control of the lives of the Afghan people. That would be a win for those terrorists,Ã¢â‚¬Â Hamdullah Mohib, the National Security Adviser of Afghanistan (NSA) who previously served as the Ambassador to the United States, told Fox News on a recent visit to the U.N. Mission in New York.

Sudan plays a key role in the regional interests of Saudi Arabia and its allies, siding with Riyadh against Shiite Iran and providing troops in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in the Yemen war.  And after weeks of silence on SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political turmoil, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Sunday released a lukewarm reaction to BashirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toppling, calling for Ã¢â‚¬Å“stabilityÃ¢â‚¬Â and a Ã¢â‚¬Å“peaceful transitionÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are by nature averse to all popular movements or revolutions,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Karim Bitar, director of research at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“These are powers that largely privilege the status quo. They fear that any effervescence, any national protest movement, will lead to an oil slick Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that there will be contagion.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Change is inevitable  Tens of thousands have protested outside SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army headquarters since April 6, initially to urge the military to back their demand that Bashir be removed.  Thousands have remained encamped there to keep up the pressure on a military council that took power after ending BashirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three-decade rule on Thursday.  Saudi Arabia and the UAE have both voiced backing for the transitional council, with Riyadh promising an aid package to the people of Sudan Ã¢â‚¬Å“in order to alleviate sufferingÃ¢â‚¬Â, according to a statement published by state news agency SPA.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Gulf states are watching Sudan with apprehension and will do everything possible to ensure that the transition happens in continuity, meaning that Sudan remains under military control,Ã¢â‚¬Â Bitar told AFP.  Bashir, who ruled Sudan with an iron fist for nearly 30 years, broke ranks with Saudi ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regional arch-nemesis Iran after RiyadhÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intervention in the Yemen war, sending much-needed troops to battle rebels linked to Tehran alongside the Saudi-led coalition.  General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has risen as the head of the transitional council Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a move analysts say is not unwelcome in some Gulf states.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“All sides in the Gulf want to maintain some sort of stability,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Andreas Krieg, a professor at KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s College London.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burhan has no ties to the Islamist deep state and has been one of the main liaisons of Sudan to the UAE during the Yemen war.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burhan appears to be more prone to accept the UAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s policy of zero tolerance towards political Islam than others.Ã¢â‚¬Â  As Sudan looks to the future, the Gulf monarchies are watching closely.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Gulf states donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want a violent transfer of power. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want another tragedy like Libya, Syria or Iraq,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mustafa Alani of the Geneva-based Gulf Research Center.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The only way is a peaceful transfer of power,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“In Sudan and Algeria, change is inevitable. The military institutions will supervise the change and hand over power to the civilians.Ã¢â‚¬Â  QatarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complicated role  One Gulf state that has remained silent on the Sudan protests is Qatar, locked in a nearly two-year-old diplomatic standoff with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt.  Riyadh and its allies severed all ties with Qatar on accusations the emirate was too close to Iran and to Sunni extremists including the Taliban and Muslim Brotherhood.  Gas-rich Qatar had wielded some influence over BashirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime before Khartoum joined ranks with Riyadh in the Yemen war.  With Bashir gone, it remains to be seen whether Sudan will continue to fight in Yemen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and whether Doha will support the new government.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Qatar has its own reasons to object because it had some sort of influence on the previous regime,Ã¢â‚¬Â Alani said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Qatar has an objective of supporting Islamists in power because they have some sort of influence over this sort of regime.Ã¢â‚¬Â  And while Qatar has Ã¢â‚¬Å“a tendency to support opposition movements,Ã¢â‚¬Â the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historic proximity to the Bashir regime leaves it in an uncomfortable position in the interim, according to Bitar.  But across the board, BashirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ouster is a pivotal moment for the Gulf.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“One shared goal across Gulf states is maintaining SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stability Ã¢â‚¬â€œ preserving the institutions of the state while reform and transition takes place,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Elizabeth Dickinson of the International Crisis Group.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are not in the Gulf of 2011, completely allergic to transition,Ã¢â‚¬Â Dickinson told AFP.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leaders here understand that autocratic governments that do not perform cannot survive. The question is how they should fail.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“With so much fragility across the greater region, there is a sense here that a managed transition could be the best way forward.Ã¢â‚¬Â    ",en,terrorattack,658,"['Sudan', 'Sudan']"

With the Islamic State having recently lost its last patch of territory in Syria, he said, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign fighters are now more likely to return home to Sri Lanka and other countries.

Initial efforts by small, homegrown extremist groups are usually marked by some degree of failure. Some of the bombs fail to detonate entirely.

Flags were lowered to half mast on government buildings, and people bowed their heads and reflected silently on the violence that has caused international outrage.

President Maithripala Sirisena's said there was intelligence that ""international terror groups"" were ""behind local terrorists"" and that he would seek foreign help to investigate.  The state of emergency, which gave police and the military special powers to counter militant strikes, came into force at midnight. Suspects can be detained without a court order.  A second straight night-time curfew was also put in place, but lifted before dawn.  Officials are also investigating why more precautions were not taken after an Apr 11 warning from Sri Lanka's police that a ""foreign intelligence agency"" had reported the NTJ planned suicide attacks on churches.  Senaratne said that warning was not passed on to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe or other top ministers.  TENSIONS HIGH  Tensions remained high and security heavy after a bomb discovered by police on Monday near one of the targeted churches blew up before police could defuse it. Although there was a powerful blast, no injuries were reported.    Police also found 87 bomb detonators at a Colombo bus station.  Details have begun to emerge about some of the foreigners killed in the blasts.  The United States reported at least four Americans killed - including a child - and the Netherlands raised their toll to three.  A Danish billionaire lost three of his children in the attacks, a spokesman for his company said.  Eight Britons, eight Indians and nationals from Turkey, Australia, France, Japan and Portugal, were also killed, according to Sri Lankan officials and foreign governments.

No group has claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks, which officials said were carried out by at least seven suicide bombers, on three churches and four hotels. The toll rose to 321 dead with about 500 people wounded.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The initial investigation has revealed that this was in retaliation for the New Zealand mosque attack,Ã¢â‚¬Â junior minister for defence Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament.  He did not elaborate on why authorities believed there was a link to the killing of 50 people at two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch during Friday prayers on March 15. A lone gunman carried out those attacks.  Wijewardene said two Sri Lankan Islamist groups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the National Thawheed JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ut and Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were responsible for the blasts early on Sunday during Easter services and as high-end hotels served breakfast.  US intelligence sources said the attacks carried some of the hallmarks of the Islamic State militant group, although they were cautious because it had not claimed responsibility.  Islamic State is usually quick to claim responsibility for, or links to, attacks against foreign targets or religious groups, whether it was involved or not, they said.  Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament investigators were looking into foreign links.  Earlier on Tuesday, Sri Lankan government and military sources said a Syrian had been detained among 40 people being questioned over the bombs.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He was arrested after the interrogation of local suspects,Ã¢â‚¬Â one of the sources said, referring to the unidentified Syrian.  Funerals  Tuesday was declared a national day of mourning and the funerals of some of the victims were held, as pressure mounted on the government over why effective action had not been taken in response to a warning this month about a possible attack on churches by the little-known National Thawheed JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ut group.  The first six attacks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on three churches and three luxury hotels Ã¢â‚¬â€œ came within 20 minutes on Sunday morning.  Two more explosions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at a downmarket hotel and a house in a suburb of the capital, Colombo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ came in the early afternoon.  Most of the dead and wounded were Sri Lankans, although government officials said 38 foreigners were killed. That included British, US, Australian, Turkish, Indian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch and Portuguese nationals.  The UN ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fund said 45 children were among the dead.  Footage on CNN showed what it said was one of the bombers wearing a heavy backpack. The man patted a child on the head before entering the Gothic-style St. Sebastian church in Katuwapitiya, north of Colombo. Dozens were killed there.  The bombs brought a shattering end to a relative calm that had existed in the Buddhist-majority Indian Ocean island since a bitter civil war against mostly Hindu, ethnic Tamil separatists ended 10 years ago, and raised fears of a return to sectarian violence.  Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 22 million people include minority Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Until now, Christians had largely managed to avoid the worst of the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conflict and communal tensions.  The government imposed emergency rule at midnight on Monday, giving police extensive powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders.  An overnight curfew has also been imposed since Sunday.  FBI to help  US President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on Monday to pledge US support in bringing the perpetrators to justice.  The Washington Post quoted an unidentified law enforcement official as saying Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents were being sent to Sri Lanka to help with the investigation.  The FBI had offered expertise to test evidence and analysts were scouring databases for information, the Post said. Counter-terrorism officials from Britain were also due on Tuesday, a Western diplomat in Colombo said.  The attacks have also underlined concern over fractures in Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government, and whether the discord prevented action that might have stopped them.  The government received a tip-off from India this month about a possible attack on churches by the National Thawheed JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ut.  It was not immediately clear what action, if any, was taken in response. A government minister said on Monday that Wickremesinghe had not been informed about the warning and had been shut out of top security meetings because of a feud with President Maithripala Sirisena.  Sirisena fired Wickremesinghe last year only to be forced to reinstate him under pressure from the Supreme Court. Their relationship is reported to be fraught.  The U.S. State Department said in a travel advisory Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorist groupsÃ¢â‚¬Â were possibly plotting more attacks in Sri Lanka.  ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embassy warned its nationals against travelling to Sri Lanka in the near term because of Ã¢â‚¬Å“huge security risksÃ¢â‚¬Â.  China is a major investor in Sri Lanka.

A fourth attack against a hotel on Sunday failed, sources also told AFP, though it was not immediately clear if the bomber's explosives had failed or he had chosen not to detonate them.  He later blew himself up when police tracked him to a lodging in the capital.  Police have detained at least 40 people as they investigate the worst act of violence in the South Asian island nation since a civil war ended a decade ago.  But Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said police were hunting for more suspects at large, including some armed with explosives, and that further attacks were possible.  ""We are trying to apprehend them,"" he said.  The government has imposed a state of emergency, giving police and the military special powers, including the ability to arrest suspects without a court order.  'HARD TO BEAR'  The country observed a national day of mourning on Tuesday, beginning with a three-minute silence, as the bereaved began to bury their dead.  Flags were lowered to half-mast on government buildings, and liquor shops were ordered closed for the day.  More than 1,000 people gathered at St Sebastian's Church in Negombo, north of the capital, which was among those devastated in the blasts, to pay tribute to the dead.  An elderly man wept uncontrollably by the coffin bearing the body of his wife, while relatives of other victims stood aghast and silent.  Coffins were carried into the church grounds one by one for services, and then to a newly-established cemetery on church land.  ""It's very hard to bear,"" said Father Suranga Warnakulasuriya, who had come from another parish to help conduct funerals.  ""For me it is very difficult, so imagine how hard it is for the loved ones.""  The attacks were the worst ever against the country's small Christian minority, who make up just seven percent of the 21 million population.  Officials are investigating why more precautions were not taken after an Apr 11 warning from Sri Lanka's police that a ""foreign intelligence agency"" had reported the NTJ was planning suicide attacks on churches.  Government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said the warning was not passed on to Wickremesinghe or other top ministers.  President Maithripala Sirisena, who is also defence and law and order minister, said he will carry out a complete reorganisation of the security forces and the police in the wake of the attacks.  ""I hope to make major changes in the leadership of the security forces in the next 24 hours,"" Sirisena said in a nationwide address.  IDENTIFYING THE DEAD  Work was continuing to identify foreign victims in the blasts, with Washington reporting at least four Americans killed.  A Danish billionaire lost three of his children in the attacks, a spokesman for his company said.  Eight Britons, 10 Indians and nationals from Turkey, Australia, Japan and Portugal, were also reported killed.  The United Nations said at least 45 children, Sri Lankans and foreigners, were among those killed.  Of the three churches targeted, two are in the Colombo region and one is in the eastern city of Batticaloa.  Ethnic and religious violence has plagued Sri Lanka for decades, with a 37-year conflict with Tamil rebels followed by a more recent upswing in clashes between the Buddhist majority and Muslims.  The attacks have sparked local and international outrage, and have been condemned by Sri Lankan Muslim groups.",en,terrorattack,663,"['State', 'State']"

The claim, issued through the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AMAQ news agency, was made after Sri Lanka said two domestic Islamist groups with suspected links to foreign militants were suspected to have been behind the attacks at three churches and four hotels. About 500 people were also wounded in the bombings.  Three sources told Reuters that Sri Lankan intelligence officials had been warned hours earlier by India that attacks by Islamists were imminent. It was not clear what action, if any, was taken.  President Maithripala Sirisena said he would change the heads of the defence forces following their failure to act on the intelligence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will completely restructure the police and security forces in the coming weeks. I expect to change the heads of defence establishments within the next 24 hours,Ã¢â‚¬Â Sirisena said in an address to the nation.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The security officials who got the intelligence report from a foreign nation did not share it with me. I have decided to take stern action against these officials.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a news conference investigators were making progress in identifying the perpetrators.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will be following up on IS claims, we believe there may be some links,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  The government has said at least seven suicide bombers were involved.  In a statement, Islamic State named what it said were the seven attackers who carried out the attacks. It gave no further evidence to support its claim of responsibility.  The hardline militant group, who have lost the territory they once held in Syria and Iraq to Western-backed forces, later released a video on Amaq showing eight assailants, seven of whom were masked, pledging allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Reuters could not independently verify the claim and authorities did not officially identify the assailants.  Earlier, junior minister for defence Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament two Sri Lankan Islamist groups - the National Thawheed JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ut and Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim - were responsible for the blasts, which detonated during Easter services and as hotels served breakfast.  The first six bombs - on three churches and three luxury hotels - exploded within 20 minutes of each other. Two more explosions - at a downmarket hotel and a house in a suburb of the capital, Colombo - took place in the early afternoon.  Wickremesinghe said the militants had tried to attack another hotel but had failed.  Sri Lankan government and military sources said a Syrian had been detained among 40 people being questioned over the bombs.  Most of the dead and wounded were Sri Lankans, although government officials said 38 foreigners were killed. That included British, U.S., Australian, Turkish, Indian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch and Portuguese nationals.  The U.N. ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fund said 45 children were among the dead.  Footage on CNN showed what it said was one of the bombers wearing a heavy backpack. The man patted a child on the head before entering the Gothic-style St. Sebastian church in Katuwapitiya, north of Colombo. Dozens were killed there.  GRAPHIC: Sri Lanka bombings - tmsnrt.rs/2Xy02BA  Ã¢â‚¬ËœRETALIATIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  Wijewardene said investigators believed revenge for the March 15 killing of 50 people at two mosques during Friday prayers in the New Zealand city of Christchurch was the motive.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The initial investigation has revealed that this was in retaliation for the New Zealand mosque attack,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  He did not elaborate on why authorities believed there was a link to the New Zealand bloodshed, unleashed by a lone gunman.

CCTV/Siyatha News via REUTERS  The bombs brought a shattering end to a relative calm that had existed in Buddhist-majority country since a civil war against mostly Hindu, ethnic Tamil separatists ended 10 years ago, and raised fears of a return to sectarian violence.  Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 22 million people include minority Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Until now, Christians had largely managed to avoid the worst of the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conflict and communal tensions.  Pressure is likely to mount on the government over why effective action had not been taken in response to warnings from India about a possible attack on churches by the little-known National Thawheed JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ut group.  Indian intelligence officers contacted their Sri Lankan counterparts two hours before the first attack to warn of a specific threat on churches, one Sri Lankan defence source and an Indian government source said.  Another Sri Lankan defence source said a warning came Ã¢â‚¬Å“hours beforeÃ¢â‚¬Â the first strike.  Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presidency and the Indian foreign ministry both did not respond to requests for comment on the warnings.  A government minister had said on Monday that Wickremesinghe had not been informed about a warning and had been shut out of top security meetings because of a feud with President Maithripala Sirisena.  Wickremesinghe dismissed any suggestion that the rift with the president had hampered coordination on security, saying although they had had differences they had been thrashed out.  Sirisena fired Wickremesinghe last year only to be forced to reinstate him under pressure from the Supreme Court.  FEARS OVER FUNERALS  Tuesday was a day of mourning and more than 1,000 mourners gathered for a mass funeral at St. Sebastian church in the coastal city of Negombo, just north of the capital, Colombo, where more than 100 parishioners were killed on Sunday.  The ceremony began with prayers and singing under a tent put up in the courtyard of the church, which had most of its roof torn away by the blast.  Pall-bearers wearing white carried in wooden coffins one by one, followed by distraught relatives.  Slideshow (22 Images)  Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Sri Lanka who led the service, urged other churches to delay memorials amid fears that more bombers may be at large.  Security forces were on alert for more attack and the government imposed emergency rule giving police extensive powers to detain and interrogate suspects. An overnight curfew has also been in place since Sunday.  The government also said it had blocked online messaging services to stop the spread of inflammatory rumours that it feared could incite communal clashes.  The FBI is assisting Sri Lankan authorities with their investigation.

SundayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assault on a base in west-central Mali was the latest in a series of deadly raids by heavily armed jihadists, who have stepped up their attacks in central Mali and neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger in recent months.  The militants have tapped into festering tensions between semi-nomadic Fulani herders and farming communities across West AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s semi-arid Sahel region to try to win support among the Fulani, who often feel politically and socially marginalised.  Suspected militiamen from the Dogon ethnic group killed about 160 Fulani in the village of Ogossagou on March 23 in MaliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst ethnic bloodletting in living memory.  In a statement, JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), the leading Islamist group in Mali, said its attack was Ã¢â‚¬Å“in commitment to its past vow to avenge and exact retribution for the martyrs from the Ogossagou massacreÃ¢â‚¬Â, according to U.S.-based SITE, which monitors jihadist websites.  Previous Islamist attacks have led to reprisals by ethnic militia against Fulani civilians, feeding a cycle of violence that regional forces, U.N. peacekeepers and thousands of French troops deployed to the zone have proved unable to break.  JNIM said it had killed at least 16 soldiers and taken two hostage, while four of its own fighters died in combat. MaliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Defence Ministry said on Saturday that 11 soldiers had been killed.  Mali President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita appointed a new prime minister on Monday, days after the government resigned following pressure to respond to the Ogossagou massacre and other violence.

The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility and released images that purported to show the seven bombers who blew themselves up at three churches and three hotels Sunday in the worst violence this South Asian island nation has seen since its civil war ended a decade ago.  The government has said the attacks were carried out by Islamic fundamentalists in apparent retaliation for the New Zealand mosque massacre last month but has said the seven bombers were all Sri Lankan. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said investigators were still working to determine the extent of the bombers' foreign links.  Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said Wednesday morning that 18 suspects were arrested overnight, raising the total detained to 58. The prime minister had warned on Tuesday that several suspects armed with explosives were still at large.  The Islamic State group has lost all the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria and has made a series of unsupported claims of responsibility around the world.  Sri Lankan authorities have blamed a local extremist group, National Towheed Jamaar, whose leader, alternately known as Mohammed Zahran or Zahran Hashmi, became known to Muslim leaders three years ago for his incendiary speeches online.  The IS group's Aamaq news agency released an image purported to show the leader of the attackers, standing amid seven others whose faces are covered. The group did not provide any other evidence for its claim, and the identities of those depicted in the image were not independently verified.  Meanwhile, in an address to Parliament, Ruwan Wijewardene, the state minister of defense, said ""weakness"" within Sri Lanka's security apparatus led to the failure to prevent the nine bombings.  ""By now it has been established that the intelligence units were aware of this attack and a group of responsible people were informed about the impending attack,"" Wijewardene said. ""However, this information has been circulated among only a few officials.""  In a live address to the nation late Tuesday, Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena said he also was kept in the dark on the intelligence about the planned attacks and vowed to ""take stern action"" against the officials who failed to share the information. He also pledged ""a complete restructuring"" of the security forces.  Wijewardene said the government had evidence that the bombings were carried out ""by an Islamic fundamentalist group"" in retaliation for the March 15 mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 50 people, although he did not disclose what the evidence was.  The office of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern issued a statement responding to the Christchurch claim that described Sri Lanka's investigation as ""in its early stages.""  ""New Zealand has not yet seen any intelligence upon which such an assessment might be based,"" it said. An Australian white supremacist, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, was arrested in the Christchurch shootings.  Word from international intelligence agencies that National Towheed Jamaar was planning attacks apparently didn't reach the prime minister's office until after the massacre, exposing continuing turmoil in Sri Lanka's government.  A block on most social media since the attacks has left a vacuum of information, fueling confusion and giving little reassurance the danger had passed.  Wickremesinghe said he feared the massacre could unleash instability and he vowed to ""vest all necessary powers with the defense forces"" to act against those responsible.  The history of Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka, a country of 21 million including large Hindu, Muslim and Christian minorities, is rife with ethnic and sectarian conflict.  In the nation's 26-year civil war, the Tamil Tigers, a powerful rebel army known for using suicide bombers, had little history of targeting Christians and was crushed by the government in 2009. Anti-Muslim bigotry fed by Buddhist nationalists has swept the country recently.  In March 2018, Buddhist mobs ransacked businesses and set houses on fire in Muslim neighborhoods around Kandy, a city in central Sri Lanka that is popular with tourists.  After the mob attacks, Sri Lanka's government also blocked some social media sites, hoping to slow the spread of false information or threats that could incite more violence.  Sri Lanka has no history of Islamic militancy. Its small Christian community has seen only scattered incidents of harassment.",en,terrorattack,,
2808829,bbci,None,UN: More civilians killed by Afghan forces than Taliban,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48047356,,25/4/2019 10:07,"Image copyright Getty Images  For the first time, more civilians have been killed by Afghan forces this year than by insurgent groups, the UN says.  In a report, the international body said pro-government forces were responsible for 54% of civilian deaths during the first three months of 2019.  Tadamichi Yamamoto, the UN's special representative for Afghanistan, called the latest figures ""shocking"".  The findings come as civilian casualties fell to their lowest level for the period since 2013.  Both the US and the Taliban have held peace talks since October last year, but fighting has continued as both sides look for leverage in negotiations.  The UN, which has been monitoring the conflict since 2009, says between January and March insurgent groups killed 227 civilians and injured 736 others.  In contrast, Afghan and international forces caused 305 deaths and 303 injuries - a 39% jump from the same period last year.  The leading causes of casualties, according to the UN, were ground fighting and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  Air strikes also killed 145 civilians during the period, half of them women and children. The UN attributed almost all of these to American forces.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Afghan security forces are being trained by some of the 14,000 US troops remaining in the country.  The US military holds itself ""to the highest standards of accuracy and accountability,"" Colonel Dave Butler, spokesman for US Forces-Afghanistan, told the AFP news agency.  Mr Yamamoto said ""all parties must do more to safeguard civilians"".  ""The best way to end the suffering of non-combatants is to end the fighting through an agreed-upon reduction in violence on all sides,"" said Col Butler.  Overall, the UN reported a 23% drop in casualties compared with the same period in 2018. The agency said it was ""unclear"" whether this was influenced by the peace talks or ""any measures taken by parties to the conflict to better protect civilians"".  US forces have been stationed in the country since it led a military coalition to overthrow the Taliban in 2001.  Around 14,000 American troops are helping to train Afghan security forces.

Two bank officials told Reuters the street outside the building near the World Trade Center in the capital, Colombo, was blocked to traffic before the security alert was lifted.  Underscoring the nervous atmosphere in the Indian Ocean nation, authorities also shut the entry road to ColomboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main airport after a suspicious vehicle was identified at a nearby carpark. The road was reopened when the alert was declared a false alarm.  A police spokesman also said there was a so-far unexplained explosion in a town east of the capital but there were no casualties. It was not a controlled detonation like other blasts in recent days and was being investigated, he said.  More people, including foreigners, were swept up for questioning overnight as domestic and international authorities probed deeper into the bombings, which were potentially the deadliest operation claimed by Islamic State.  About 500 people were also wounded in the attacks on three churches and four hotels.  Police said an Egyptian and several Pakistanis were among those detained overnight, although there was no immediate suggestion they had direct links to the attacks.  Home-grown bombers  A picture has slowly emerged of a group of nine well-educated, home-grown Islamist suicide bombers, including a woman, who carried out the attacks in the South Asian nation.  However, authorities have also focused their investigations on international links to domestic Islamist groups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ National Thawheed JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ut and Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they believed carried out the attacks.  Islamic State offered no firm information to back up its claim of responsibility.  The Islamist group released a video on Tuesday that showed eight men, all but one with their faces covered, standing under a black Islamic State flag and declaring their loyalty to its leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.  The man whose face could be seen has been identified as Mohamed Zahran, a preacher from the east of Sri Lanka known for his militant views who officials believe was the attackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mastermind.  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday another of the bombers had lived in Australia with his wife and child on a student visa but left in 2013.  Morrison did not identify the man, although his family have said his name was Abdul Latheef Mohamed Jameel.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can confirm that the suicide bomber had been in Australia,Ã¢â‚¬Â Morrison told reporters.  Police said on Thursday 16 more people were detained for questioning overnight, taking the number held since Sunday to at least 76. That number includes a Syrian national.  A police statement said one of those detained overnight was linked to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorist organisationÃ¢â‚¬Â but gave no other details.  It said another was taken into custody after they investigated posts on the individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Facebook page and found what they described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“hate speechÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was related to the spreading and preaching of terrorism,Ã¢â‚¬Â a police spokesman said.  Others have also been caught up in the broader crackdown.  Police said they detained an Egyptian who was found not to have a valid visa or passport. The man taught Arabic in a school about 70km from Colombo and had been living in Sri Lanka for more than seven years.  A police spokesman also said a group of Pakistanis had been detained among an unspecified number of foreign nationals for overstaying their visas.  Pakistanis flee  The bombings shattered the relative calm that has existed in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka since a civil war against mostly Hindu, ethnic Tamil separatists ended 10 years ago, and raised fears of a return to sectarian violence.  Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 22 million people include minority Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Until now, Christians had largely managed to avoid the worst of the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conflict and communal tensions.  President Maithripala Sirisena will meet representatives of different faiths later on Thursday to address concerns of a sectarian backlash.  Muslims have fled the Negombo region on Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s west coast since scores of worshippers were killed in the bombing of the St. Sebastian church there on Sunday. Communal tensions have since flared.  Hundreds of Pakistani Muslims left the port city on Wednesday, crammed into buses, after threats of revenge.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Because of the bomb blasts and explosions that have taken place here, the local Sri Lankan people have attacked our houses,Ã¢â‚¬Â Adnan Ali, a Pakistani Muslim, told Reuters as he prepared to board a bus.  Sri Lankan officials have said they believed the bombings were carried out in retaliation for the March 15 attacks by a lone gunman on two mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said she has seen no evidence to support that claim.  Most of the Easter Sunday victims were Sri Lankans, although authorities confirmed at least 38 foreigners were also killed. These included British, U.S., Australian, Turkish, Indian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch and Portuguese nationals.    ",en,terrorattack,,

The investigation, published by Amnesty International and the monitoring group Airwars on Thursday, urged top coalition members to ""end almost two years of denial about the massive civilian death toll and destruction it unleashed in Raqqa"".  Donatella Rovera, senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty, said, ""Many of the air bombardments were inaccurate and tens of thousands of artillery strikes were indiscriminate.""  181127151642097  ""Coalition forces razed Raqqa, but they cannot erase the truth,"" she said.  The findings were compiled after months of field research and extensive data analysis, including via a project that saw 3,000 digital activists scan satellite imagery online.  Amnesty and Airwars said the cases they had documented probably amounted to violations of international humanitarian law.  They also urged coalition members, especially the United States, Britain and France, to put in place an independent investigation mechanism and create a fund to compensate victims and their families.  Responding to the report, the coalition said it takes ""all reasonable measures to minimise civilian casualties"" and that there were still open allegations it was investigating.  ""Any unintentional loss of life during the defeat of Daesh is tragic,"" said Scott Rawlinson, a coalition spokesman in an emailed statement later on Thursday, using an Arabic acronym for ISIL  ""However, it must be balanced against the risk of enabling Daesh to continue terrorist activities, causing pain and suffering to anyone they choose,"" he added.  190404122152387  ISIL seized Raqqa in early 2014 during its advance through Syria and Iraq in which it built a self-proclaimed caliphate characterised by summary executions.  Its mass killing and enslavement of minorities were described as genocide by the United Nations.  The group has since been driven from all the territory it controlled by military campaigns waged by an array of forces including the Syrian and Iraqi governments, US, its European allies and their rivals Russia and Iran.  ISIL was defeated by US-backed fighters in its last Syrian stronghold this year. Despite no longer controlling territory, it is still seen as a threat capable of launching attacks around the world.  Amnesty said last year that there was evidence coalition air and artillery strikes in Raqqa had broken international law by endangering the lives of civilians, but until now had not given an estimate of the death toll during the battle.  The London-based rights group also criticised the extensive use of artillery in the battle of Raqqa.

ARSA has been blamed for deadly attacks on Myanmar security forces in recent years, including the attacks which sparked the 2017 clampdown.  Bangladesh police said the creation of seven new police posts, the deployment of armed police and better intelligence had improved security.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The report is exaggerated but not baseless. It is true violence in the camps has increased,Ã¢â‚¬Â CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bazar district police spokesman Iqbal Hossain told AFP.  About 60 Rohingya have been killed in the camps since the 2017 refugee influx, Hossain said.  He denied that ARSA had a presence in the camps and said most killings were part of a power struggle among Rohingya groups.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Intelligence activities have been stepped up to find out whether ARSA is involved in killings,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, adding that some 1,000 police and security officers had been deployed in camps.  But ICG said police were Ã¢â‚¬Å“overstretchedÃ¢â‚¬Â and focused on perimeter security and the protection of local Bangladeshis.  When the night comes and Ã¢â‚¬Å“humanitarian workers withdraw to their bases in CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bazar town, security is in the hands of untrained and unarmed night watchmen appointed from among the refugees,Ã¢â‚¬Â it said.

The quarantines affects Los Angeles (UCLA) and California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) and comes as the United States battles the highest number of measles cases since the country declared the virus eliminated in 2000.  The people ordered quarantined at two California campuses were exposed to measles and could not provide evidence they had been immunised against the disease, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement.  The United States has confirmed 695 cases of measles, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday, with many of those cases in the states of New York and Washington.  California health officials have said the state has confirmed 38 measles cases, pointing to a new challenge in their work to contain the disease which includes the quarantines at Cal State LA and UCLA.  ""Both universities are assisting with the implementation of quarantine orders and determining how best to support students who must be quarantined and who live on campus,"" the Department of Public Health said in a statement.  The quarantine at Cal State LA is related to a measles exposure believed to have occurred in a library on April 11, the university said in a statement.  Related Story Millions of children miss measles shots, creating outbreaks: Unicef  Related Story Widening anti-vaccine movement worldwide paves the way for a measles comeback  Related Story Global measles cases up 300 per cent year-on-year  The quarantine affects 198 Cal State LA employees who were at the library, including 71 employees who are also students, the university statement said.  At UCLA, 119 students and eight staff members who were exposed to measles at the campus earlier this month and could not provide proof of immunity were ordered quarantined on Wednesday, the university said in a statement.  Since then, officials have released 45 people from the UCLA quarantine after establishing they had immunity to measles.  US public health officials have blamed the nationwide outbreak, which coincides with a global rise in the prevalence of the disease, in part on the spread of misinformation about the safety of vaccines.  Although the disease was eliminated from the country in 2000, meaning the virus was no longer continually present year-round, outbreaks still happen via travelers coming from countries where measles is still common, the CDC says.  The virus can lead to deadly complications, but no measles deaths have been reported in the latest outbreaks.",en,diseas,,

Mr Trump has previously appeared to link vaccines and autism. Public health experts say there is no link.  Vaccination rates have dropped steadily in the US with many parents objecting for philosophical or religious reasons. Others, known as ""anti-vaxxers"", believe discredited information that vaccines cause autism in children.  The CDC says measles cases have reached a level not seen since 2000, when the disease was eliminated from the US.

""What intelligence agencies have told me is that Zaharan Hashim was killed during the Shangri-La attack,"" President Maithripala Sirisena told reporters, referring to the leader of a local extremist group.  He added that Hashim led the attack at the high-end hotel and was accompanied by a second bomber, identified only as Ilham.  He said the information came from military intelligence and was based in part on CCTV footage recovered from the scene. Hashim appeared in a video released by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group after they claimed the bombings, but his whereabouts after the blasts were not immediately clear.  Hashim's zealotry fuelled fears in the east coast town of Kattankudy long before he became Sri Lanka's most wanted man. Heavy security surrounds the main mosque in Muslim-majority Kattankudy, where religious leaders say they sounded the alarm about Hashim years ago, beginning with his expulsion from a seminary during his teens.  ""It was the first time a student had been expelled for being a hardliner,"" said Mr Mohammed Buhary Mohammed Fahim, a senior official at the Jamiathul Falah seminary and who was a younger contemporary of Hashim's at the school.  ""When he arrived here at the age of 12, he was clearly very intelligent, very studious and asked lots of questions. He was popular and sociable,"" added Mr Fahim.

When Hashim sought to influence his fellow students, parents complained to the seminary chiefs and the school asked him to leave.  After a few years away, he returned to Kattankudy, founded the National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ) group and worked with some former classmates to build a mosque where he could preach and share his rabble-rousing sermons.  ""He was a good orator. He would pick and choose words from the Quran and twist and misuse them,"" said one official at a local mosque on condition of anonymity.  Hashim's violent streak attracted police attention three years ago, when he brandished a sword during clashes with members of another Muslim organisation, said the official. But just as the net seemed to be closing in, Hashim went into hiding with some followers, operating what appeared to be an NTJ breakaway group.  According to Mr Hilmy Ahamed, vice-president of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, Hashim shifted base to southern Indiabut but would travel back and forth.  The mosque official who did not wish to be named said: ""When the attacks happened, even we couldn't imagine that he would do something like this. The police made a big mistake.

He was a nobody, with no claim to scholarship other than ambition.  Zahran and his four brothers and sisters squeezed into a two-room house with their parents in a small seaside town in eastern Sri Lanka; their father was a poor man who sold packets of food on the street and had a reputation for being a petty thief.  ""His father didn't do much,"" recalled the school's vice-principal, SM Aliyar, laughing out loud.  The boy surprised the school with his sharp mind. For three years, Zahran practiced memorising the Quran. Next came his studies in Islamic law. But the more he learned, the more Zahran argued that his teachers were too liberal in their reading of the holy book.  ""He was against our teaching and the way we interpreted the Quran - he wanted his radical Islam,"" said Aliyar. ""So we kicked him out.""  Aliyar, now 73 with a long white beard, remembers the day Zahran left in 2005. ""His father came and asked, 'Where can he go?'.""  The school would hear again of Zahran Hashim. And the world now knows his name. Sri Lankan officials have identified him as the suspected ringleader of a group that carried out a series of Easter Sunday suicide bombings in the country on April 21.  The blasts killed more than 250 people in churches and luxury hotels, one of the deadliest-ever such attacks in South Asia. There were nine suicide bombers who blew apart men, women and children as they sat to pray or ate breakfast.  Most of the attackers were well-educated and from wealthy families, with some having been abroad to study, according to Sri Lankan officials.  That description does not, however, fit their alleged leader, a man said to be in his early 30s, who authorities say died in the slaughter. Zahran was different.  INTELLIGENCE FAILINGS  Sri Lanka's national leadership has come under heavy criticism for failing to heed warnings from Indian intelligence services - at least three in April alone - that an attack was pending. But Zahran's path from provincial troublemaker to alleged militant mastermind was marked by years of missed or ignored signals that the man with a thick beard and paunch was dangerous.  His increasingly militant brand of Islam was allowed to grow inside a marginalised minority community - barely 10 per cent of the country's roughly 20 million people are Muslim - against a backdrop of a dysfunctional developing nation.  The top official at the nation's defence ministry resigned on Thursday, saying that some institutions under his charge had failed.  For much of his adult life, Zahran courted controversy inside the Muslim community itself.  In the Internet age, that problem did not stay local. Zahran released online videos calling for jihad and threatening bloodshed.  After the blasts, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed credit and posted a video of Zahran, clutching an assault rifle, standing before the group's black flag and pledging allegiance to its leader.  Related Story Shoot-out in Sri Lanka at house used to make suicide vests  Related Story Sri Lanka says radical leader killed in Easter hotel attack  Related Story Suspected Sri Lanka attacks ringleader preached slaughter, never hid hatred  Related Story Sri Lanka troops join hunt for suspects; govt admits to 'major' intelligence lapses  The precise relationship between Zahran and ISIS is not yet known. An official with India's security services, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that during a raid on a suspected ISIS cell by the National Investigation Agency earlier this year officers found copies of Zahran's videos. The operation was in the state of Tamil Nadu, just across a thin strait of ocean from Sri Lanka.  'LIKE A SPOILED CHILD'  Back in 2005, Zahran was looking to make his way in the world. His hometown of Kattankudy is some seven hours' drive from Colombo on the other side of the island nation, past the countless palm trees, roadside Buddha statues, cashew hawkers and an occasional lumbering elephant in the bush. It is a town of about 40,000 people, a dot on the eastern coast with no clear future for an impoverished young man who'd just been expelled.  Zahran joined a mosque in 2006, the Dharul Athar, and gained a place on its management committee. But within three years they'd had a falling out.  ""He wanted to speak more independently, without taking advice from elders,"" said the mosque's imam, or spiritual leader, MTM Fawaz.  Also, the young man was more conservative, Fawaz said, objecting, for instance, to women wearing bangles or earrings.  ""The rest of us come together as community leaders, but Zahran wanted to speak for himself,"" said Fawaz, a man with broad shoulders lounging with a group of friends in a back office of the mosque after evening prayers. ""He was a black sheep who broke free.""  Mohamed Yusuf Mohamed Thaufeek, a friend who met Zahran at school and later became an adherent of his, said the problems revolved around Zahran's habit of misquoting Islamic scriptures.  The mosque's committee banned him from preaching for three months in 2009. Zahran stormed off.  ""We treated him like a spoiled child, a very narrow-minded person who was always causing some trouble,"" said the head of the committee, Mohamed Ismail Mohamed Naushad, a timber supplier who shook his head at the memory.  Now on his own, Zahran began to collect a group of followers who met in what Fawaz described as ""a hut"".  At about that time, Zahran, then 23, married a young girl from a small town outside the capital of Colombo and brought his bride back to Kattankudy, according to his sister, Mathaniya.  ""I didn't have much of a connection with her - she was 14,""she said.  Despite being ""a bit rough-edged"", Zahran was a skilled speaker and others his age were drawn to his speeches and Quranic lessons, said Thaufeek. He travelled the countryside at times, giving his version of religious instruction as he went.  Also, Zahran had found a popular target: the town's Sufi population, who practice a form of Islam often described a mystical, but which to conservatives is heresy.  Tensions in the area went back some years. In 2004, there was a grenade attack on a Sufi mosque and in 2006 several homes of Sufis were set afire. Announcements boomed from surrounding mosques at the time calling for a Sufi spiritual leader to be killed, said Sahlan Khalil Rahman, secretary of a trust that oversees a group of Sufi mosques.  He blamed followers of the fundamentalist Wahhabi strain of Islam that some locals say became more popular after funding from Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Wahhabism, flowed to mosques in Kattankudy.  It was, Rahman said, an effort ""to convert Sufis into Wahhabis through this terrorism"". Rahman handed over a photograph album showing charred homes, bullet holes sprayed across an office wall and a shrine's casket upended.  ONLINE RADICAL  It was an ideal backdrop for Zahran's bellicose delivery and apparent sense of religious destiny.  He began holding rallies, bellowing insults through loudspeakers that reverberated inside the Sufis' house of worship as they tried to pray.  In 2012, Zahran started a mosque of his own. The Sufis were alarmed and, Rahman said, passed on complaints to both local law enforcement and eventually national government offices. No action was taken.  The then-officer in charge of Kattankudy police, Ariyabandhu Wedagedara, said in a telephone interview that he couldn't arrest people simply because of theological differences.  ""The problem at the time was between followers of different Islamic sects - Zahran was not a major troublemaker, but he and followers of other sects, including the Sufis, were at loggerheads,"" Wedagedara said.  Zahran found another megaphone: the Internet. His Facebook page was taken down after the bombings, but Muslims in the area said his video clips had previously achieved notoriety.  His speeches went from denouncing Sufis to ""kafirs"", or non-believers, in general. Zahran's sister, Mathaniya, said in an interview that she thought ""his ideas became more radical from listening to Islamic State views on the Internet"".  In one undated video, Zahran, in a white tunic and standing in front of an image of flames, boomed in a loud voice: ""You will not have time to pick up the remains of blown-up bodies. We'll keep sending those insulting Allah to hell.""  'HARD TO TAKE'  Zahran spoke in Tamil, making his words available to young Muslims clicking on their cellphones in Kattankudy and other towns like it during a period when, in both 2014 and 2018, reports and images spread of Sinhalese Buddhists rioting against Muslims in Sri Lanka.  In 2017, Zahran's confrontations boiled over. At a rally near a Sufi community, his followers came wielding swords. At least one man was hacked and hospitalised. The police arrested several people connected to Zahran, including his father and one of his brothers. Zahran slipped away from public view.  That December, the mosque Zahran founded released a public notice disowning him. Thaufeek, his friend from school, is now the head. He counted the places that Zahran had been driven away from - his school, the Dharul Athar mosque and then, ""we ourselves kicked him out, which would have been hard for him to take"".  The next year, a group of Buddha statues was vandalised in the town of Mawanella, about five hours drive from Kattankudy.  There, in the lush mountains of Sri Lanka's interior, Zahran had taken up temporary residence.  ""He was preaching to kill people,"" said AGM Anees, who has served as an imam at a small mosque in the area for a decade. ""This is not Islam, this is violence.""  Zahran went into hiding once more.  On the Thursday morning before the Easter Sunday bombings, Zahran's sister-in-law knocked on the door of a neighbour who did seamstress work near Kattankudy. She handed over a parcel of fabric and asked for it to be sewn into a tunic by the end of the day.  ""She said she was going on a family trip,"" said the neighbour, MH Sithi Nazlya.  Zahran's sister says that her parents turned off their cellphones on the Friday. On Sunday, when she visited their home, they were gone.  She does not know if Zahran arranged for them to be taken somewhere safe. Or why he would have carried out the bombing.  But now in Kattankudy, and in many other places, people are talking about Mohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran.",en,terrorattack,662,"['South', 'South', 'South', 'Top', 'Top', 'Top']"

The Libyan National Army (LNA) force of Haftar, which is allied to a parallel government, has repeatedly flown air strikes since starting an offensive three weeks ago to take the capital held by the internationally recognised government.  The offensive has exacerbated chaos in Libya since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, threatens to disrupt oil supplies, boost migration across the Mediterranean to Europe and scupper U.N. plans for an election to end rivalries between rival administrations in east and west.  The Tripoli forces have pushed back the LNA on the ground in some southern suburbs in recent days. A suspected drone could be heard for almost one hour and half followed by at least eight loud explosions, witnesses said. Anti-aircraft fire could be heard.  Reuters was unable to establish with certainty whether an aircraft or drone was behind the strikes though residents reported a humming sound similar to unmanned aircraft.  Supporters of the Tripoli government had blamed a UAE drone for previous air strikes. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt have helped Haftar, a former Gaddafi general, in the past with air strikes when he was gradually taking control of the east.  Both countries have in past years provided the LNA with military equipment such as helicopters, even building an air base, previous U.N. reports have said, helping Haftar turn into a major player in Libya.  OIL  The air strikes came before the LNA had sent a warship to the eastern Ras Lanuf oil port, after days of unconfirmed rumours of a foreign navy ship having been sighted.  LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told reporters his forces had sent the Alkarama patrol vessel to Ras Lanuf in Libya's key Oil Crescent region as part of a ""training mission"" to visit the operations room and to secure oil facilities.  The LNA last year had received the patrol vessel, which was previously owned by a firm with a postal address in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to U.N. report monitoring violations of an arms embargo on Libya.  A port engineer said the navy ship's berthing had not affected oil exports which were going normally. It was not immediately clear whether the ship had left.  State oil firm NOC said several Libyan warships had used the oil port, while military personnel had also entered the nearby Es Sider terminal, located in the east of the OPEC producer in trouble since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.  It did not say who was responsible for this but the two terminals, Libya's biggest oil export ports, are controlled by the LNA.  The LNA controls eastern oil ports and the county's oilfields but had technically left state firm NOC to run them as foreign buyers of oil only want to deal with NOC, which they have known for decades.  NOC is based in Tripoli and has sought to stay out of the conflict between the two governments, handling the oil and gas exports, Libya's lifeline.  The export proceeds are given by NOC to the Tripoli central bank which mainly works with the Tripoli government but also pays some public servants in LNA-controlled eastern Libya.  Haftar is allied to a parallel administration which has set up its own state oil firm and repeatedly sought to take over oil exports from NOC Tripoli.  NOC condemned in a statement the use of its facilities for military purposes without mentioning the LNA or naming who was behind the acts.  ""Incidents recorded by NOC include: The seizure of the Es Sider airstrip for military use, military personnel entering the port of Es Sider as well as attempts to requisition NOC tug boats, the berthing of warships in the Ras Lanuf terminal and its use by Libyan military vessels.""  ""NOC strongly condemns the militarization of Libyan national energy infrastructure,"" it added.  The NOC also said revenues rose to more than $1.5 billion in March, up 20 percent from the previous month, but that fighting posed a serious threat to production.  ""The latest outbreak of hostilities ... poses a serious threat to our operations, production and the national economy,"" said NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla.  Separately, the Tripoli-based interior ministry said it had seized an Iranian ship ""carrying a mysterious shipment"" in Misrata, a western city allied to Tripoli forces.

Up to 10 per cent of the 695 confirmed measles cases in the current outbreak occurred in people who received one or two doses of the vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Advertisement  The figure illustrates what can happen when a large number of individuals, even those who have been vaccinated, are exposed to the measles. CDC recommends that people who are living in or traveling to outbreak areas should check their vaccination status and consider getting a new dose.  Dr Allison Bartlett, an infectious disease expert at the University of Chicago Medicine, said the Ã¢â‚¬Å“continued vulnerability to infectionÃ¢â‚¬Â is why high-risk adults such as healthcare workers are routinely advised to get a second dose of the measles vaccine if they have not had one.  But knowing your vaccination status can be tricky, experts said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complicated and often futile because it's very difficult to resurrect those old records,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  Advertisement  Advertisement  People vaccinated in the United States since 1989 would most likely have received two doses of the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot under federal guidelines, and that is still considered the standard for protection.  An illustration provides a 3D graphical representation of a spherical-shaped, measles virus particle studded with glycoprotein tubercles in this handout image obtained by Reuters, Apr 9, 2019. (Image: Reuters/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)  Anyone vaccinated between 1963 and 1989 would likely have received only one dose, with many people immunized in the earlier years receiving an inactivated version of the virus. Americans born before 1957 are considered immune as they would have been exposed to the virus directly in an outbreak.  Merck & Co Inc is the sole US provider of the MMR vaccine. The company said in a statement that it has Ã¢â‚¬Å“taken steps to increase US supplyÃ¢â‚¬Â of the vaccine due to the current outbreak.  HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS  The measles virus is highly contagious and can cause blindness, deafness, brain damage or death. It is currently spreading in outbreaks in many parts of the world.  According to the World Health Organization, 95 per cent of a population needs to be vaccinated to provide Ã¢â‚¬Å“herd immunity,Ã¢â‚¬Â a form of indirect protection that prevents infection in people too young or sick to be vaccinated.  US public health officials have blamed the current outbreak in part on rising rates of vaccine skepticism that have reduced measles immunity in certain communities.  For travelers to outbreak areas abroad, the CDC recommends adults consider getting another dose of MMR unless they have proof of receiving two prior doses, take a blood test showing immunity, or were born before 1957.  In general, the CDC says two doses of the measles vaccine should provide 97 per cent protection; one dose should offer 93 per cent protection. However, immunity can wane over time.  This has occurred even in adults with two documented doses of the vaccine, said Dr. Michael Phillips, chief epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health, which serves parts of New York City, a hot spot in the US outbreak.  He said in kids, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the vaccine is really effective,Ã¢â‚¬Â but in some adults, memory T-cells, which recognize and attack germs, do not fight the virus as effectively as they once did.  Rapid blood tests are available that can detect whether a person is immune based on the level of measles antibodies, but the tests are not 100 per cent reliable.  Adults who have any doubt about their immunity should get another dose, Schaffner said: ""It's safe. There's no downside risk. Just roll up your sleeve.Ã¢â‚¬Â",en,diseas,,

Then the blasts began.  The coordinated suicide bombings by Islamist militants at hotels and churches killed more than 250 people and sent shockwaves through an Indian Ocean island state that had enjoyed relative peace since a civil war ended a decade ago.  How such a sophisticated operation could have been carried out in a country where violence by Islamist militants drawn from the Muslim minority was not high on the list of concerns has left Sri Lankans and foreign intelligence agencies stumped.  President Maithripala Sirisena has announced a total overhaul of the security establishment, blaming them for failing to communicate several warnings they had about potential attacks, including one from India hours before the first bomb.  However, interviews with more than a dozen people with direct knowledge of the Sri Lankan government and security apparatus, including military sources, senior diplomats and intelligence agents, suggest deeper failings that created an ideal environment for extremists looking for a soft target.  Since Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka won a 26-year conflict against mostly Hindu ethnic Tamil separatists, a well-resourced military has failed to adapt to shifting security threats, the sources said.  ""The government was asleep. The military was asleep. They've been asleep for a long time,"" said Costa, perching on his rickshaw as a suspicious policeman peered inside.  Costa's analysis is a simplification, but some experts agree that a lack of preparedness was a significant factor that led to a little-known Islamist group being able to orchestrate the deadliest attack of its kind in South Asia's history.  Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have both apologised for any lapses that might have contributed to the attacks. Wickremesinghe said the government and security forces take ""collective responsibility"".  LONG-TERM DECLINE  There are no official figures on the size of Sri Lanka's armed forces but experts estimate there are around 150,000 active military personnel and 80,000 police officers, both substantial forces for a country of just 22 million.  Despite its size, the military had become ""flabby"" and ""unfocused"", according to one Western diplomat. Military personnel with little to do have been conscripted into commercial ventures, including whale-watching tours for tourists, running hair salons and tending to farms.  Military spokesman Sumith Atapattu said it was wrong to suggest that the armed forces had not given sufficient priority to evidence of emerging Islamist extremism, but added they could only take action when there was evidence of criminal activity.  ""We have passed the necessary information to the relevant authorities. But what is the legal background the military has to control extremism? A person being radicalized is not an offence in our country,"" he said.  ""We are searching for reconciliation after a long period of war and we cannot use a sledgehammer to kill a fly.""  Another foreign diplomat said he spoke to a senior military intelligence official the day before the attacks to warn him of an imminent threat. When he asked the official if he would raise the warning to the top echelons of government, he was told ""not during the holidays"".  ""Ten years of peace breeds over-confidence,"" the diplomat said. ""It's easy to focus on the last weeks and months, but this attack was made possible by a much longer-term decline in the functionality of Sri Lanka's security services and government.""  The military has also been more focussed on monitoring the country's Tamil population and preventing another separatist insurgency than on a Muslim community that makes up only 10 percent of the population, defence sources and experts said.  ""This inattention could have created the opportunity for a local group Ã¢â‚¬â€ perhaps with external encouragement or support Ã¢â‚¬â€ to emerge from obscurity and perpetrate such terrifically lethal attacks,"" said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.  Security experts believe National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NJT), a local Islamist group that has emerged over the last year, was responsible for the attacks, likely with the assistance of outside groups. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the bombings, without providing evidence.  Though Sri Lanka has no significant history of violence between its Muslim and Christian minorities, some say the warning signs of a changing social dynamic were there.  Concerns raised about a more radical strain of Islam emerging over the last five years went unheeded, civil society groups and Western diplomats say.  Hashim Mohamed Zahran, the alleged ringleader of the Easter Sunday blasts, had been flagged to security officials as a threat.  ""We had concerns and we raised them. They were not properly considered,"" said Hilmy Ahamed, vice president of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, a civil society group.  ""TRAGIC COMPLACENCY""  Zahran, a man in his early 30s who had been preaching an increasingly militant brand of Islam, was one of two attackers who died after detonating their explosives in the luxury Shangri-La hotel, intelligence officials say.  Ahamed said that in February he warned a contact in the intelligence services of the threat posed by Zahran. He received a text message response. ""Thank you. Noted,"" it said.  ""There was an overall environment of complacency. That is the tragedy,"" Ahamed said.  The top civil servant in Sri Lanka's defence ministry, Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, resigned on Thursday, taking responsibility for the attacks after Sirisena pinned the blame on the security services.  Many Sri Lankans believe a deep rift between Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has also undermined national security.  Sirisena fired Wickremesinghe last year, after months of tension, only to be forced to reinstate him under pressure from the Supreme Court.  Since then their relationship has deteriorated further to the point where their factions actively try to undermine each other, including not sharing security information, defence sources say.  ""Inefficiency, mediocrity, and infighting within the government contributed to last week's attack,"" said Iqbal Athas, a defence analyst, adding that vital intelligence-gathering resources had been diverted in recent years to spy on political rivals rather than to monitor extremists.  Presidential aide Shiral Lakthilaka said Sirisena and Wickremesinghe's feuding had come to an end.  ""The past is past,"" Lakthilaka said in response to a question about the impact the rift had on security. ""Whatever the setbacks, both have shed their differences and are working towards eradicating this menace and bring all the underground activities to a standstill.""  An ally of the prime minister, government spokesman and health minister Rathija Senaratne, blamed the president for the rift. ""He by-passed ministers as well,"" he said.  If there was an element of lethargy in the Sri Lankan state, it has been jolted back to life. One diplomat said the defence forces had ""reverted to war mode"".  The streets of Colombo are marshalled by hundreds of soldiers and police, as everyone fears the possibility of more attacks or a spike in retaliatory sectarian violence. Nearly 10,000 soldiers have been deployed countrywide.  A gun battle on Friday between troops and suspected militants on the east coast killed 15, including Zahran's father and two brothers, in a sign that Sri Lanka's security crisis is far from over.  Named Lonely Planet's No. 1 travel destination for 2019, Sri Lanka had built a reputation over the past decade as a stable, relaxed island in a chaotic region.  That image has been shattered by Sunday's bombs.  ""For 10 years this was a laid-back place,"" said Costa, as a truck of armed soldiers sped past. ""Not anymore.""

Dressed in their finest clothes for one of the most important church services of the year, this was the first generation in decades to grow up free of violence. Their stories - and the struggle for the surviving children to comprehend the carnage - take the island down a devastatingly familiar path.  When bubbly Sneha Savindri Fernando went along for the Easter Sunday Mass at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, her mind was on something else entirely. She had spent weeks excitedly making plans for her 13th birthday - a day she would never get the chance to celebrate.  Image copyright FAMILY HANDOUT TO BBC Image caption Sneha was looking forward to celebrating her 13th birthday  ""She was like a little bird. She loved to dance. She danced to anything. If you asked her to dance, she would immediately jump into a sari or a long skirt and oblige,"" her mother, Nirasha Fernando says. Sneha, Ms Fernando and their neighbours Gayani and Tyronne all left together in Tyronne's auto-rickshaw.  Only Nirasha came back.  Sneha was among many children who died when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the church in the Negombo community of Katuwapitiya. At almost that precise moment five other locations, churches and hotels, were hit by bombers.  The softest of targets  It was the first thing that first responders I talked to noticed as soon as they walked into the churches that had been targeted: the large number of children among the dead. The overall number of casualties from the attacks is unclear but officials believe children could end up accounting for more than a fifth of the final death toll.  This is because the bombers' targets were the softest of them all - morning church services on a major religious festival and luxury hotels where families settled down to Sri Lanka's generous breakfast buffets.  Now Sneha's mother Nirasha gazes in anguish at her daughter's photo. Part of the bomb embedded itself in her upper lip - a constant irritant, a permanent physical mark and reminder of her loss.  Image caption Banners are up all around the city of Negombo - this banner commemorates Sneha  ""We called her duwani (daughter) at home. She was my first. I rocked her to sleep... I held her in my hands... I brought her up with so much love and now she's gone.""  They were in the third pew of the church - very close to the front - when the bomb went off. The damage to Sneha's body was so severe she was brought home in a sealed casket.  ""I couldn't even see her face,"" Nirasha says blankly.  Image caption Part of the bomb has embedded itself into Nirasha Fernando's upper lip - a constant reminder of the violence of that day  A hall in another Negombo home hosts an unbearable scene. Four open caskets lie next to each other. Three contain bodies of children: siblings Rashini Praveesha aged 14, Shalomi Himaya, nine, and Shalom Shathiska who was seven.  Shocked relatives keep walking into the house as though to confirm the truth of what they are seeing.  An elderly relative enters and immediately becomes incoherent with grief. ""Shalom! Shalom! Our youngest, our baby,"" she says, almost falling on to his coffin. ""You were always so naughty, you always loved playing tricks on us. Get up my baby, please get up!""  Relatives rush in and take her away, even as she keeps shouting.  It is a similar story in the eastern coastal town of Batticaloa on the other side of the country. Like Negombo, Batticaloa is adorned with banners strung up to commemorate the dead, many of them children.  'He went to get a drink of water'  Among them is the banner for 13-year-old John Jesuran Jayaratnam dressed in his finest red shirt and braces. He had just finished his Sunday school lesson. His mother tells the BBC she had been standing outside with him as they waited to enter the Zion church for Easter service.  He told her he would get a drink of water from the fountain and come back. That was the last time she saw him.  Outside John's house, a basketball hoop attached to a dusty wall sways in the breeze.  Image caption The banners take pains to show the children in their Sunday best - this is hung outside John Jesuran Jayaratnam's home  ""He used to love basketball. I used to sit here and watch him play,"" his mother says, as she stares out of the living room window. The youngest of three sons, John was her baby and a regular worshipper at the church.  For Sri Lankans the loss of so many children has been one of the most defining features of these attacks. It is not the bombers who are the subject of conversation - but the children. In the days immediately after the attacks, versions of events involving the children began to circulate on WhatsApp and Facebook, in family conversations and even during exchanges in the street.  They were narratives about the children who died. People began saying there were so many of them because bombs exploded as children were called up for a blessing, or because a choir was at the front when the bombs hit, or that they had all been dressed as angels.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""My heart shattered when I saw the bodies""  It has been difficult to confirm such details - and few of these stories appear to have any foundation.  One survivor of the Negombo attack told me that so many women and children were among the casualties only because they sat inside, where it was cooler, while the men stood outside.  But the narratives about the children kept spreading.  The first 'innocent' generation  Counselling psychologist Nivendra Uduman says such narratives can take hold for a number of reasons - it could be seen as a way of feeling useful at a time of crisis, an important way to connect.  Whatever the reason, it was the images of innocence that gripped the public imagination.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Candles are lit at the funeral of a young girl in Negombo. This is the first instance of mass violence children under the 10 have had to contend with in Sri Lanka  In Sri Lanka, however, these children also represented what could be called the first ""innocent"" generation. War, division and brutality were not part of their daily diet.  In just a few weeks, the country is due to mark 10 years from the end of a 30-year civil war between government forces and separatist Tamil militants. It was a conflict that saw bomb attacks unleashed across the country and brutal violence meted out by both sides.  The ""pre-war"" generations witnessed two bloody Marxist insurrections - first in the late 1970s, then in the late '80s and early '90s, which saw massive and violent disruptions to daily life, including months-long shutdowns of schools. A brutal retaliation from the government saw even more bloodshed.  So the deaths of so many of these children on Easter Sunday felt especially poignant because this was the first generation for decades for whom violence wasn't part of their day-to-day lives. That's not to say there wasn't strife - there have been anti-Muslim riots and attacks on churches. Religious tensions were on the rise albeit never on this scale. However, the bloodshed that regularly affected Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims of generations before had all but gone.  For Dr Ajith Danthanarayana, director of Lady Ridgeway children's hospital in Colombo, the aftermath of the bomb attacks are a bitter reminder of the past.  ""These are all children. There is no race, no religion. We have faced 30 years of war, and also the tsunami. We faced so many bad things and we managed to tolerate and do the best for our patients. That's all we can do.""  On the ward, it's a similar sentiment.  ""At least I was used to this. We all either knew or heard of people who had been killed in violence, and we constantly saw pictures on TV and in the newspapers. But how can I explain this to my son? How will he even process it?"" Wasantha Fernando asks me, while standing at his son's bedside at the hospital.  Image caption Akalanka, 7, has a ball bearing embedded in his muscle but still doesn't fully comprehend what has happened to him  Seven-year-old Akalanka was among those injured at St Sebastian's church. An iron ball bearing had ripped into his leg, fracturing the bone and embedding itself into his muscle. He was being discharged that day, but still had no clear idea of why he was in hospital.  ""He has heard us use the word bomb and is asking us what it means. I have told him that it is something that makes a loud noise like a firecracker. He doesn't know that it can hurt or cause death. But I will have to say something to him, because so many of his friends and peers are gone,"" Mr Fernando says.  Rumours worry children  This represents the second big challenge to a population already reeling from the brutality of these attacks. How do they explain it to their children, many of whom are already traumatised?  Dr Gadambanathan, the consultant psychiatrist at the Batticaloa Hospital, visited some of the injured children immediately after the attacks.  His staff had identified a range of immediate challenges - panic attacks, sleep disturbances and nightmares, worries about facial disfigurement due to injuries, parents overwhelmed by grief who were unable to care for their remaining children, or adults who struggled to communicate the loss of a sibling or parent to a child.  A mental health and psychosocial support worker in Batticaloa, who does not wish to be identified, says the most obvious impact was on those children directly connected to the attacks. However, watching videos of the attacks, experiencing the panic induced by rumours or perceiving the fears of the adults around them could also affect children quite distant from events, he says.  ""I have been in contact with parents from across the island whose children have been terrified by the thought that bombers may target their homes or towns, who are unable to sleep, who have questions about why this happened, or who are expressing strong feelings of anger towards the perpetrators,"" he said.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A number of organisations are trying to help adults talk to their children about what happened  A number of organisations including Unicef have been putting out guidelines to help adults talk to their children about what happened in an age-appropriate way. These have been shared widely on social media and also with parents and medical staff in hospitals as well as teachers.  In fact, returning to school, experts say, is another good way to help children process such events. Dayani Samarakoon, who teaches children between seven and 12 at a Colombo school, describes how she had been preparing for the return of her students. Her approach, she says, depends on the age group.  ""The youngest ones may or may not know some of what has happened. I will get them to talk to me about what they know. Some of what they know could be the truth while the rest could be hearsay. But the important thing is to hear them out and listen to their fears,"" she says.  The extent to which such services are freely available is unclear. In Sri Lanka, seeking help for mental health conditions is still considered taboo and adults - many themselves traumatised - may not have the necessary tools to comfort their children.  'Why couldn't one of you stay?'  But in the meantime, loss and funerals still consume the living.  Back in Negombo, a woman wails in anguish, beating her chest in agony. She has lost her husband and both her children in the St Sebastian's attack. Her daughter Sachini Appuhami was 21, and Vimukthi, her son, was 14.  Her brother-in-law Jude Prasad says both children were bright students. Sachini had finished secondary school and was doing a course in accounting. Vimukthi, apparently never had to be nagged to do his homework.  Image copyright FAMILY HANDOUT/BBC Image caption Siblings Sachini and Vimukthi pictured when they were much younger  ""We tried so many times to get them interested in sports, but they were much more interested in their books,"" he says smiling. Yet Vimukthi, he adds, also had a keen interest in music.  ""When he passed his standard five examinations, he asked his father for that,"" he says his voice breaking, pointing to the mezzanine floor above with an elaborate drum set.  ""My brother and I went all the way to Wennappuwa (a large town 21km away) to get this for him. He really loved it.""  Just then, another relative walks in and heads straight to a wall on which framed photographs of the family are displayed.  She touches the faces of the two children in a photo taken when they were much younger. ""Why couldn't even one of you live for your mother?"" she demands, growing increasingly hysterical. ""Why couldn't at least one of you stay?""  Additional reporting in Batticaloa from the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan",en,terrorattack,,

Mark Steven Domingo, 26, who had combat experience in Afghanistan and professed to be Muslim, faces federal terror-related charges for plotting to detonate an improvised explosive device (IED) at a white nationalist rally in Long Beach this past weekend with the aim of causing mass casualties, officials said.  Advertisement  Domingo was arrested on Friday after receiving what he thought was a live bomb packed with nails that was delivered by an undercover agent.  According to court documents, in online posts and conversations with an FBI source Domingo expressed support for violent militancy and aspired to become a martyr by seeking retribution for attacks against Muslims.  After considering various options - including targeting Jews, churches, and police officers - Domingo decided to detonate an IED at the Long Beach rally, which ended up not taking place, authorities said.  ""This investigation successfully disrupted a very real threat posed by a trained combat soldier who repeatedly stated he wanted to cause the maximum number of casualties,"" said US Attorney Nick Hanna.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Domingo, who served in Afghanistan between September 2012 and January 2013, in one message posted to a private group online in early March referred to a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017 that left 58 dead.  ""America needs another Vegas event ... that would give them the taste of terror they gladly spread all over the world,"" he said.  In another posting on Mar 14, he wrote: ""There were mosque shootings in New Zealand. There must be retribution.""  Authorities said he was referring to the New Zealand mosques massacre the previous day in which 50 people were killed.  After several weeks of plotting with an undercover FBI informant and considering various targets, Domingo finally set his sights on the rally in Long Beach and bought several hundred 7.6-centimetre nails to be used as shrapnel inside an explosive device ""because they would be long enough to penetrate the human body and puncture internal organs,"" the complaint says.  He was arrested after an undercover officer handed him inert devices and the pair traveled to the Long Beach park where the rally was set to take place to conduct surveillance.  ""I'm extremely glad to be announcing that we interdicted a potential terrorist attack, rather than outlining the FBI's response to yet another tragedy,"" said Paul Delacourt, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office.  ""At no time was the public in danger and there is currently no known threat to public safety.""  Domingo has been charged with providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists. He faces up to 15 years in prison on the charge.  He was due to make an initial appearance on court later on Monday.  ",en,terrorattack,676,"['US', 'LA']"

""There could be another wave of attacks,"" the head of the police Ministerial Security Division said in a letter to lawmakers and other officials seen by Reuters.  Officials said the militants behind last Sunday's suicide bombings on hotels and churches, which killed more than 250 people, could be planning to use military disguises.  ""The relevant information further notes that persons dressed in military uniforms and using a van could be involved in the attacks,"" the letter said.  Five locations were targeted for the attacks, which were to be carried out on Sunday or yesterday, security sources said.  There were no attacks on Sunday and security across Sri Lanka has been ramped up, with scores of suspected militants arrested.  The authorities believe Zaharan Hashim, the founder of the little-known National Thowheeth Jama'ath, was the mastermind of the Easter Sunday attacks and one of the nine suicide bombers.  Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a tight-knit group was involved, mostly friends and families who spoke face to face, possibly to evade electronic surveillance.  President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday announced the government has banned women from wearing face veils.  The authorities said the move would help security forces identify people, as a hunt for any remaining attackers and their support network continues across the Indian Ocean island.  ""The ban is to ensure national security... No one should obscure their faces to make identification difficult,"" the statement said.  It came days after local Islamic clerics urged Muslim women not to cover their faces amid fears of backlash, after the bombings by militants affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  Separately, Mr Wickremesinghe, who is feuding with Mr Sirisena, issued a statement saying he had asked the justice minister to draft regulations to ban the burqa.  But the moves have led to concerns within the Muslim community that a prolonged ban could fuel tensions in the religiously diverse nation, which emerged from a civil war with ethnic minority Tamil separatists a decade ago.  The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU), the top body of Islamic scholars in Sri Lanka, said it supported a short-term ban on security grounds, but opposed any attempt to legislate against burqas.  ""We have given guidance to the Muslim women to not cover their faces in this emergency situation,"" ACJU assistant manager Farhan Faris said, after the scholars asked the government to drop plans for a law against the burqa and niqab.  ""If you make it a law, people will become emotional and this will bring another bad impact... It is their religious right,"" he told Reuters.  About 9.7 per cent of Sri Lanka's roughly 22 million people are Muslim. Only a small minority of women, usually in Muslim areas, fully hide their faces.  The Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, yesterday said there remained insufficient security around churches in the island, and urged the authorities to ensure their safety.  Many Sri Lankans believe the rift between Mr Sirisena and Mr Wickremesinghe has undermined national security.  Mr Sirisena fired Mr Wickremesinghe last year after months of tension, only to be forced to reinstate him under pressure from the Supreme Court.  Since then, their relationship has deteriorated further to the point where their factions actively try to undermine each other, such as by not sharing security information, defence sources say.  Mr Sirisena said yesterday he had appointed Mr Chandana Wickramaratne, the second in command at the police, as acting police chief.  Over the weekend, sources at the President's office told Reuters that Mr Pujith Jayasundara, the police chief appointed by Mr Wickremesinghe, was refusing the President's request to step down for not sharing details of the attacks.  ""Since there is an investigation into his possible failure in preventing the attacks, Jayasundara has been sent on compulsory leave,"" a source close to the President told Reuters. The President has also appointed General Shantha Kottegoda as the new defence secretary, replacing Mr Hemasiri Fernando, who resigned after the bombings.  Mr Kottegoda, 69, was an army commander between 2004 and 2005. He was instrumental in weakening the Tamil Tiger rebels by breaking away an allied group.

A criminal complaint said he had been planning since March to ""manufacture and use a weapon of mass destruction in order to commit mass murder.""  U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna told a news conference that Domingo supported violent jihad and spoke about becoming a martyr and of pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group if it established a presence in the United States.

He discussed picking off Jews walking to synagogue, shooting police officers or attacking a church or military base, according to investigators.  When the source asked him how he planned to carry out violence without getting caught, court records said Domingo replied: ""Martyrdom, bro.""  He also allegedly discussed killing a neighbor he was upset with as a prelude to broader violence and later contemplated bombing the Santa Monica Pier, where he said a summer attack on the crowded tourist spot would maximize casualties because people wouldn't be able to escape the blast in the enclosed space.  Eventually, he settled on the idea of planting an improvised explosive device that would be remotely triggered or detonated by a timer at a white supremacist event, investigators said. The confidential source connected him with a purported bomb maker who was actually an undercover police officer.  Domingo bought 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) of nails long enough to puncture internal organs and provided them to the bomb maker, though the resulting contraption contained only inert materials, authorities said.  If he survived the planned bombing, Domingo allegedly discussed launching further attacks on the Long Beach Port or on a train.  The plot was thwarted just two days ahead of the event, investigators said, when an FBI SWAT team arrested Domingo after he was given the pressure cookers and surveyed Bluff Park in Long Beach, where the rally was supposed to happen.  White nationalists, however, never showed up at the park Sunday. Instead, a large group of counter protesters demonstrated for peace.  Phone and email messages seeking comment from the public defender representing Domingo were not immediately returned. A voicemail left at a phone number listed for Domingo was not returned.  A statement from his family asked for privacy.  ""We do not know what is going on at this point,"" the statement said. ""We are surprised by all of these events in regard with Mark.""  The suspect's younger brother told reporters outside the family's Los Angeles home that Mark Domingo had converted to Islam in recent months.  ""Like anybody else, I don't want to assume a thing when someone joins a new religion,"" James Domingo said. ""If anything, I thought it was a good thing. I thought maybe my brother finally found some sort of guidance in this world.""  James Domingo declined to speculate on whether his brother was guilty, only saying he would ""wait for the trial.""  Domingo is believed to have acted alone and authorities said the public was not at risk. After Domingo was identified online by the FBI, he was under surveillance around the clock, said Ryan Young, the FBI special agent in charge of counter terrorism at the Los Angeles office.  ""Our biggest fear is this was a rapid what we call 'radicalization to mobilization to violence,'"" Young said. ""Sometimes we get asked 'What keeps you up at night?' This is a case that keeps us up at night.""  While Domingo had appeared committed to carry out the plot, court papers portray him as suddenly reluctant as the bomb plot came together.  He told the others he thought were his confederates they should consider postponing so he could finish reading the Quran and experience the Muslim holy month of Ramadan beginning in May.  Last Wednesday, he told the confidential source he wanted to think about it for a night.  ""Let's just sleep on it,"" he said, according to court papers. ""If we're still as motivated ... I'll give the go-ahead.""  The next day he sent a message to the supposed bomb maker that the plan was on. The two referred to the bombs as ""presents"" they needed to wrap for a party.  ""Keep the presents somewhere safe lol,"" Domingo wrote back Friday morning before making plans to meet that night.  ___  Associated Press reporters Christopher Weber and John Antczak contributed to this report.",en,terrorattack,,

Major General Asif Ghafoor, speaking at a press conference at the military's headquarters in the northern city of Rawalpindi on Monday, levelled allegations that the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) had been funded by India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the Afghan intelligence agency, National Directorate for Security (NDS).  ""The way they are playing into the hands of others, their time is up,"" he said, in the military's most forceful statement yet against a group that has faced arbitrary detentions, treason charges against its leaders and a blanket ban on media coverage of its events.  ""No one will be hurt and nothing illegal will be done. Everything will be done according to the law. Whatever liberties you could take, you have taken.""  https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/pakistan-youth-seek-justice-mehsud-naqeebullah-180206104522328.html  PTM leaders denied the charges, saying they were ready to present the group's accounts before parliament or other accountability bodies to be examined.  ""These accusations are being levelled against us only because we are demanding accountability,"" said Mohsin Dawar, a PTM leader and member of parliament, on the floor of Pakistan's National Assembly hours after Ghafoor's press conference.  ""We want accountability for targeted killings, for extrajudicial killings, for missing persons, people who have been held without charge or crime by the government. Whenever anyone speaks of these issues, they are accused of being foreign funded.""  Alleged rights abuses  The PTM shot to prominence in January last year, when a long march launched to protest the extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a young Pashtun cloth seller in Karachi, attracted thousands of supporters.  The group, whose leadership is composed of rights activists from the war-torn tribal districts where Pakistan waged the bulk of its war against the Pakistan Taliban (TTP) armed group and its allies, has long agitated for accountability for alleged rights abuses committed during that fight.  Since 2007, Pakistan has launched a series of military operations, mainly in the tribal districts, targeting the TTP and its allies, who sought to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law on the country.  An operation launched in 2014 has been successful in displacing the TTP from its previous strongholds into neighbouring Afghanistan. But while violence has fallen, sporadic attacks continue to target security forces and civilians. Pakistan says it has lost at least 6,000 soldiers in those military operations.  180205091656542  The PTM has three main demands: the clearance of land mines and other unexploded ordnance from the tribal districts; an end to extrajudicial killings in Pakistan's war against armed groups; and accountability for thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearances by the state.  On Monday, military spokesperson Ghafoor said the state had been working to resolve each of these issues.  He said that 48 teams of military engineers had cleared at least 45 percent of the tribal districts of landmines and other ordnance. At least 101 casualties had occurred during the effort, he said.  Pending cases  On enforced disappearances, he said that a government commission of inquiry was working on resolving the cases, according to the law.  At least 2,181 cases remain pending before the government's commission of inquiry, according to the commission's data.  Many of the 3,659 cases the commission has disposed of have been traced to missing people being held in government custody in a network of internment centres where they may be held without charges indefinitely under a draconian security law.  Ghafoor levelled allegations of both RAW and NDS funding of specific PTM events and protests held since January last year.  180418080944584  ""The only thing is that we are aware of the issues of the people from your areas, otherwise dealing with you wouldn't be difficult,"" he warned.  Earlier this month, PTM held a rally that attracted thousands of supporters to protest against renewed violence in the North Waziristan tribal district, once the headquarters of the TTP.  ""No amount of provocation will deter us from our peaceful protest,"" tweeted PTM leader Dawar on Monday. ""Our recent Miranshah [rally] was an example of its success. Not only did it strengthen our resolve it has also delivered a message.  ""Would just like to remind that our time is not up, it has just started.""

The FLN has said that it was attacking Rwanda to oust long-serving president Paul Kagame. In December, the FLN claimed responsibility for an attack on passenger buses in Nyungwe forest near the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s border with Burundi.

Researchers did dental exams for 755 children in 1980, when they were eight years old on average, then followed them through 2007 to see how many of them developed risk factors for heart attacks and strokes like high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, high blood sugar, and hardening of the arteries.  Advertisement  Overall, just 33 kids, or 4.5 percent, had no signs of bleeding, cavities, fillings, or pockets around teeth that can signal gum disease. Almost six percent of the kids had one of these four signs of oral infections, while 17 percent had two signs, 38 percent had three signs, and 34 percent had all four signs.  Kids who had even one sign of oral infection were 87 percent more likely to develop what's known as subclinical atherosclerosis: structural changes and thickening in the artery walls that isn't yet serious enough to cause complications.  Children with all four signs of poor oral health were 95 percent more likely to develop this type of artery damage.  Oral infections are among the most common causes of inflammation-induced diseases worldwide, and periodontal disease in adults have long been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, researchers note in JAMA Network Open.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Most people get cavities and gum disease for the first time in childhood, and these conditions can develop into more serious infections and tooth loss if they aren't properly treated, the study authors note. Treating these oral health problems in childhood can also reduce inflammation and other risk factors for hardening of the arteries.  ""This emphasizes how important good oral hygiene and frequent check-ups with a dentist starting early in life are for general health,"" said lead study author Pirkko Pussinen of the University of Helsinki in Finland.  ""The children with a healthy mouth had a better cardiovascular risk profile (lower blood pressure, body mass index, glucose, and cholesterol) throughout the whole follow-up period,"" Pussinen said by email.  More than four in five kids had cavities and fillings, and 68 percent of them also had bleeding during dental exams. Slight pocketing around the gums was observed in 54 percent of the kids, although it was more often found in boys than in girls.  Both cavities and pocketing that can signal gum disease were associated with thickening of walls of the carotid arteries, blood vessels in the neck that carry blood from the heart to the brain. This indicates the progression of atherosclerosis and an increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.  The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how cavities or other oral health problems might directly cause heart attacks or strokes. Not everyone with subclinical atherosclerosis or other risk factors will go on to have a heart attack or stroke.  Poor oral health in childhood was also associated with an increase in blood pressure and body mass index in early adulthood, noted co-author of an accompanying editorial Dr. Salim Virani of Baylor College of Medicine and the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston.  ""These could themselves be associated with poor heart health in adulthood,"" Virani said by email. Systemic inflammation associated with poor oral health is also linked to heart disease and stroke, Virani added.  ""Either the relationship shown in this study is causal or there are yet unmeasured confounders (risk factors) that are associated with both poor oral health as well as future risk of cardiovascular disease,"" Virani said. ""For example, could poor oral health be a marker of poor nutrition which itself is associated with cardiovascular disease, or could poor oral health be a marker of lower socioeconomic status which itself may be associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease in the future?""

Police had accused the man, Khaled Khayat, and another brother, Mahmoud Khayat, of planning two terrorist attacks that also included a chemical gas attack on the flight to Abu Dhabi in July 2017, police said.  The third brother was unaware that he was carrying a bomb, disguised as a meat mincer, in his luggage, as he tried to check in at the airport, police said.  But the device was taken out of his luggage when it was deemed too heavy and the bomb never made it past airport security.  Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat were arrested weeks later after a series of raids in Sydney.  ""The jury this afternoon returned a guilty verdict for Khaled and is still deliberating in respect of Mahmoud,"" a spokeswoman for the New South Wales Supreme Court said.  Police had alleged that high-grade military explosives used to make the bomb were sent by air cargo from Turkey as part of a plot ""inspired and directed"" by ISIS.  Khaled's sentence hearing has been set for July 26. The charges carry a maximum punishment of life in prison.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in November the likelihood of a terror attack in Australia remained at the""probable"" level, after a fatal stabbing in Melbourne that police said was inspired by Islamic State.  Australia has a five-level terror threat ranking system and""probable"" is its midpoint. The threat likelihood has been set at probable since the system was introduced in 2015.

The UN sanctions committee on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) and al-Qaeda announced in a press release the designation of Azhar - the chief of Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) - over his ties to al-Qaeda.  JeM claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir that killed 40 Indian troops and stoked tensions between India and Pakistan.  China had blocked three previous attempts by the sanctions committee to blacklist Azhar and put a technical hold on a fourth request from Britain, France and the United States in March.  JeM itself has been on the UN's ""terrorist"" list since 2001.  190223070842079  Under the decision, Azhar, considered the founder of JeM, will be subject to an assets freeze, global ban and arms embargo.

UN diplomats said the request was again submitted to the committee and China had not opposed the move to blacklist Azhar.  'India in safe hands'  The US had put forward a draft Security Council resolution to blacklist Azhar, ratcheting up pressure on China to remove its opposition to the sanctions.  India applauded the move, which came after its air force carried out air attacks on a JeM camp inside Pakistan in February - the first time since 1971 it hit territory beyond divided Kashmir.  Finance Minister Arun Jaitley posted on Twitter: ""India stands vindicated. Masood Azhar is now a global terrorist. India is in safe hands.

Best known for the distinctive hoarse cough it produces, croup is caused by a virus and is typically contagious during the first few days of the infection. Its spread can be prevented through good hand hygiene and good cough hygiene, the authors write.  Advertisement  ""Often trigged by a virus such as the common cold, croup in younger children creates a cough that is described as a seal-like bark, which can be scary for families to hear,"" said Dr. Elliot Melendez of the Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, who co-wrote the patient resource.  Croup causes swelling of the larynx, or voice box, and the trachea, and its clinical name is laryngotracheitis. The inflammation can affect's a child's voice and ability to breathe.  ""If not treated, it can lead to severe respiratory distress,"" Melendez told Reuters Health in a phone interview. ""This progression can have a psychological impact on families.""  The new patient page (available for free, here: https://bit.ly/2GB68df) explains the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment options for croup.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Melendez and co-author Ioana Baiu of Stanford Hospital in California explain that croup typically occurs in the fall and winter months and is caused by the flu or parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus or other respiratory viruses. Like many respiratory infections, croup starts with a runny nose, fever and sore throat. Within a day or two, larynx swelling increases and leads to a characteristic ""croupy"" cough.  The cough is not dangerous, the authors emphasize. However, more severe forms of the infection can make it hard to breathe, causing a strained sound called stridor as air passes through the child's narrowed airway. This is typically accompanied by rapid, shallow and labored breathing, and the child's nostrils flare up and the ribs can be seen with each inhalation.  ""Croup has seasonal variations like any other virus, and since the early symptoms may look like the common cold, it's important for parents to be aware of developments and changes to ensure the correct diagnosis,"" Melendez said.  Diagnosis is made based on symptoms and the characteristic cough. Testing for specific viruses with a swab can help but isn't often necessary. In addition, an X-ray scan of the neck may distinguish croup from other causes but is rarely needed.  Similar to other viral upper respiratory infections, the recommended treatment for croup is supportive care. Mild infections can be managed at home with over-the-counter pain relievers, and cool mist may make breathing more comfortable. It's also important to make sure the child stays hydrated.  ""Croup is usually self-limited, but it's also important to know when to seek care once a child shows signs of respiratory distress,"" said Dr. Angela Mattke, a pediatrician at the Mayo Clinic's Children's Center and host of the ""Ask The Mayo Mom"" videos on Youtube.  Signs of respiratory distress include inspiratory stridor, labored breathing, bluish lips or decreased alertness. Pediatricians or emergency department doctors may use nebulized epinephrine to decrease inflammation and open the airway to allow better breathing, and steroids may be given as well.  Most children improve after one dose of epinephrine or steroids, although about 10 percent of kids may require further hospitalization for repeat doses and hydration.  In the rarest cases, a child may need a breathing tube until the infection subsides, and the infection may affect deeper structures of the lower airways or the lungs. A bacterial infection may also occur on top of the virus, which can require hospitalization and antibiotics, although these more severe infections typically affect immunocompromised children or those with underlying diseases such as asthma.  Melendez and Baiu provide links on the JAMA patient page to more information about croup from the Mayo Clinic and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  After the virus that caused croup clears, the cough may linger for a few weeks.  ""It's important to teach kids how to wash their hands and how to cough into their arm rather than hands,"" Mattke told Reuters Health by phone. ""We typically see this in children in daycare and preschool, and it's important to keep your kids healthy with proper hygiene, nutrition and sleep.""

The UAE, along with Egypt, support Haftar who they see as a bulwark against Islamist militants in North Africa. A 2017 U.N. report said the Gulf Arab state has provided his eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) with military and logistical support.  Haftar's offensive launched more than three weeks ago to seize Tripoli has all but wrecked U.N.-backed efforts for a peace deal between the rival factions to end eight years of conflict.  ""Priority in Libya (is) to counter extremism/terrorism and support stability in long drawn out crisis,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said in a Twitter post.  ""Abu Dhabi agreement offered opportunity to support the U.N.-led process. Meanwhile extremist militias continue to control capital and derail search for political solution.""  Abu Dhabi, which has voiced support for U.N. peace efforts, last February hosted talks between Prime Minister Fayez Seraj and Haftar, the military commander of Libya's eastern half, where the two agreed on the need for national elections.  The assault by the LNA, the biggest military confrontation in Libya since the 2011 toppling of leader Muammar Gaddafi, stalled on Tripoli's stoutly defended southern outskirts last week. But fighting has intensified again, with both sides using artillery.  The U.N. report issued in June 2017 said HaftarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces had received aircraft and military vehicles from the UAE, which also built up an air base at Al Khadim, allowing the LNA, which is allied to a parallel government based in the eastern city of Benghazi, to gain air superiority by 2016.  A Gulf source has told Reuters that the UAE had provided logistical support to Haftar to safeguard Egypt's security following cross-border militant attacks.

Earlier this week Washington warned violence in the buffer zone Ã¢â‚¬Å“will result in the destabilisation of the regionÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Since Tuesday the Russian and Syrian military attacks have forced thousands of civilians to flee to camps further north along the Turkish border and damaged four medical facilities, according to Idlib civil defence officials and a U.S. medical aid organisation working in the area.

Syrian army helicopters have dropped barrel bombs, which are drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel that cause indiscriminate destruction, killing at least 15 civilians and injured dozens, rescuers in Idlib province said.  Opposition-run civil defence agencies say hundreds of people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Russian and Syrian strikes since the September deal which prevented a potentially devastating offensive on Idlib and nearby areas controlled by rebels and now home to over 3 million people.  Syrian state media, quoting army sources, blamed rebels for the attacks and said it had targeted Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorist groupsÃ¢â‚¬Â in towns in northern Hama including Kfr Nabouda.  Turkey, which has supported the rebels and has troops to monitor the truce, has been negotiating with Moscow to halt the strikes with little success.

Sudanese protesters are looking to step up pressure on the army three weeks after the ouster of leader Omar al-Bashir  The two sides have agreed on forming a joint civilian-military council to rule Sudan but are at odds over its composition.  Protest leaders from the Alliance for Freedom and Change say the army is not serious about handing power to civilians, three weeks after it toppled veteran president Omar al-Bashir.  The army has been pushing for a 10-member council including seven military representatives and three civilians.  The alliance is demanding a council made up of eight civilians and seven generals.  The disagreement prompted the alliance to announce a ""million-strong march to assert our main demand, which is for civilian rule"".  The call has exacerbated tensions between the two sides.  ""We expect the march to draw huge crowds tody,"" said Ahmed al-Rabia, a leader from the protest movement.  The military council has warned it will not allow ""chaos"" and urged protesters to dismantle makeshift barricades they have set up around the main protest site outside army headquarters.  It also demanded protesters open roads and bridges blocked by demonstrators who have camped outside the headquarters for weeks, even after Bashir's ouster.  The march itself was not expected to get under way until mid-afternoon, when the worst of the midday heat had passed.  But the protesters camped in the square outside army headquarters kept up a festive atmosphere with loudspeakers blaring out revolutionary songs and vendors selling fruit and peanuts, an AFP correspondent reported.  - 'Asking for trouble' -  As both sides in the standoff remained intransigent, they held separate news conferences on Tuesday to explain their divergent views.  ""The military council is not serious about handing over power to civilians,"" said Mohamed Naji al-Assam, a leader of the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) spearheading the protests.  ""The military council insists that the (joint) council should be military-led with civilian representation,"" Assam said, adding the army had been seeking to ""expand its powers daily"".  In an interview with AFP on Wednesday, Sudan's main opposition leader Sadiq al-Mahdi warned protest leaders against provoking the military.  ""If we provoke the... armed forces which contributed to the change, we would be asking for trouble,"" he said.  The military council's deputy head Mohammad Hamdan Dagolo has said it is ""committed to negotiations but (will allow) no chaos"".  Hamdan, widely knowns as Himeidti, and some of his colleagues spoke of incidents since the protests first broke out in December including looting and burning of markets.  He said across the country six security personnel had been killed during protests on Monday.  The spokesman of the military council, Lieutenant General Shamseddin al-Kabbashi, said the ""armed forces must remain in the sovereign council"" because of tensions facing the country.  In a breakthrough on Saturday, the two sides agreed to form a joint civilian-military body to pave the way for detailed negotiations on a roadmap for the formation of a civilian government.  But Rabia said on Thursday that no date had been set for further talks with the military council to iron out their remaining differences.  The protesters have won support from Western governments for their demands.  But Gulf Arab states have provided the military council with a three billion dollar (2.7 billion euro) credit lifeline to support an ""orderly"" transition.  The African Union on Tuesday gave Sudan's military rulers another 60 days to hand over power to a civilian authority or face suspension, after an earlier deadline was missed.",en,terrorattack,,

""We have arrested a doctor after receiving complaints from the health authorities,"" said Kamran Nawaz, the local police chief heading the case in the southern city of Larkana, on Friday.  ""We are told that the doctor also has HIV,"" he said.  190112193247959  Authorities were first alerted last week after 18 children living on the outskirts of the city tested positive for the virus, which causes AIDS, prompting health officials to carry out wider screenings. Dozens of more infections were found.  ""More than 90 people have tested HIV-positive and the number of children is around 65,"" Dr Abdul Rehaman, a district health official in Larkana, told AFP news agency.  A second official confirmed the outbreak, although gave slightly different figures.  Authorities said they traced the outbreak to a single doctor, who appears to have been using a contaminated syringe on patients.  Azra Pechuho, Sindh province's health minister, confirmed his arrest. ""The blood of the parents of the infected children was also tested, but their results were negative,"" he said.  Officials have since launched an even larger testing and education drive.

The Ministry of Public Health said in its latest update on Friday that 14 new deaths from the virus were recorded, taking the toll to 1,008 deaths from more than 1,450 confirmed cases registered since the epidemic erupted in August.  The ministry's update came after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned earlier on Friday that health officials were ""anticipating a scenario of continued intense transmission"" after 126 confirmed cases were reported over a seven-day stretch ending on Sunday, a record for the current outbreak.  Health ministry spokeswoman Jessica Ilunga said the surge in cases was the result of attacks on health workers and treatment centres disrupting ""response activities"" in recent weeks.  ""Security has been a big issue, and every time we have an incident, essential response activities such as contact tracing, vaccination and safe burials are suspended for an indefinite period of time, giving time and space for the virus to spread,"" Ilunga told Al Jazeera.  Repeated attacks  The DRC's current Ebola outbreak, its tenth to date, emerged in eastern North Kivu province last year before spreading to the neighbouring Ituri province.  In a bid to contain the outbreak, health workers have inoculated more than 109,000 people to date as part of a government-backed vaccination programme. The vaccine is experimental, but is estimated to be 97.5 percent effective.  Efforts to beat back the virus have been hampered by ongoing unrest in the eastern DRC, however, and widespread distrust among elements of the local population towards both the central government, which postponed presidential and legislative elections in parts of the region blaming the Ebola outbreak, as well as the medical strategies deployed by emergency responders.  190328062938247  Scores of armed groups operate in the conflict-wracked region, including in the areas surrounding the North Kivu cities of Beni and Butembo, where the current outbreak is concentrated.  Ebola treatment centres and health workers have repeatedly been subject to attacks, with 119 such incidents recorded since January, according to WHO.  On Friday, Michael Ryan, WHO's emergencies chief, warned at a press conference in the Swiss city of Geneva that insecurity had become a ""major impediment to ensuring that we can access, engage with and serve the communities we wish to serve in Ebola control"".  In April, heavily armed assailants raided a hospital in Butembo and killed Richard Mouzoko, a Cameroonian WHO doctor working on the Ebola response.  The assault came after unidentified attackers in February torched two of Doctors Without Borders' (MSF) treatment facilities in North Kivu, prompting the organisation to suspend operations in the area and warn soon after that ""a climate of deepening community mistrust"" was taking a grip amid ""various political, social and economic grievances"" and an allegedly overly militarised response by authorities to the outbreak.  Widespread mistrust  Christoph Vogel, a former UN expert on the DRC and a researcher with the UK-based London School of Economics' Conflict Research Programme, said there were a ""host of different factors"" complicating the medical response and warned the recent attacks showed the climate on the ground was ""extremely poisoned"".  ""It (the outbreak) is happening in an area that has witnessed entrenched armed conflict, massive violence and all sorts of distrust between different actors, communities and elites; this is probably the central factor that makes the outbreak so hard to tackle compared to other ones,"" Vogel told Al Jazeera.  Vogel cautioned it was not clear who was behind the attacks on health centres and medical professionals, but said international actors and DRC authorities should have done more to try and build trust with communities affected by the epidemic, pointing to widely held local views that the outbreak was fabricated to benefit business-owning local elites or further destabilise the region.  190309193641595  According to a recent study by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, some 32 percent of respondents in Ebola-hit regions of the eastern DRC said they did not believe the virus existed and was instead invented for financial gains. More than 36 percent believed the epidemic was fabricated to destabilise the area.  Fewer than two-thirds of the nearly 1,000 respondents said they would take a vaccine for Ebola.  Ilunga, for her part, admitted some people in the ""historically neglected"" eastern DRC ""didn't believe"" Ebola existed and said there were ""several types of attack"" being committed against health workers, all of which were ""detrimental"" to efforts to defeat the virus.  ""The majority of violence against the medical response is community violence, for instance when Ebola responders go to family homes because they have been alerted someone has died ... but when responders arrive some people chase them away,"" Ilunga said.  ""But the attacks on the Ebola treatment centres are more coordinated, by some kind of organised armed groups,"" she added. ""It is worrying, especially because the future of the outbreak depends on factors outside of our, the Ministry of Health's control.""  The failure to overcome the outbreak so far has seen it evolve into the second-deadliest in recorded history, trailing an epidemic between 2013-2016 that killed about 11,300 people in West Africa as it surged through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.",en,diseas,,

Aeroflot flight SU 1492 skidded down the runway at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, its rear section ablaze and spilling thick, black smoke.  Once the plane had come to a halt, passengers escaped using emergency slides from the plane's two forward doors, before running away from the burning aircraft.  Initial reports said the Superjet 100 was flying from Moscow to Murmansk, a Russian city in the Arctic circle, when an emergency on board forced it to turn back.  Russia's Interfax news agency reported that a ""loss of communication"" caused by a ""lightning strike"" had led to the decision to return to Sheremetyevo. No official cause has yet been provided for the disaster.  Data from flight tracker Flightradar24 shows the plane took off just after 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) and was in the air for just under 30 minutes, before making a loop in the skies north of Moscow and heading back to the airport.  Shocking video of the incident showed the plane approach the runway at speed before hitting the ground, causing it to launch back in the air before hitting the runway again and bursting into flames.

Thirty-seven people survived, five of whom are currently receiving treatment in hospital, said Elena Markovskaya, a spokeswoman for Russia's Investigative Committee, a top law-enforcement agency.  An American citizen was killed in the crash, Interfax reported.  A passenger in a plane waiting to depart Moscow posted video on Instagram purportedly showing fire crews attending the scene as the aircraft sat in flames on the runway.  Russian airline Aeroflot published an ""incomplete"" list of 33 survivors, including the names of the five passengers hospitalized. In a series of short statements on its website, it said the aircraft was evacuated in 55 seconds, compared with the ""industry norm"" of 90 seconds.  The flight crew ""did everything in its power to save passenger lives and provide emergency assistance to those involved,"" another short release said. ""Tragically, they were unable to save all of those aboard.""  The captain was the last to leave the burning aircraft, the airline added, and offered its condolences to the passengers and their families. It announced that it would fly relatives of those affected to Moscow without charge.  Russian-made jet  Sukhoi manufactures military aircraft and is known especially for its fighter jets. Its civilian aircraft, the Sukhoi Superjet 100, is the first post-Soviet commercial airliner to have been designed and built in Russia.  The Superjet is a relatively new aircraft, making its maiden flight in 2008 before entering service in mid-2011. More than 100 planes are in operation around the world, according to the company.  The narrow-bodied, dual-class cabin aircraft can transport 100 passengers over regional routes and is ""a fusion of Russia's famed aviation design and production skills with the latest systems from leading aerospace suppliers around the world,"" the aircraft's brochure says.  In 2012 a demonstration flight over Indonesia crashed in a remote, mountainous part of the country.  Earlier that year, a Superjet 100 operated by Aeroflot was forced to abandon its flight to Astrakhan, Russia and return to Moscow because of problems with the undercarriage, according to RIA Novosti.  A similar defect in another Aeroflot-operated Superjet 100 had to be fixed in Minsk the previous year.  The model achieved the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Type Certificate in 2012, and also holds safety certificates from a number of other aviation authorities.  Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said Monday that it does not plan to suspend the operation of Sukhoi Superjet aircraft, state news agency TASS reported.  Investigation ordered  Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a ""thorough investigation"" into the fiery emergency landing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.  ""All instructions have been given to conduct the most thorough investigation, (to carry out) the necessary orders to find out the cause of this accident,"" said Peskov, according to TASS.  He added that Putin ""extends his deep condolences to those who lost their near and dear in this incident.""  The Investigative Committee said in a statement Monday that it was examining ""various versions"" that might have caused the crash landing, including the qualifications of the pilots, air-traffic controllers and maintenance personnel, aircraft malfunction and adverse weather conditions.

The crash-landing on Sunday is the latest serious setback for the plane, the first new passenger jet developed in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, and threatens to undermine confidence in an airliner Moscow touts as proof it can produce its own high quality civil passenger aircraft.  In a blow to the Russian aviation industry, regional carrier Yamal Airlines, the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second biggest operator of the Superjet after Aeroflot, said on Monday it was cancelling its planned purchase of 10 of the planes, the TASS news agency reported. It cited high servicing costs, not safety concerns.  Investigators have started trying to piece together why the Aeroflot jet, which had been flying from Moscow to the northern Russian city of Murmansk on Sunday, was forced to make an emergency landing and why that landing went so badly wrong.  Various versions are being looked into, including technical failure, human error, and bad weather conditions.  Asked by reporters at a news conference if the Sukhoi planes should now be grounded pending the outcome of the investigation, Yevgeny Ditrikh, RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transport minister, said:  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are no grounds for that.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Television footage from Sunday showed the plane catching fire on the runway at MoscowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sheremtyevo airport as it made a bumpy emergency landing.  The plane had been carrying 73 passengers and five crew members. For a graphic on the trajectory of the doomed flight, click: tmsnrt.rs/2WtF7zh  Ditrikh said the bodies of 41 people killed in the accident had been recovered. Thirty-three passengers and four crew members had survived, he said. Six of the survivors were in a serious condition and receiving treatment. One U.S. citizen was killed in the incident, the U.S. authorities said.  The plane, built in RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Far East in August 2017, had been serviced as recently as April this year.  Aeroflot has long shaken off its troubled post-Soviet safety record and now has one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most modern fleets on international routes where it relies mostly on Boeing and Airbus aircraft.  However Aeroflot also owns at least 50 Superjets which it operates on both domestic and international routes and has pledged to buy 100 more.  The Superjet, which first entered service in 2011, has been hit by sporadic concerns over safety and reliability, including a December 2016 grounding after a defect was discovered in an aircraftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tail section.  Slideshow (11 Images)  Interjet Airlines, a Mexican low-cost airline, said in a statement on Sunday it also operated five Superjets Ã¢â‚¬Å“under the highest safety standards.Ã¢â‚¬Â It pledged to follow the Russian investigation into the disaster closely.  A Sukhoi Superjet crashed in Indonesia in 2012, killing all 45 people on board in an accident blamed on human error.  After SundayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accident in Moscow, an online petition was launched demanding that the Russian authorities ban the Superjet.

In a written reply to two Parliamentary questions, Mr Gan said investigations showed that the cases were not linked and there has not been any report of the drug-resistant fungus being spread locally.  Last month, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that there were 11 isolated cases in public hospitals.  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), referring to the emergence of viruses, bacteria and fungi which are resistant to standard drugs and treatments, is a ""global public health issue"", Mr Gan said.  ""While AMR can occur naturally in some microorganisms, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials such as antibiotics globally in healthcare, as well as the animal and agricultural sectors, have led to accelerated development of AMR.  ""Due to increased global connectivity, there is a growing risk of AMR being spread internationally. Singapore, being a global travel hub, is exposed to the importation of AMR organisms.""  Several measures have been put in place to address the development and spread of AMR in Singapore, Mr Gan said.  These include regulations on the prescription and sale of antibiotics to minimise the risk of misuse and overuse, as well as public education campaigns on the proper use of antibiotics, such as the Health Promotion Board's ""Use Antibiotics Right"" campaign last year.  In public hospitals, there are also antimicrobial stewardship programmes to guide doctors to use antimicrobial drugs appropriately, as well as infection prevention and control measures to reduce the risk of spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, Mr Gan added.  He was replying to Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar GRC) who asked whether the MOH would revise its measures to deal with superbugs like Candida auris and how preventative measures would be strengthened in hospitals and clinics here.  ALSO READ: Super fungus Candida auris: What you need to know about catching bugs in hospitals  Workers' Party Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera also asked what measures were being planned to ensure that public confidence in hospitals here remains high.  Mr Gan said: ""Notwithstanding these measures, we can expect infections with antimicrobial-resistant organisms to occur from time to time as microbes can naturally acquire AMR and antimicrobials still need to be used for treating infections.""  ""Healthcare institutions must therefore remain vigilant in surveillance and maintain high levels of infection prevention and control to prevent spread of AMR. MOH also works with healthcare institutions to monitor antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections.""  Enhanced measures in education, surveillance, research, infection prevention and control, and the optimisation of antimicrobial use are being progressively implemented under the national strategic action plan on AMR launched in 2017.  But he added that individuals also play a part in using antibiotics and antimicrobials prudently.  ""We encourage patients and consumers to consult doctors on the best course of medical treatments, take antimicrobials according to doctor's advice and only when indicated,"" he said.  ""Every one of us must also practise good personal hygiene to protect ourselves from infection.""  This article was first published in The Straits Times.

His offence was typing leaflets in Kurdish, banned under Syria's ruling Baath party.  Mohamad, with his family, fed and bathed his father for years. Wary of the typewriter that landed his father in interrogation rooms, he avoided learning to read his own language.  ""I never saw my dad walking,"" he said. ""Till his last day, he believed he would get up for this cause.""  Mohamad's father died in 2011, the year Syria's conflict began. He did not see Kurdish fighters carve out autonomous rule across north and east Syria. He did not see his son, now 34, become a teacher at a Kurdish school in the city of Qamishli on the border with Turkey.  Kurdish leaders now hold about a quarter of Syria, the biggest chunk outside state hands. But their grip on power - in a region rich in oil, farmland and water - remains vulnerable: President Bashar al-Assad wants all of Syria, Turkey threatens to crush them and US support is wavering.  The changes reshaping swathes of Syria have alarmed neighbouring states that fear separatism within their own Kurdish communities. Millions of Kurds, an ethnic minority left stateless when the Ottoman empire collapsed a century ago, live in Turkey, Iran, Syria and Iraq.  In Qamishli, these changes were once unimaginable. A law student who was tortured for carrying a Kurdish book now owns a bookstore. A woman who once secretly huddled with friends at night to learn Kurdish is now a de facto education minister.  Kurdish activists who could not protest without risking arrest now have printing presses, festivals and television channels.  The shift is glaring in school hallways where, for eight years, a generation has grown up not only learning Kurdish but also learning to believe that Kurds deserve the rights they were denied for decades and must hold on to them.  ""We never imagined this. This was a dream,"" said Ms Semira Haj Ali, who co-chairs the education board in the north-east. ""Of course, we will not go back to before 2011. We will not turn back.""  SANDBAGS AND TRENCHES  Syrian Kurdish leaders say they do not seek independence but want to cement autonomy that has evolved to include security forces and what amounts to a government.  Yet the sandbags and trenches around some schools or the armed men guarding printing presses show their fate still hangs in the balance.  On one side, there is the Turkish army, which has swept across the border twice to roll back the Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria.  On another, there is Mr Assad, now holding most of Syria with Russia and Iran's help. Damascus has pledged to reclaim YPG territory though the two have kept channels open.  Their main ally, the United States, helped Kurdish-led forces seize vast territory from Islamic State. But it opposes their autonomy plans and has promised nothing.  Related Story Between a Syrian rock and a Turkish hard place: Kurd autonomy under threat after ISIS 'caliphate' falls  President Donald Trump's plan last year to withdraw all US troops from Syria threw Kurdish officials into crisis.  Washington later changed course, and intends to leave some troops, along with forces from European allies, preserving for now the security umbrella that helped Kurdish leaders deepen their autonomy.  MOTHER TONGUE  In the early days of Syria's conflict, when Ms Ali and other activists tried introducing a Kurdish class, the government shut down the schools.  ""With the parents and the students, we broke down the doors,"" she said. Months later, state employees returned.  Today, she heads an education board running thousands of schools and universities, and teaching adults to read Kurdish. It has built a curriculum in Kurdish, Arabic and the Syriac dialect for pupils to learn in their mother tongue, renouncing the Baathist thinking that championed Arab nationalism in the classroom.  It teaches children until the 10th grade, up to age 16. In secondary schools however, inside the same buildings, state teachers still handle the 11th and 12th grade.  ""They succumbed to the reality,"" said Ms Ali, a member of the Kurdish PYD party, the YPG's political wing. Next year, her board will start teaching the 11th grade too.  The plans face opposition not just from the government but also from some Arab communities, Kurdish parties opposed to the PYD and parents who fear for their children's future, several teachers said.  The schools in north-east Syria, like the self-run administration, are not recognised officially by the state or the outside world.  In response to questions from Reuters, Syria's education ministry said it repeatedly tells all schools to keep the government curriculum for the benefit of the students and for degrees to remain valid abroad.  Some feel they have sacrificed too much to turn back now. Pre-school director Nujin Kali said her husband, a YPG fighter, had died so she could do her job.  ""Honestly, I asked him what if something happens to you?"" she recalled. ""He said, 'I'm doing this for your children's future... for them to learn their language, for people not to lose their rights'.""  BURNING BOOKS  Despite historic enmity, Kurdish fighters and Damascus have seldom clashed during Syria's war, at times fighting common enemies including Turkey-backed rebels.  This relationship enabled the state to hold onto patches of Qamishli, including an airport that flies planes to Damascus, and of Hasaka city nearby. It has also allowed for Kurdish leaders to make money from oil sold into government territory.  Funds also come from levies on trade, agriculture and border-crossing fees.  Residents register births, marriages and deaths at state centres in Qamishli and Hasaka, while the self-run administration issues driving licenses and other documents.  Senior Kurdish leader Fawza Youssef said such ties enabled people to get on with their daily lives.  Still, attempts to negotiate a political deal with Damascus have gone nowhere, causing fears for Kurdish authorities who want to safeguard their gains.  They hope such a deal would also help shield their region from attack by Turkey, which deems the YPG a branch of the Kurdish PKK movement waging an insurgency on Turkish soil.  In northern Syria, another source of tension is that local critics accuse the PYD of calling the shots and imposing its ideas even in city councils that include Arabs and other ethnicities.  At the institute that sets the curriculum in the town of Amuda, the walls bear pictures of jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. The northern region's new governing system is based on his views of federalism, though the PYD says it has only political relations with the PKK.  Teachers say the curriculum does not promote any ideology, but presents Ocalan's ideas along with others in classes such as ""culture and ethics"" or gender studies.  The questions of how to govern and what to teach have caused friction in mainly Arab cities and towns in Raqqa and Deir al-Zor that came into the Kurdish fold more recently.  Mr Abdallah Shekho's shop in Qamishli sells books he translated with friends into Kurdish. He said the north-east, whose economy was long stifled, still relies on Damascus in some ways because it lacks equipment and experts.

Symptoms in humans of monkeypox Ã¢â‚¬â€ which is endemic in parts of Central and Western Africa Ã¢â‚¬â€ include lesions, fever, muscle ache and chills.  Transmission is usually via close contact with infected animals such as rodents and monkeys and is limited between people. It has only been fatal in rare cases.  The man who brought in the virus arrived in Singapore on April 28, the city-state's health ministry (MOH) said in a statement late Thursday.  The 38-year-old developed symptoms two days later and is currently isolated at an infectious disease centre in a stable condition, the ministry said.  At least 23 individuals who had been in close contact with the man had been traced, and those who are in Singapore will be quarantined and monitored for 21 days as a precaution, MOH said.  One had already left Singapore on May 5 before the Nigerian was diagnosed at hospital but has since made contact with the city's health authorities and has reported he is well.  ""The risk of community spread of monkeypox in Singapore is low,"" said Leo Yee Sin, executive director of Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  He said that on average ""each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other person"", which makes the virus less infectious than the common flu.  Outside Africa, human monkeypox infections had only been previously reported in the United States, Britain and Israel, according to the US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.  Singapore, a tiny but affluent city-state dependent on external trade and tourism, has toughened measures against infectious diseases after it was hit hard by the 2003 Sars virus outbreak.

The operation was launched to free two French tourists who had disappeared while on holiday in the remote Pendjari National Park in neighbouring Benin on May 1.  Advertisement  But during the raid, the French troops were surprised to discover two women also in captivity, with top officials saying they had been held for 28 days.  The French tourists were identified as Patrick Picque, 51, and Laurent Lassimouillas, 46, but the women's identities were not immediately clear.  ""No one was aware of (the women's) presence,"" French Defence Minister Florence Parly told reporters, while French armed forces chief Francois Lecointre said.  ""We know little about these other two hostages,"" Parly told reporters, saying that even Seoul and Washington did not appear to be aware the pair were in increasingly unstable Burkina Faso.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Laurent Lassimouillas (L) and Patrick Picque are expected to travel back to France on Sunday. (Photo: AFP/STR)  The raid was approved by French President Emmanuel Macron in what was seen as the last opportunity to stop the hostages being transferred to lawless territory in Mali to the north.  Parly said it was ""too early to say"" who had snatched the two French nationals from Benin, which has long been an island of stability in a region where Islamist militants are increasingly active.  ""The message to terrorists and criminal gangs is clear: those who attack France and its nationals know that we will not spare any effort to track them down, find them and neutralise them,"" she said.  Four of the six kidnappers were killed in the raid.  French forces, helped by intelligence provided by the United States, had been tracking the kidnappers for several days as they travelled across the semi-desert terrain of eastern Burkina Faso from Benin to Mali.  They seized the opportunity to prevent ""the transfer of the hostages to another terrorist organisation in Mali,"" Lecointre said, referring to the Macina Liberation Front (FLM).  The FLM is a militant group formed in 2015 and headed by a radical Malian preacher, Amadou Koufa. It is aligned with Al-Qaeda in the region.  US INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT  In a statement, Macron congratulated the special forces on the operation, in which he also expressed sorrow over the death of the two soldiers ""who gave their lives to save those of our citizens"".  And Parly thanked authorities in Benin and Burkina Faso for their help with the ""complex operation"", as well as the United States which provided intelligence and support.  The operation was also made possible by the presence of France's Operation Barkhane, which counts some 4,500 troops deployed in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad to help local forces battle militant groups.  American special forces and drones are also known to operate in the violence-wracked Sahel region, which France fears could become further destabilised as militant groups are pushed out of north Africa, Iraq and Syria.  Burkina Faso has suffered from increasingly frequent and deadly attacks attributed to a number of militant groups, including the Ansarul Islam group, the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM) and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara.  RELIEF AND SADNESS  The French tourists - Patrick Picque who works in a Paris jewellery shop, and Laurent Lassimouillas a piano teacher, - went missing with their guide on the last leg of their holiday in usually peaceful Benin.  The Pendjari wildlife reserve, which is famed for its elephants and lions, lies close to the porous border with Burkina Faso.  The Pendjari wildlife reserve is known for its elephants and lions.

Washington thanked the French forces for freeing the American hostage, with France saying she would likely be ""repatriated independently"" from the other three.  The two dead French soldiers were named as Cedric de Pierrepont and Alain Bertoncello, decorated naval special forces members born in 1986 and 1991 respectively.

The group will redeploy its fighters from the ports of Hodeidah, Saleef and Ras Isa over four days, starting on Saturday, said the UN mission to support a peace deal brokered in Sweden last December.  In a statement, the mission's Redeployment Coordination Committee said the troop redeployment was ""a first practical step on the ground"" under the pact, which marked the first major breakthrough in peace efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.  The UN mission will monitor the redeployment, the statement said, adding that it must be followed by ""the committed, transparent and sustained actions of the parties to fully deliver on their obligations"".  The move should allow the UN to take ""a leading role in supporting the Red Sea Ports Corporation in managing the ports"" and to enhance UN checks on cargoes.  Al Jazeera's James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, cautioned it was ""too early to say"" whether Friday's announcement signalled an ""actual breakthrough"".  ""The Stockholm deal in December, brokered almost six months ago, said the Houthis should pull out and they haven't done it yet,"" Bays said.  ""If the Houthis don't do it this time, it could collapse the whole peace process,"" he added.  Aid lifeline  Under the agreement, pro-government forces are also expected to leave positions around the outskirts of Hodeidah in the initial redeployment, before a second phase in which both sides pull back further.  The UN statement, however, did not mention any reciprocal move by pro-government forces, who are backed by a Saudi-UAE-led military coalition.  Shortly after the announcement, Moammar al-Eryani, Yemen's information minister, said the offer of redeployment was ""inaccurate and misleading"".  In a post on Twitter, al-Eryani added that any withdrawal that did not allow for joint monitoring and verification was unacceptable.  The coalition alleges the Houthis use Hodeidah as a landing point to smuggle weapons supplied by Iran into Yemen, a charge the Houthis have denied.  Humanitarian officials have long pleaded with Yemen's warring sides to spare the port, which serves as the entry point for the bulk of Yemen's commercial imports and a lifeline for aid supplies.  The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country and home to an estimated 28 million people, began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by Houthi rebels, who toppled the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.  Concerned by the rise of the Houthis, believed to be backed by Iran, the Saudi-UAE-led military coalition launched an intervention in 2015 in the form of a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling Hadi's government.  The subsequent fighting and an ensuing economic collapse have unleashed the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis, pushing millions of people to the brink of starvation.",en,terrorattack,,

ISÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Amaq News Agency late on Friday announced the new province, that it called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wilayah of HindÃ¢â‚¬Â, in a statement that also claimed IS inflicted casualties on Indian army soldiers in the town of Amshipora in the Shopian district of Kashmir.  The IS statement corresponds with an Indian police statement on Friday that a militant called Ishfaq Ahmad Sofi was killed in an encounter in Shopian.  ISÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statement establishing the new province appears to be designed to bolster its standing after the group was driven from its self-styled Ã¢â‚¬Å“caliphateÃ¢â‚¬Â in Iraq and Syria in April, where at one point it controlled thousands of miles of territory.  IS has stepped up hit-and-run raids and suicide attacks, including taking responsibility for the Easter Sunday bombing in Sri Lanka that killed at least 253 people.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The establishment of a Ã¢â‚¬ËœprovinceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in a region where it has nothing resembling actual governance is absurd, but it should not be written off,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Intel Group that tracks Islamic extremists.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The world may roll its eyes at these developments, but to jihadists in these vulnerable regions, these are significant gestures to help lay the groundwork in rebuilding the map of the IS Ã¢â‚¬ËœcaliphateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Sofi had been involved in several militant groups in Kashmir for more than a decade before pledging allegiance to Islamic State, according to a military official on Saturday and an interview given by Sofi to a Srinagar-based magazine sympathetic to IS.  He was suspected of several grenade attacks on security forces in the region, police and military sources said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a clean operation and no collateral damage took place during the exchange of fire,Ã¢â‚¬Â a police spokesman said in the statement on FridayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encounter.  The military official said it was possible that Sofi had been the only militant left in Kashmir associated with IS.  Separatists have for decades fought an armed conflict against Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir. The majority of these groups want independence for Kashmir or to join IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arch-rival Pakistan. They have not, like Islamic State, sought to establish an empire across the Muslim world.  Nuclear powers India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, and came to the brink of a third earlier this year after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in the Indian-controlled portion of the region.  A spokesman for IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home ministry, which is responsible for security in Kashmir, did not respond to a request for comment.

The gunmen shot dead a security guard at the entrance to the five-star Pearl Continental Hotel before entering, the army said. It was the second deadly attack to take place in a prominent Pakistani city this week.  Advertisement  ""Security forces have cordoned area. Guests safely evacuated. Terrorists encircled by security forces in staircase leading to top floor. Clearance Operation in progress,"" a military spokesman said.  Earlier, Ziaullah Langu, the home minister for Balochistan province where Gwadar is located, told AFP four gunmen had ""opened fire"" on the hotel.  ""There are reports of a few people sustaining minor injuries,"" the minister said.  Mohammad Aslam, the on-duty officer in Gwadar, said ambulances and rescue officers were waiting at a road leading to the hotel, and that he could hear gunfire but that the operation was coming to an end.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""There were no Chinese or Pakistani guests in the hotel,"" he said, adding that only staff were present in the building, adding that at least three are believed to be injured.  A Baloch separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter.  The Pearl Continental, part of Pakistan's largest five-star hotel chain, is the only luxury hotel in Gwadar, frequented by foreign and Pakistani business delegations as well as diplomats.  It sits isolated on a ridge overlooking the Arabian Sea port city of Gwadar, formerly a small fishing village but now touted by officials as ""the next Dubai"" thanks to the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).  Part of China's Belt and Road initiative, CPEC seeks to connect the western Chinese province of Xinjiang with Gwadar, with the development of the port as the plan's flagship project.  Gwadar will provide China with safer and more direct access to the oil-rich Middle East than the waterway trade route it currently uses through the narrow Malacca Straits.  But it has also drawn its share of attacks, particularly from separatists who have long complained that residents of Pakistan's poorest and largest province do not receive a fair share of profits from its resources.  Balochistan has been rocked by separatist, Islamist and sectarian insurgencies for years (Photo: AFP/Banaras Khan)  ROCKED BY INSURGENCIES  The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) is one of a myriad of insurgent groups fighting in Balochistan, which has been rocked by separatist, Islamist and sectarian violence for years.  The BLA has targeted Chinese workers in Pakistan multiple times, including during a brazen daylight attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi which killed four people in November last year.  At the time, the BLA branded Beijing ""an oppressor"".  Balochistan is tightly guarded by the Pakistani military, who have been targeting insurgents there since 2004. The army has been repeatedly accused by international rights groups of abuses there, but denies the allegations.  Foreigners are rarely allowed to travel to the province without seeking special authorisation.  Violence in Pakistan has dropped significantly since the country's deadliest-ever militant attack, an assault on a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar in 2014 that killed more than 150 people - most of them children.  But militants still retain the ability to carry out attacks, including in major urban centres and tightly-guarded targets, and analysts have long warned that Pakistan is yet to tackle the root causes of extremism.  Earlier this week a suicide blast claimed by the Pakistani Taliban at one of the country's oldest and most popular Sufi shrines killed at least 12 people in the eastern city of Lahore.",en,terrorattack,698,['Pakistan']

Pork accounts for three-quarters of total meat consumption in Vietnam, a country of 95 million people. Most of its 30 million farm-raised pigs are consumed domestically.  The virus was first detected in Vietnam in February and has spread to 29 provinces, including Dong Nai, which supplies around 40 per cent of the pork consumed in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's southern economic hub.  ""The risk of the virus spreading further is very high and the evolution of the outbreak is complicated,"" the government said in a statement.  It said many provinces had failed to detect outbreaks and cull infected pigs properly due to a lack of funds and the space needed for burying the dead pigs.  The disease has also spread quickly across neighbouring China.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in March advised Vietnam to declare the swine fever outbreak a national emergency.  According to the Singapore Food Agency, Vietnam is not approved to export pork to Singapore. However, China is on the agency's list of approved pork exporting nations.  The virus, which is not communicable to humans, can be spread by live or dead pigs, domestic or wild, and via pork products. Symptoms in animals include high fever, weakness, skin lesions, diarrhea, vomiting and difficulty breathing. Death can occur within a week of infection.  There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, and the only way to stop it is to cull all affected or exposed swine herds. If that occurs, there will not be enough surplus pork in the world to make up for the anticipated shortfall in Chinese production.  Affected animals have now been reported in every province in China, and the disease has spread to neighbouring Mongolia and Cambodia.  At least 129 outbreaks have been reported since African swine fever was first identified in August, reducing the ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hog population by 40 million and leading to the extermination of an estimated 1 million hogs, according to ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National Bureau of Statistics.

This includes cases reported to the CDC as of Friday but does not include any cases identified or reported since then.  Some good news this week is that no new states reported cases, leaving the number unchanged at 23. The states that have reported measles cases this year are Arizona Tennessee and Washington  But still troubling: Sixty-six of the 75 new cases were in New York, according to a source familiar with the measles situation in the United States. Of those, 41 were reported by New York City, and 25 were reported by Rockland County. These areas are home to the Orthodox Jewish communities that have been reporting an increasing number of cases since October.  The outbreak there began when an unvaccinated child traveled to Israel and returned home with the highly contagious disease, New York City health officials have said. That child infected others, and the number of cases grew.  An infected person from New York visited Detroit and unknowingly spread the virus , which led to an outbreak in Michigan.  State health officials in Connecticut said one case there was a resident who had visited New York.  Seven months in, New York City and state health officials have failed to contain the outbreak, as indicated by the number of cases continuing to be reported.

An additional 498 cases as of Monday evening have been reported in New York City, according to health officials, 442 of which have been reported this year. In all, New York state has reported 606 cases of measles in 2019.  New York City and Rockland County have taken separate steps to contain the outbreak.  As of Monday, New York City health officials said that 98 summonses had been issued for violations by people who are ""non-compliant with the Emergency Order since the City began issuing summonses last week."" That includes those in the ZIP codes of the outbreak who remain unvaccinated and cannot provide proof of vaccination or measles illness.  ""Any person receiving the summons is entitled to a hearing, and if the hearing officer upholds the summons, a $1,000 penalty will be imposed. Failing to appear at the hearing or respond to the summons will result in a $2,000 fine,"" a statement from the health department said.  This week, a new awareness campaign is set to be released by the New York City health department, with ads on bus shelters, in publications and elsewhere targeting the communities in English and Yiddish.  Since October 1, health officials there say they've administered nearly 23,000 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine and that more than 11,000 of those doses were administered in Williamsburg, where 80% of the New York City cases have occurred.  According to the Rockland County Health Department , more than 20,000 doses of the MMR vaccine have been administered there since October.  The vaccine is 93% effective against measles after one dose and 97% effective after two doses.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine: the first dose for children when they are between 12 and 15 months old and the second when children are 4 to 6 years old.  Babies between 6 months and 12 months should be vaccinated before international travel or if they live in a community experiencing an outbreak. That dose may not offer lasting protection, so the other two doses should be administered as recommended for routine vaccination.  Babies who are traveling to or living in an area with an ongoing outbreak who have had a first dose at 12 months to 15 months do not need to wait until age 4 for that second dose; rather, they can and should get it anytime after 28 days from the first vaccination.  As for adults, the CDC recommends that those who were born during or after 1957 who do not have evidence of immunity against measles should get at least one dose of MMR. Those born before 1957 are assumed to have had measles and are therefore immune and don't need to be vaccinated.",en,diseas,,

A corrected version of the story is below:  Oregon vaccine bill dead as US measles count soars  A controversial bill to boost Oregon's vaccination rate is dead in the water as the national measles count continues to soar past levels not seen in decades  By SARAH ZIMMERMAN  SALEM, Ore. (AP) Ã¢â‚¬â€ Critics blasted a decision by Oregon lawmakers that killed a bill aimed at getting more children vaccinated for measles and other preventable diseases in order pass a tax on large businesses, saying it jeopardized public health.  Despite passing the House and having the necessary votes in the Senate, the measure to make it harder for families to opt out of required vaccinations was nixed as part of a deal announced Monday to end a week-long Republican walkout over a multibillion school funding tax.  Under the vaccination measure children would only have been be able to forgo vaccine requirements with a doctor's note, otherwise they'd be unable to attend public school.  Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, a Democrat from Beaverton, Oregon, and the bill's sponsor, said the move prevents the state from protecting its citizens from a public health crisis.  ""This isn't how I want our state to be known,"" she said. ""This is a major public health issue and it's critical we address it.""  More than 70 people, including four from Oregon, were diagnosed as part of a months-long outbreak in the Pacific Northwest that public health officials just recently declared over.  ""As the recent measles outbreak demonstrated, vaccine-preventable illnesses pose a growing threat due to the relatively low rate of immunizations in the Northwest,"" said Robb Cowie, a spokesman with the Oregon Health Authority, the state's health care agency.  Oregon has the highest rate of unvaccinated kindergartners in the country, with at least 7.5% of toddlers claiming an exemption. In some schools, more than 40% of children are unvaccinated through the state's lax exemption process. That makes Oregon uniquely susceptible to an outbreak, according to Diane Peterson associate director for Immunization Action Coalition, which receives funding from the CDC.  ""Oregon in particular is a hotbed for a measles outbreak,"" Peterson said. ""All you need is to introduce one person with the disease into the community and it will spread like wildfire.""  Oregon was one of a number of states proposing to crack down on non-medical exemptions, in response to a national resurgence of measles that has now sickened over 800 people this year according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.  The state is one of 17 to allow families to opt out of required school vaccinations for personal, philosophical or religious reasons.  Neighboring Washington state this year passed a law to end most exemptions for the measles vaccine, while Maine is working to remove its religious and personal exemptions for all vaccines. Some states, including Rhode Island, introduced measures to add exemptions.  The anti-vaccination movement surged in the 1990s, after a study alleged a link between the measles vaccine and the rise of autism. The study has since been discredited.  Mississippi, California and West Virginia are the only states that banned all non-medical exemptions. Mississippi has the highest childhood vaccination rate in the country, while the California law, passed in 2015, caused a significant boost in vaccination numbers.  Republican and Democratic leaders are remaining tight-lipped on why the vaccine issue in particular was targeted as part of the walkout deal.  Steiner Hayward said she wasn't involved in the negotiations and that she personally received a call from Gov. Kate Brown to tell her the vaccine bill would not move forward this session.  Senate Majority Leader Ginny Burdick, from Portland, stressed that the tradeoff was worth it to coax Republicans back to the Capitol and vote on a $1 billion annual boost in school funding. It wasn't, she said, a response to the vitriolic opposition the proposal has received from hundreds of parents opposed to vaccinating their children.  ""The people opposing that bill just behaved reprehensibly around the building,"" said Burdick at a news conference Monday. ""And one of the things that distresses me is I'm afraid that some of them are going to feel that those tactics worked. Those tactics had nothing to do with what happened.""  ___  Associated Press writer Jennifer McDermott contributed to this post from Providence, Rhode Island.  --  Follow Sarah Zimmerman on Twitter at @sarahzimm95",en,diseas,,
2921510,aljazeera,None,Sudan's military rulers suspend talks with protesters,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/sudanese-security-forces-open-fire-khartoum-sit-190515160917339.html,,16/5/2019 7:09,"Sudan's military rulers have suspended talks over the makeup of a sovereign council designed to steer the country towards democracy until demonstrators remove roadblocks put up in parts of the capital, Khartoum, protest leaders said.  Rashid Al-Sayid, a spokesman for the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group, told AFP news agency on Wednesday that the military had halted negotiations and asked demonstrators to ""dismantle the barricades and ""go back"" to a weeks-long sit-in being held outside the Sudanese army's headquarters in Khartoum.  Another protest leader, Ahmed al-Rabie, confirmed the ruling military council's condition for a resumption of negotiations with the protest movement.  The development came just hours after security forces opened fire at the the sit-in in a bid to clear demonstrators from the site, which has served as a focal point for demonstrators calling for Sudan's ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) to cede power to a civilian-led administration following the overthrow of longtime president Omar Al-Bashir last month.  At least eight people were wounded by the gunfire, a spokesman for the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group wrote on Facebook.  A protest leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP news agency three were in serious condition.  A witness said troops from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fired shots into the air as they moved to clear protesters from the area, which has served as a focal point for demonstrators calling for Sudan's ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) to cede power to a civilian-led administration following the overthrow of longtime president Omar Al-Bashir last month.  Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, reporting from Khartoum, said the violence broke out after RSF forces - whose head is also the deputy head of the military council - tried to ""remove barricades"" erected around the protest site but were met with resistance by demonstrators.  ""There is lots of tension in front of the army headquarters,"" she said, citing earlier violence at the site on Monday that led to at least four deaths.  Ongoing negotiations  The violence came after the TMC announced earlier on Wednesday that after two days of talks it had brokered a deal with the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF) alliance on the composition of a legislative council and a three-year transition period to a civilian administration.  190514200752119  Under the agreement, the opposition alliance would have two-thirds of the seats on a legislative council, TMC member Lieutenant-General Yasser al-Atta told reporters at a press conference.  However, the two sides are yet to agree on the make-up of a sovereign council, the envisaged top tier of power during the planned transition period, with both wanting majority representation.  Satea al-Hajj, a DFCF member, said: ""The viewpoints are close and, God willing, we will reach an agreement soon.""  Final negotiations were due to take place on Wednesday evening, but that now appears unlikely.  Violence in Khartoum  Amid the back-and-forth, protesters pushing for a civilian-led transition have remained in the streets, including outside the army headquarters where the sit-in started on April 6.  Some roads in the centre of the capital have been blocked with stones, bricks, branches and slabs of concrete that security and paramilitary forces have occasionally tried to remove.  190514233712368  On MondayÃ™Ë† after security forces opened fire while trying to clear some protest sites, an outburst of violence left at least four people dead, including three protesters and a military police officer. They were the first deaths linked to the protests for several weeks.  Al Jazeera's Morgan said the TMC denied responsibility for the violence.  ""The military council came out and said the people who fired at protesters were not part of their forces or from the RSF,"" she said, adding that the TMC said it would launch an independent investigation into the incident.  The United States blamed Sudan's military rulers for the deaths, however.  ""The tragic attacks on protesters ... were clearly the result of the Transitional Military Council trying to impose its will on the protesters by attempting to remove roadblocks,"" the US Embassy in Khartoum said in a statement on Facebook.  ""The decision for security forces to escalate the use of force, including the unnecessary use of tear gas, led directly to the unacceptable violence later in the day that the TMC was unable to control.""  Scores killed  Separately on Monday, Sudan's prosecutor general announced that al-Bashir had been charged ""with inciting and participating"" in the killing of protesters during the mass protests that led to the end of his decades-long rule.  190501175500137  There has been no comment from al-Bashir since his removal and arrest on April 11. The former president is reportedly being held at the maximum security Kobar prison in Khartoum.  Demonstrations against the 75-year-old were sparked by a government decision in December to slash bread and fuel subsidies but quickly escalated into wider calls for him to stand down.  Human Rights Watch, citing monitoring groups, said last month at least 70 protesters have been killed by government forces since the demonstrations began.  Last week, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, a group linked to the protest movement, put the death toll at more than 90.",en,terrorattack,,

The coalition carried out 11 attacks on the capital in all, out of a total of 19 across rebel-held territory on Thursday, the Houthi-run Masirah TV channel reported. It blamed ""aircraft of the [Saudi-led] aggression"".  The air strikes came two days after the Iran-aligned rebels claimed drone attacks that temporarily shut a key oil pipeline in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.  Rubble filled a populated street lined by mud-brick houses, a Reuters journalist on the scene said. A crowd of men lifted the body of a women, wrapped in a white shroud, into an ambulance.  Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya quoted a coalition statement as saying it launched an operation aimed at ""neutralising the ability of the Houthi militia to carry out acts of aggression"".  ""The sorties achieved its goals with full precision,"" it said, adding civilians had been warned to avoid those targets.  'Deliberate bombardment'  Masirah quoted the Houthi health ministry as saying six civilians, including four children, had been killed and 52 wounded, including two Russian women working in the health sector.  190514155502867  A witness told AFP news agency that raids began around 8am (05:00 GMT).  Afrah Nasser, a Yemeni journalist, said her family's home in Sanaa was near where one air strike hit. She accused the Saudi-UAE alliance of deliberately targeting civilians.  ""I know the street. There are no military targets there. There is no excuse from the Saudi-led coalition - it was a deliberate and systematic bombardment attacking civilians,"" Nasser told Al Jazeera.  Nasser Arrabyee, another Yemeni journalist, said the number of casualties was expected to rise.  ""Medical sources are saying that they have received a lot of victims - injured and dead - which means the number will be even higher than just six,"" he told Al Jazeera from Sanaa.  ""Residential areas in the middle of Sanaa, in the most crowded areas, were randomly bombed and many houses were reduced to the ground.""  Calls for retaliation  On Tuesday, the Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for twin drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's main East-West oil pipeline, saying they were a response to ""crimes"" committed by Riyadh during the bloody air war it has led in Yemen since March 2015.  Saudi Arabia's deputy defence minister accused Iran on Thursday of ordering the drone attacks on two Aramco pumping stations as a ""tool to implement its expansionist agenda in the region"".  ""The terrorist acts, ordered by the regime in Tehran, and carried out by the Houthis, are tightening the noose around the ongoing political efforts,"" Prince Khalid bin Salman said on Twitter.  The head of the Houthis' Supreme Revolutionary Committee denied that Iran directed the strike and said the movement manufactures its drones locally. Tehran also denies providing arms to the Houthis.  ""We are not agents for anyone,"" Mohammed Ali al-Houthi said. ""We make decisions independently and do not take orders for drones or anything else.""  Oil tensions  The Saudi pipeline, which can carry five million barrels of crude per day, provides a strategic alternative route for Saudi exports if the shipping lane from the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz is closed.  Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the vital conduit for global oil supplies in the case of a military confrontation with the United States.  The Saudi cabinet called on Wednesday for ""confronting terrorist entities which carry out such sabotage acts, including the Iran-backed Houthi militias in Yemen"".  Key ally the United Arab Emirates (UAE) echoed the call.  ""We will retaliate and we will retaliate hard when we see Houthis hitting civilian targets like what happened in Saudi Arabia,"" the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Wednesday.",en,terrorattack,706,['Sanaa']

The bodies of 11 soldiers who had previously been reported missing were discovered on Wednesday, security sources told AFP news agency.  ""We have confirmation that the dead bodies of the eleven missing soldiers have been found, bringing the death toll to 28,"" a source told AFP on Wednesday.  An army spokesman on Thursday confirmed the toll has risen to 28, Reuters news agency reported.  Later on Thursday, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack vie its propaganda media outlet, without providing evidence.  The attack on the military patrol took place near the town of Tongo Tongo, in the western Tillaberi region of Niger.  According to the local news website Actuniger, a patrol of 52 Nigerien soldiers came across a group of heavily armed men at Baley Beri, which resulted in a two-hour long fight.  It said that 22 soldiers returned to their base at Ouallam in three vehicles, citing local and security sources.  The attack took place in the same region where where fighters from an ISIS affiliate killed four US special troops and as many Nigerien soldiers in an ambush in October 2017.  Armed groups, including affiliates of al-Qaeda and ISIL, have stepped up attacks on military and civilian targets across West Africa's Sahel region this year.  The border areas, where Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali meet, are especially dangerous and violence is worsening across the region.  Attackers killed at least 10 in apparently sectarian attacks on churches in neighbouring Burkina Faso this week.  Niger also faces a threat in its southeast from Boko Haram and a splinter group affiliated with ISIL, which are both based in Nigeria but frequently carry out attacks in Niger, Chad and Cameroon.

On Saturday, thousands protested in central London to demand an end to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“unprecedented attacksÃ¢â‚¬Â against the Palestinian people at the hands of Israel, The Guardian reported.  NEARLY 65 PALESTINIANS INJURED IN PROTESTS ALONG GAZA-ISRAELI BORDER: OFFICIALS  Allegations of anti-Jewish prejudice within Labour have grown since Corbyn, a veteran socialist, was elected leader in 2015.  On Saturday, Corbyn posted his message Ã¢â‚¬Å“to those on the National Demonstration for Palestine in LondonÃ¢â‚¬Â writing on Facebook, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We cannot stand by or stay silent at the continuing denial of rights and justice to the Palestinian people.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Labour Party is united in condemning the ongoing human rights abuses by Israeli forces, including the shooting of hundreds of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators in Gaza - most of them refugees or families of refugees - demanding their rights,Ã¢â‚¬Â Corbyn said.  He then referenced the violence near the Israel-Gaza border earlier this month where 25 Palestinians, and four Israelis were killed when Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired more than 600 rockets into southern Israel in less than 24 hours, and Israel retaliated with dozens of airstrikes against militant sites in Gaza.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The silence of many governments, including our own, has been deafening. The UK government should instead unequivocally condemn the killing of demonstrators Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including children, paramedics and journalists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and other civilians, and freeze arms sales to Israel,Ã¢â‚¬Â Corbyn said.

Their fate is one of the core issues of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel rejects demands for a mass return of refugees to long-lost homes, saying it would threaten the country's Jewish character.

An Iraqi military spokesman told reporters the rocket appeared to have been fired from east Baghdad, which is home to several Iran-backed Shiite militias.  Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have risen in recent weeks after the Trump administration ordered warships and bombers to the Middle East earlier this month to counter threatened attacks against U.S. interests by Iran or Iranian-backed forces.

On Wednesday, it ordered the evacuation of non-essential personnel from the US embassy in Baghdad embassy and the Erbil consulate in northern Iraq, citing ""imminent"" threats from Iranian-backed Iraqi armed groups. It did not disclose any details, and its account has been met with widespread scepticism outside the US.  But in recent days, the White House has sent mixed signals over its stance against Iran, amid multiple US media reports of infighting in Trump's cabinet.  John Bolton, Trump's long-hawkish national security adviser, is reportedly pushing a hard line on Iran, but others in the administration are resisting. Trump himself said recently that he has to ""temper"" Bolton.  And when he was asked on Thursday if Washington was going to war with Tehran, Trump replied, ""I hope not"". That comment came a day after he expressed a desire for dialogue, tweeting: ""I'm sure that Iran will want to talk soon.""  ""It really is becoming a clear that this administration is sending mixed messages when it comes to Iran,"" Al Jazeera's Patty Culhane, reporting from Washington, DC, said.  ""So the big question is why did he send that confrontational tweet? Is it because he received some sort of classified briefing or is it because of something he watched on television? We don't know.""  'Contradictory and schizophrenic'  Trita Parsi, a professor of Middle East politics at Georgetown University, described TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s threat as  ""extremely dangerous"".  ""This is genocidal,"" he told Al Jazeera from Reston, Virginia. ""This is absolutely not something that any leader of a country should do, but it is also somewhat contradictory and schizophrenic,"" he added.  ""If we were to try and make sense of it, if there actually is a logic behind all of this, then my guess would be that earlier on Trump was led to believe - probably by people like [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu] and Bolton that Iran is an easy target, that they are about to crumble and that if you just ratchet things up the Iranians are going to back off,"" continued Parsi.  ""Then the intelligence came which showed that as the Iranians were starting to perceive an American threat they were making themselves ready to retaliate and to defend themselves. And it appears as if that actually spooked Trump, because he did suddenly realise that actually an attack on Iran would lead to a larger war and he is clever enough to understand that a larger war is not in his interest, and ... he started saying things like he doesn't want to have a war.  ""But every once in a while his impulses get the better of him and that's when he goes on Twitter and says things that are just fundamentally genocidal.""  'There will not be a war'  Iran-US relations hit a new low last year as US Trump pulled out of a multinational 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed unilateral sanctions that had been lifted in exchange for Tehran scaling back its nuclear programme.  Last month, Washington also designated Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a ""terrorist"" entity. Tehran responded by declaring US Centcom a ""terror"" organisation.  190519055552084  On Saturday, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, downplayed the prospect of a new war in the region, saying Tehran opposed it and no party was under the ""illusion"" the Islamic Republic could be confronted.    ""We are certain ... there will not be a war since neither we want a war nor does anyone have the illusion they can confront Iran in the region,"" Zarif told state-run news agency IRNA at the end of a visit to China.  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Sunday the kingdom wanted to avert war in the region but stood ready to respond with ""all strength and determination"" after last week's attacks on the Saudi oil assets.  Saudi Arabia has accused its regional rival, Iran, of ordering Tuesday's drone attacks on two oil-pumping stations in the kingdom, claimed by Yemen's Houthi group.  The attack came two days after four vessels, including two Saudi oil tankers, were ""sabotaged"" off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE has not blamed anyone, pending an investigation, and Iran has denied any involvement.  ""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not want a war in the region nor does it seek that,"" al-Jubeir told a news conference on Sunday.  ""It will do what it can to prevent this war and at the same time it reaffirms that in the event the other side chooses war, the kingdom will respond with all force and determination, and it will defend itself and its interests.  ""We want peace and stability in the region but we will not sit on our hands in light of the continuing Iranian attack,"" al-Jubeir said. ""The ball is in Iran's court and it is up to Iran to determine what its fate will be.""  A senior Iranian military commander was similarly quoted as saying his country is not looking for war, in comments published in Iranian media on Sunday.  ""We are not pursuing war but we are also not afraid of war,"" Major General Hossein Salami was cited as saying by the semi-official news agency Tasnim.  The remarks came as Saudi Arabia's King Salman invited Gulf and Arab leaders to convene emergency summits in Mecca on May 30.  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed regional developments, including efforts to strengthen security and stability, in a phone call with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the Saudi Media Ministry tweeted on Sunday.",en,terrorattack,711,['US']

A rudimentary device containing nails and pieces of metal detonated on the perimeter of the Grand Egyptian Museum near a bus carrying 25 South African tourists from the airport to the pyramids district.  Advertisement  The Interior Ministry did not say whether the suspected militants were connected to Sunday's attack, but said its forces killed the suspects during raids on their hideouts in the 6th of October and Al Shorouk districts, where it said members of the militant group Hasm were planning a series of attacks in the country to create an ""atmosphere of chaos.""  Egypt accuses the group, which emerged in 2016 and has claimed several attacks, of being a wing of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt's oldest movement denies this and says it seeks change through peaceful means only.  The ministry said the suspects were killed in gunbattles, but did not elaborate on the suspectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ identity or whether there had been any casualties or injuries among the security forces.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Weapons and explosives were found at the scene of the shootouts, the ministry said.  A Reuters investigation in April found that Egyptian security forces had shot dead hundreds of suspected militants in what the Interior Ministry said were gunbattles, but which bereaved families said were extrajudicial executions.  A Reuters analysis of the ministry statements showed that deadly shootouts often followed an attack by militants. For example, in December 2018, a day after the deadly bombing of a Vietnamese tourist bus in Giza, the ministry announced that its forces had killed 40 people in three separate incidents.  Human rights organizations have accused Egypt of carrying out extrajudicial executions and of trying civilians in military courts as part of the crackdown.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said that the matter of human rights should be treated in the context of regional turbulence and the struggle against terrorism. Strong security measures, he has said, are needed to stabilise Egypt after the turmoil that followed the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2011 uprising.  EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in 2018, focussing on the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya.

The United States is in the midst of containing the largest number of measles cases in 25 years. Measles, a vaccine-preventable disease, was eliminated from the US in 2000, but the spread of online misinformation about vaccines has led to a public health crisis that has resulted in more than 800 cases in at least 20 states.  Vaccine sceptics represent only a tiny minority of the population, but their digital advocacy has evolved into the ""anti-vaccine"" movement - a well-organised online network with significant offline implications for public health and politics. These groups promote medically inaccurate information about vaccines and their viral content has dominated US's most powerful online platforms, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and YouTube.  Ill-equipped to respond to the social media savvy anti-vax movement, the US medical community must now confront both the contagion of online misinformation and the real-world viral spread of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Seven children were among those killed in the attacks that took place in Helmand's Gereshk and Kunar's Chawki districts on Monday and Wednesday, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a statement.  The statement said civilian casualties from air raids continue to rise while calling for the parties to ""respect international obligations to protect civilians from harm"".  190518084342224  UNAMA did not disclose information on who conducted the air raids.

Public Health England said even one person missing their vaccinations was ""too many"".  There were 795 cases of mumps in the first three months of 2019, compared with 1,031 in the whole of 2018.  Most mumps cases are linked to teenagers mixing when they go to university.  A large outbreak was centred on Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham at the beginning of the year and similar increases in cases have been reported in Wales and Northern Ireland.  The disease is caused by a virus that infects and causes painful swellings in the parotid glands under the ears.  In rarer cases, it can lead to viral meningitis and swollen ovaries or testicles.  Mumps is one of the infections the MMR vaccine protects against or at least lessens the symptoms of.  However, many of the students now at university were born at the peak of the MMR-autism scare around the turn of the century, when vaccination rates dropped.  The autism link, made by disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield, has since been completely disproved.  ""If you're going to university, now's the time to catch up if you missed out as a child,"" said Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at Public Health England.  Image copyright Getty Images  Public Health England has also reported outbreaks of measles in London, the North West and the East of England.  In the first quarter of 2019, there were 231 confirmed cases.  The World Health Organization says we are in the middle of a global measles crisis.  Cases in the UK are largely within communities with low-vaccination rates and are linked to travel to other countries with outbreaks.  Dr Ramsay added: ""Measles can kill and it is incredibly easy to catch, especially if you are not vaccinated.  ""Even one child missing their vaccine is one too many - if you are in any doubt about your child's vaccination status, ask your GP as it's never too late to get protected.""  Helen Bedford, professor of child public health at UCL, said: ""Measles is a highly infectious, potentially serious disease and England has not escaped the recent increase in cases we have seen globally.

Anwar R. worked for Syria's intelligence services until he defected at the end of 2012. He fled to Turkey and then moved to Europe, joining the ranks of the exiled Syrian opposition. Eventually, however, his history caught up with him.  Anwar R. was arrested in Berlin in February, suspected of crimes against humanity, including the torture of prisoners. He is the first current or former senior Syrian officer to be arrested in connection with the Assad regime's brutal suppression of protests at the start of the country's March 2011 uprising.  He was detained along with another Syrian, identified by German prosecutors as Eyad A., who worked for the regime's intelligence service and is also suspected of involvement in torturing prisoners. Both men face charges in German courts; multiple attempts to reach their lawyers for comment were unsuccessful.  CIJA Director Chris Engels says that as Syria's war winds down, the pursuit of justice against Assad's regime has become more 'urgent.'  A third Syrian was arrested in France on suspicion of crimes against humanity.  The arrests come eight years after the 2011 protests spiraled into a nation-wide bloodbath. Today, the guns on most of Syria's frontlines have fallen silent. Yet these arrests may signal a new phase in this conflict and they are considered the first big catch for the Syrian war's dedicated investigators.  Sometimes known as the ""document hunters,"" these Syrians have been recruited and trained by former war crimes investigators and lawyers to smuggle hundreds of thousands of government documents out of war zones. Often sprinting past explosions and sniper fire to bring the papers to safety, they risk their lives to help hold the perpetrators of war crimes accountable.  The 'document hunters'  ""I said goodbye to my wife and children and told them I am no longer yours. I am owned by Syria, by justice,"" said one investigator who asked to be identified as Adel.  A well-built middle-aged man, Adel is a self-described idealist. A commercial lawyer before the uprising, he has dedicated the last seven years of his life to the pursuit of justice.  ""If you think about the work you've done which you would like written on your tombstone, then for me, this is it,"" Adel said.  ""It is an extremely dangerous task because we are not armed,"" he added. ""And you have to preserve (the evidence) like you would protect a baby.""

Hide Caption 52 of 52  Since 2012, the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) has sought to ensure that evidence of alleged war crimes in Syria is compiled and preserved for future trials.  A non-profit organization funded by Western governments, CIJA has acquired over 800,000 Syrian intelligence and security documents. Over the last four years, it has used these papers to build cases against senior and former officials implicated in some of the regime's most brutal human rights abuses.  The Syrian government did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity, insisting that they target terrorists and not peaceful protesters.  Onslaught of bombs and bullets  Investigators like Adel have developed a kind of smuggling playbook. Typically, they hold near the frontlines as a battle rages, waiting for the Syrian military to withdraw from an area, leaving it in rebel hands.  The document hunters would then move into abandoned regime facilities and collect every document that they are able to salvage, retrieving every single paper in order to avoid accusations of selectivity in evidence collection.  But the regime nearly always intensifies its bombardment of areas just after its military retreats. The document hunter must then brave this onslaught of bombs and bullets, attempting to save documents that may otherwise be destroyed by fire or floods.  Several of these smugglers have been detained by warring parties during this process, according to Adel.  Over the last two years, the regime has recaptured most of Syria, making the collection of documents much harder. Yet the evidence still continues to trickle in.  'What we don't get out today ... might be lost forever'  CNN gained rare access to the latest handover of documents near one of Syria's borders.  In November, Adel's team arrived at a secret meeting point in the border region, carrying black garbage bags that concealed the documents. In a few swift movements, Chris Engels, CIJA's Director of Investigations and Operations, shoved the papers into suitcases in the trunk of his car and then took them to a nearby hotel.  ""In the past, when the regime was on its backfoot we were able to collect three or four times as much as that in one go,"" said Engels. ""With the Syrian regime taking more and more territory this work becomes much more urgent. We know that what we don't get out today or tomorrow might be lost forever.""  This trove of documents is kept in CIJA's secret headquarters in Europe where a team of analysts is translating and logging them. The documents are stored in stacks of boxes in a darkened and heavily air-conditioned room known as ""the vault.""  Documents taken from Syria's battle zones are stored in an air conditioned 'vault' in a secret European location.  The victims  The cases against suspected war criminals are not solely based on documents, however. They also rely on witness testimony and visual evidence, such as the so-called Caesar photographs . This collection of more than 28,000 images smuggled out by a military defector codenamed Caesar showed emaciated and wounded dead bodies of detainees in regime prisons.  Each corpse had a number on it which CIJA said its investigators were able to match with the data in their smuggled documents. This research helped the organization identify the dead and connect the bodies to individuals who oversaw the detainees' movements.  Stories of the torture and death of peaceful protesters in Syrian regime custody are widespread. Some 82,000 people are believed to have been forcibly disappeared into an abyss of prisons and military intelligence centers over the course of the war, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights in 2018.  Many former regime prisoners are reluctant to speak out now that Assad has all but declared victory. But for Amina al-Khoulani -- a former detainee and activist who has lost three brothers to regime prisons -- silence is not an option.  While there are no 'smoking guns,' the documents help paint a picture of a brutal crackdown on dissidents ordered from high levels of command.  ""They detained me and my husband in front of my mother and children,"" Khoulani told CNN. A soldier cocked his gun at her mother after they charged in ""like monsters,"" she said. Her frightened 4-year-old daughter, clinging to her mother's leg, wet herself.  During Khoulani's interrogations, she said her husband was brought into the room wearing only his underwear. She was made to watch her interrogators beat him and cover him with cold water, before she signed a forced confession.  ""I knew men were being tortured to death, and my husband looked horrible after three days of torture,"" recalled Khoulani.  After Khoulani's husband was released from prison, the family fled to the UK where they now live with their three children.  For years, she tried to track down news of her brothers Majd and Abdul Sattar al-Khoulani, who were detained in summer 2011, and Mohammed, who was imprisoned in 2012. After paying a number of bribes, she was able to visit Majd and Abdul Sattar in the notorious Saydnaya prison north of Damascus, dubbed by Amnesty International as a ""human slaughterhouse.""  Khoulani barely recognized her siblings, describing Abdul Sattar as a ""walking skeleton."" That was the last time she saw her brothers.  In 2015, the image of Mohammed's tortured and lifeless corpse was found among the Caesar photographs. Then, last summer, Amina received the government death notices of Majd and Abdul Sattar. The regime claimed both brothers had died of natural causes, although reports of extreme torture and neglect in regime prisons were well-documented and widespread. According to their death notices, they died at the same hour of the same day, 22:00 on January 15, 2013.  ""The (Syrian) regime is the Hitler of our time,"" said Khoulani. ""Bashar al-Assad will be tried. I might not be alive but my children may see that day.""  The search for justice  One of the senior regime members targeted by CIJA was Anwar R. Documents showed that the divisions that he ran detained and interrogated opposition activists on a nearly daily basis. Some 6,000 pages of documents smuggled to CIJA detail the workings of his departments, notorious for its torture chambers according to several human rights groups.  One of the security branches he worked at -- Branch 285 -- is headquartered in a five-story building in Damascus with an underground section of 250 solitary confinement cells. Beatings, sexual abuse and electrocution were widely reported to be rampant in these quarters.  The cases built against high-ranking officers, CIJA says, reveal a systematic drive against protests, and marks a significant step towards bringing the Assad regime to justice for crimes it has long been accused of.  ""There are very few smoking guns,"" said Engels. Instead, the documents reveal an organizational structure that clarifies how orders went up and down the bureaucracy.  ""Through an understanding of that chain of command we can then tie leadership to the events that happened on the ground,"" he said.  ""Peace is a very important thing if you can stop the killings,"" Engels added. ""But that doesn't mean that justice might not come later ... when the discussion about justice does appear in five or 10 or 20 years, there will be evidence there.""  After receiving the crushing news about her brothers last year, Khoulani resolved to stop campaigning against Assad. But her silence was short-lived. She now sees making her voice heard as key to keeping alive the memory both of her brothers and the true history of Syria's war.  ""The regime's voice is getting louder,"" said Khoulani. ""If we are silent maybe the version of truth will be distorted. The truth will be buried with us so we need to continue speaking up.""",en,terrorattack,,
2963249,bbci,None,Sudan crisis: Military calls for snap election amid protests,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-48503408,,4/6/2019 12:58,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sudan military attacks protesters  Sudan's military leaders say they are scrapping all existing agreements with the main opposition coalition and will hold elections within nine months.  The announcement came as the military faced mounting international condemnation for their violent attack on protesters in the capital, Khartoum, which reportedly left at least 30 dead.  The US said it was a ""brutal attack"".  The crackdown came after the military and protesters agreed a three-year transition period to civilian rule.  The Transitional Military Council (TMC), which has governed Sudan since President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in a coup in April, and negotiators for the pro-democracy movement had also settled on the structure of a new administration.  But the TMC's head, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said in a statement broadcast on state television that they had decided to ""stop negotiating with the Alliance for Freedom and Change and cancel what had been agreed on"".  An election in nine months time would take place under ""regional and international supervision"", he added.  The announcement came after leaders of the pro-democracy movement, who demand that a civilian government take over the running of the country, said they were stopping all contact with the TMC and called a general strike.  What happened at the protest sites?  The security services moved on the main protest site early on Monday, activists said, and heavy gunfire could be heard in video footage.  The demonstrators have been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters since 6 April, five days before Mr Bashir was overthrown.  In a statement read on national television, the military council expressed its ""sorrow for the way events escalated"", saying the operation had targeted ""trouble makers and petty criminals"" .  ""During the execution of the campaign, large numbers of these groups took shelter in the sit-in square, which led some of the square's officers, based on their judgment, to follow and chase them, which led to losses and injuries.""  The military, the statement added, was dedicated to protecting civilians.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Protesters set ablaze tyres to try to stop Sudan's security forces  Earlier, activists said the security forces had surrounded one hospital in Khartoum and had opened fire at another.  The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is close to the protesters, said 30 people - including an eight-year-old child - had been killed, and that the toll was likely to rise as not all casualties had been accounted for.  Hundreds of people had been injured, it added.  Some residents blame the notorious paramilitary unit known as the Rapid Support Forces, set up to help keep Mr Bashir in power and with roots in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan, which began in 2003.  Then known as the ""janjaweed"", this militia carried out frequent massacres.  The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which is spearheading nationwide protests, called for a campaign of ""sweeping civil disobedience to topple the treacherous and killer military council"".  What has the reaction been?  The UN secretary general urged the Sudanese authorities to facilitate an independent investigation and to hold those responsible accountable.  UN Secretary General AntÃƒÂ³nio Guterres called for an independent investigation saying he was ""alarmed"" by reports that officers had opened fire in a hospital.  ""He condemns the use of force to disperse the protesters at the sit-in site and he is alarmed by reports that security forces have opened fire inside medical facilities,"" a statement for Mr Guterres said.  In other reaction:  UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said this was ""an outrageous step that will only lead to more polarisation and violence"" and that the military council ""bears full responsibility""  Tibor Nagy, US assistant secretary of state for Africa, said: ""This was a brutal and coordinated attack, led by the Rapid Support Forces militia, that mirrors some of the worst offenses of the Bashir regime""  The African Union called for an immediate and transparent investigation  A closed-door meeting at the UN Security Council was due to be held on Tuesday at the request of the UK and Germany  Sudan's state news agency said the public prosecutor had set up a committee to investigate the violence.  'People power' takes big hit  Analysis by Tomi Oladipo, BBC's Africa security correspondent  It is back to square one for Sudan's political process. The hardening stances that stalled the talks between the protest groups and the TMC have been further cemented on both sides.  Expect more resolute protests and a possibly even more ruthless crackdown from the men in uniform. It is the latter who are governing right now. What matters is which faction of the security forces has the upper hand in the TMC.  The hardliners, particularly the Rapid Support Forces - led by the deputy head of the regime, Mohamed ""Hemeti"" Hamdan Dagalo - appear to be leading the way and could display more ruthlessness than has been seen so far.  There has been a total lockdown in Khartoum, indicating something has shifted within the regime. ""People power"" is taking a big hit, but protesters could be willing to take greater risks to force the military's hand, if possible.

The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, a medical group linked to protesters, said at least 13 people were killed and several wounded in the Monday morning raid, which was still in progress. The committee also said security forces used live ammunition inside East Nile Hospital in Khartoum where some of the wounded were being treated.  In a post on Twitter, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) said the country's ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) had assigned a large number of troops to disperse the protest camp.  The sound of heavy gunfire was heard in footage broadcast from the scene, while plumes of smoke were seen rising into the sky.  Mohammed Alamin, a journalist in Khartoum, told Al Jazeera troops from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) first used tear gas then sound grenades to disperse protesters. Soldiers then fired live rounds at the remaining protesters.  ""They are now in control of most of the sit-in area and have burnt down the makeshift clinics. Most of the protesters have been dispersed. Soldiers are blocking all entrances to the area with military vehicles to stop protesters from returning,"" Alamin said.

""We are being attacked by the Rapid Support Forces and the police,"" Mamadou Abozeid, a protester in Khartoum, told Al Jazeera over the phone.  'Shooting at everyone'  Mohammed Elmunir, another protester in the Sudanese capital, said security forces blocked the exits of the sit-in site before opening fire on protesters.  ""They were shooting at everyone randomly and people were running for their lives. They blocked all roads and most tents at the sit-in have been set on fire,"" Elmunir told Al Jazeera.  ""People are very angry right now. They don't know what could happen next. Protesters have dispersed to other parts of the city. They are now on the streets protesting. Most people have blocked the roads in their neighbourhoods,"" he added.  In a statement, the SPA said the TMC would be held accountable for any bloodshed and called for a campaign of civil disobedience.  ""It is imperative to go out to the streets to protect the revolution and the remaining dignity. Our weapons are peace courage,"" it said in a statement.  ""We call on the revolutionaries in all neighbourhoods, villages, towns and cities of Sudan to go out to the streets and start marching, closing all streets and bridges and ports. We call for a comprehensive civil disobedience to bring down the deadly military junta and complete our revolution.""  Nawal Osman, a protester in Khartoum, said she and her husband were getting ready to leave their house and join the protesters.  ""I am going there now, I live near the protest area,"" she told Al Jazeera over the phone. ""This revolution is staying,"" she added. ""We are all ready to be there, to protect the country and to get rid of those criminals.""  Sudanese human rights activist Azaz Elshami said it was not surprising the military had resorted to using deadly force to deal with protesters.  ""What is happening is the mask is finally falling. The military is not different from the government before it. They are not what they said they are. They don't want change and they want power for themselves. Now, everyone knows what they are up against. This is a new phase. It might take much longer, but I don't think Sudanese people will back down,"" Elshami told Al Jazeera.  'Barbaric act'  The sit-in has become the focal point of Sudan's protest movement, which saw longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir overthrown in April and has since been calling for the generals who replaced him to hand over power to a civilian-led administration.  The operation came days after Sudan's military rulers called the sit-in outside the defence ministry ""a danger"" to the country's national security and warned that action would be taken against what they called ""unruly elements"".  190527072135511  The military also ordered the office of the Al Jazeera Media Network in Khartoum to be shut down, without giving any reason.  It withdrew the work permits for the correspondents and staff of the Qatar-based news organisation.  ""People have started putting up barricades in many areas and it seems that the situation is aggravating,"" Hamid Eldood, a professor at Al-Neelain University, told Al Jazeera from Khartoum.  He added that the latest developments indicated a ""tone change"" by the members of the TMC following the visit by its head, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo - also known as Hemeti - ""to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates"".

Dozens of participants in the so-called People's Peace Movement walk set out last week from Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital of southwestern Helmand province, headed for Musa Qala, a Taliban stronghold more than 100km away.  The activists, whose march started during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, have called for peace in Afghanistan, which has been beset by war for nearly two decades, and a ceasefire over the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which started on Tuesday.  Mullah Haibatullah Akhunzada, the Taliban's leader, rejected pleas for a cessation of hostilities, however.  Two supporters of the peace movement told AFP news agency on Tuesday that Taliban fighters detained about 25 marchers the day before, sparing only a few older members.  The move came after the armed group forced four walkers to accompany them in vehicles on Sunday as they crossed into Taliban territory in the south of the country, said Abdul Malik Hamdard, a peace march supporter.  ""Initially [the Taliban] told us that 'we will talk to them' ... [but] we have had no news from them since then,"" Hamdard said.  Bacha Khan Mawladad, another member of the peace march, confirmed to the dpa news agency that four people were taken by the armed group on Sunday for ""discussions"".  The Taliban on Tuesday released photos of the four marchers, including its leader Iqbal Khyber, and said the men were safe and would not be harmed.  The armed group previously accused the People's Peace Movement, which attracted international attention during a march across Afghanistan last year, of being financed by the central government in Kabul, an allegation the activists denied.  Years of bloodshed  The Taliban launched an rebellion in Afghanistan shortly after it was dislodged from power in 2001 following a US-led invasion.  A series of diplomatic talks held between US and Taliban negotiators have yet to produce any peace deal, despite both sides suggesting some progress had been made. The two sides are at loggerheads over the timeline for a withdrawal of foreign troops in Afghanistan, among other things.  190601093359747  About 17,000 foreign troops, including some 14,000 US soldiers, are based in Afghanistan as part of a US-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces. Some US forces also carry out ""counterterrorism"" operations.  Washington has said it will not agree to any withdrawal of troops until the Taliban put in place security guarantees, implement a ceasefire, and sign off on other commitments including an ""intra-Afghan"" dialogue with the US-backed Kabul government.  But the Taliban insists it will not do any of these until the US announces a withdrawal timeline. It refuses to negotiate with Kabul, calling the Afghan government a ""puppet"" of the West.  Amid the back-and-forth, attacks in Afghanistan continue unabated with civilians often bearing the brunt of the bloodshed.  According to the United Nations, almost 4,000 civilians - including more than 900 children - were killed in the country last year, with more than 7,000 others wounded. It was the deadliest year on record.

Some sat on the floor with their wounds bandaged, as others with gunshot injuries lay waiting for help from doctors who had been working round the clock for more than a day.  Outside the hospital in central Khartoum, more than a dozen military trucks carrying armed soldiers lined the street. They were from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the same faction that launched the raid that killed more than 35 people on Monday.  A medic, who identified himself as Nazar, said the soldiers had surrounded the hospital early on Tuesday morning. Shortly after noon, they ordered the hospital staff to evacuate all wounded protesters within an hour.  ""One of their seniors came into the hospital and told the administration to evacuate the hospital of patients,"" Nazar said. The soldier ""said they don't want the patients here. Some have left, the only ones remaining are those inwards"", he said.  Sources at the hospital told Al Jazeera the soldiers also arrested one of the doctors, identified as Waleed Abdullah, after shooting him in the leg. The doctor was part of the medical team at the weeks-long sit-in, which was cleared out at dawn on Monday. Witnesses at the raid said troops also shot and beat doctors and medics working at medical tents at the protest site.  ""They used whips and sticks to beat the doctors,"" a medic who witnessed the attack said. Requesting anonymity for fear of reprisal, she said the beatings were so severe that some of the doctors and medics had to be taken to hospitals for treatment.  ""One of our colleagues had his arm broken when the RSF beat him,"" she said.  'It's either you or the nation'  In addition to the 35 people who were killed during the raid on Monday, more than 200 were wounded, according to a doctor's committee aligned to the protest movement. Many were still missing on Tuesday and feared dead, the group said.  The attack, which protest leaders described as a ""massacre"", came nearly two months after the Sudanese military toppled President Omar al-Bashir following months of protests against his nearly 30 years of rule. A 10-member Transitional Military Council (TMC) took power and promised elections within two years, but protesters continued their sit-in, demanding a civilian-led transition to democracy.  Sudanese protesters burn tyres and set up barricades on roads to army headquarters after a deadly crackdown on Monday [Mahmoud Hjaj/Anadolu]  The two sides began negotiations, but tensions mounted as talks stalled over the composition of a new transitional authority. Monday's violence, which drew global condemnation, did not come as a surprise to the protesters.  Hours before the attack, the Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA), which has led the anti-government protests since December, issued a statement urging more people to join the sit-in. It also called on medics to prepare for an emergency. Some who answered the call marched to the sit-in calling on protesters to prepare to die.  ""It's either you or the nation. Prepare your Kafan"", they chanted, referring to the white sheet used in Muslim burial rites.  Protesters said they had anticipated that a large number of people would deter such an attack, but those hopes were misplaced. Live videos of the raid, streamed online, showed soldiers using live ammunition as they advanced on the protesters.  A demonstrator who used to guard the makeshift barricades leading to the sit-in said he saw large numbers of soldiers being bussed in before the attack.  ""They first drove in with their military pick-ups and blocked the entrance to the headquarters of the air and naval forces,"" he told Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity. ""Then other pick-ups with men dressed in police uniforms but were clearly RSF drove in.""  The shooting started shortly after 5am local time. The witness said the soldiers opened fire on people in the reflective vests worn by protesters guarding the barricades. The troops beat protesters and forced them to dismantle barricades to allow the military trucks through, he added.  'Unjustified and unlawful'  The ensuing attack was recorded by fleeing protesters.  ""They're killing us!"" one protester was heard in a video as sounds of gunshots cackled in the background. ""People, those forces are killing us!""  190604104903001  In other videos, verified by Al Jazeera, protesters can be seen shouting for help while still others bleeding on the ground as they took their last breaths.  ""The RSF were shooting at the protesters and so we ran for cover,"" said Fawaz, who gave only one name.  ""Some of them jumped off their pickups and headed towards the sit-in area, shooting at people, and beating those who ran to escape them. We ran, helping one of those injured by a bullet.""  Fawaz, who was also a guard at the barricades, said the soldiers shot at people who tried to help wounded protesters.  ""When we tried to help our injured colleague jump over a wall with us, the RSF started shooting,"" he recalled.

Medics linked to the opposition said the death toll from MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operation and subsequent unrest had risen to 108 and that it was expected to increase. State news agency SUNA early on Thursday put the number much lower, at 46, citing a health ministry official.  The raid, which followed weeks of wrangling between the ruling military council and opposition groups over who should lead SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transition to democracy, marked the worst outbreak of violence since the army ousted President Omar al-Bashir in April after months of protests against his 30-year rule.  The Transitional Military Council cancelled all agreements it had reached with the opposition immediately after the raid, but it rowed back on Wednesday amid mounting international criticism of the violence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We in the military council extend our hand for negotiations without shackles except the interests of the homeland,Ã¢â‚¬Â its head, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said on state TV.  But a Sudanese alliance of protesters and opposition groups rejected the offer, saying the military could not be trusted.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Today the council invited us to dialogue and at the same time it is imposing fear on citizens in the streets,Ã¢â‚¬Â Madani Abbas Madani, a leader of the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF), told Reuters.  Madani said BurhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invitation had come before the arrest of one of the opposition alliance members, Yasir Arman, deputy head of the Sudan PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) rebel group.  GUNFIRE, STREET BLOCKADES  Opposition medics said 40 bodies that had been pulled out of the Nile on Tuesday were among the 108 killed. The bodies were taken to an unknown destination by pickup trucks belonging to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the medics said. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report.  A military council spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment, but the council said on Twitter that some Rapid Support Forces members had been attacked and that people had put on their uniforms to impersonate them in an attempt to harm their reputation.  The mood in the capital, Khartoum, remained tense on Wednesday, with demonstrators blocking streets in several districts. Gunfire rang out in the distance.  Sudanese protesters gesture and chant slogans at a barricade along a street, demanding that the country's Transitional Military Council hand over power to civilians, in Khartoum, Sudan June 5, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer  Most shops were shuttered on what would usually have been a bustling Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday. Minor protests erupted outside mosques after Eid prayers, but there were no reports of significant clashes with security forces.  The deputy head of the military council, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti, said in a televised speech that it had launched Ã¢â‚¬Å“an urgent and transparent investigationÃ¢â‚¬Â into the recent violence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Any person who crossed boundaries has to be punished,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  The military has denied trying to clear the sit-in protest outside the defence ministry on Monday. Its spokesman said forces moved in to deal with disruptive groups nearby and the violence spread from there.  Saudi Arabia, which has close ties to SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military council, said on Wednesday it was watching developments with great concern and called for more dialogue.  U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said in a Twitter post that MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violence by SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security forces was Ã¢â‚¬Å“abhorrentÃ¢â‚¬Â and demanded that the military council facilitate moves towards a civilian-led government.

A Sudanese protester holds a national flag as he stands on a barricade along a street, demanding that the country's Transitional Military Council hand over power to civilians, in Khartoum, Sudan June 5, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer  Ethiopia meanwhile will launch a mediation effort on Friday, diplomatic sources in Khartoum said.  The moves take place after security forces cleared protesters from a sit-in camp in central Khartoum on Monday, killing dozens of people in the worst violence since President Omar al-Bashir was removed by the military in April after four months of generally peaceful protests.  The opposition had been in talks with an interim military council over a civilian-led transition to democracy, but the negotiations faltered and this weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crackdown marked a turning point in the power struggle.  The United Nations and several foreign governments have condemned the bloodshed.  The African UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Peace and Security Council, in a meeting in Addis Ababa on Thursday, decided to suspend Sudan from all AU activities until a civilian government has been formed. Suspension is the African UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s normal response to any interruption of constitutional rule in one of its members.  Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was due to visit Khartoum on Friday to try to mediate between the military and an opposition alliance, a diplomatic source at the Ethiopian embassy in Khartoum said.  The source told Reuters that Abiy would meet members of the Transitional Military Council and the oppositionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces during his one-day visit.  Ethiopia hosts the headquarters of the African Union but it was not clear if Abiy would be acting under AU auspices.  DISPUTED TOLL  The Sudanese Health Ministry said on Thursday that 61 people had been killed in the crackdown but the opposition put the toll at 108.  The action was led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) parmilitary force, witnesses said. Troops fired on unarmed protesters then mounted a wider operation crackdown in the following days, they said.  The RSF, commanded by the military councilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deputy leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, was built up from militias that fought insurgents in SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s western Darfur region during a civil war that began in 2003.  The militias are accused of involvement of widespread atrocities in Darfur, and Bashir was indicted in 2009 and 2010 by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and genocide - charges he denies. He is now detained in Khartoum.  Amnesty International called for international action against the military rulers and condemned the RPF for its role in the violence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The RSF, the special military force which killed, raped and tortured thousands in Darfur, brings its murderous rampage to the capital,Ã¢â‚¬Â Amnesty said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reports that bodies have been dumped in the river demonstrate the utter depravity of these so-called security forces.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The military council has denied the force was involved in any illegal actions and said it was facing a negative media campaign Ã¢â‚¬Å“from hostile partiesÃ¢â‚¬Â. The raid was targeting criminals in an area adjacent to the camp, it said.  Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti, said the military council had launched an investigation into the violence and would punish anyone found guilt of abuses.  CYCLE OF IMPUNITY  The deployment of the RSF suggests that Dagalo, a former Darfur fighter with a fearsome reputation, is calling the shots, at least when it comes to security. He is close to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and has committed Sudanese troops to the military coalition they lead in YemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s civil war.  Amnesty said that SudanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent history has been defined by impunity for war crimes and other human rights violations.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are urging the African Union Peace and Security Council and the UN Security Council to break this cycle of impunity and take immediate action to hold the perpetrators of this violence accountable,Ã¢â‚¬Â the London-based rights humans group said.  Meanwhile, movement began to return to the Sudanese capital on Thursday after some fraught days. Following the raid on the camp, protesters had blocked roads with rocks and burning byres.  Security forces led by RSF units have been trying to open roadblocks. Witnesses said traffic was now flowing again on main roads in Khartoum but many shops remained closed.  Sudan has been rocked by unrest since December, when anger over rising bread prices and cash shortages broke into protests against Bashir that culminated in the military removing him, ending his three decades in office during which the country became a pariah state in Western eyes.  In the wake of MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s events, the military council canceled all agreements reached with the opposition on a democratic transition and announced plans to hold elections within nine months. Protesters rejected the plan.  Additonal reporting by Dawit Endeshaw in Addis Ababa, Writing by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Angus MacSwan",en,terrorattack,717,"['Union', 'Sudan', 'Sudan']"

Public Health England (PHE) said the victims were among six patients affected in England and the deaths occurred in Manchester and Liverpool.  Two of the victims were at Manchester Royal Infirmary, with the other a patient at Aintree Hospital.  Sandwiches and salads from The Good Food Chain linked to the outbreak have been withdrawn and production stopped.  PHE said the products were withdrawn from hospitals when the links to the infections were first identified.  A spokesperson for the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""deepest condolences to the bereaved families"" and ""sincerely regret"" that two of their seriously ill patients contracted listeria.  The trust, which would not say when the deaths happened, said the sandwiches were from the patient menu.  The first patient showed symptoms on 25 April while the most recent case was reported on 15 May, a PHE spokeswoman said.  Aintree Hospital said: ""Public health experts advised us of this supply chain issue on Friday 24 May and we immediately removed all products from this supplier.""  Image copyright Google Image caption A patient at Aintree Hospital also died  Dr Nick Phin, deputy director at the National Infection Service at PHE said: ""To date, there have been no associated cases identified outside healthcare organisations, and any risk to the public is low.""  PHE said The Good Food Chain - which supplied 43 NHS trusts across the UK - had been supplied with meat produced by North Country Cooked Meats which subsequently produced a positive test result for the outbreak strain of listeria.  This business and North Country Quality Foods, which it distributes through, have also voluntarily ceased production.  A spokesman for The Good Food Chain Ltd said the company's production facility in Stone, Staffordshire, was ""cross contaminated by an ingredient from one of its approved meat suppliers"".  The BBC has contacted North Country Quality Foods for comment.  What is listeria?  Listeria is a bacterium which can cause a type of food poisoning called listeriosis.  Normally, the symptoms are mild - a high temperature, chills, feeling sick - and go away on their own after a few days.  But these cases occurred in people who were seriously ill.  Along with pregnant women, newborn babies and the elderly, they are most at risk of a more serious infection that can spread to the brain or bloodstream.  In 2017 there were 33 deaths linked to listeriosis in England and Wales.  Listeria can be found in many types of food such as soft cheeses, chilled ready-to-eat foods like pre-packed salads, sandwiches and sliced meats, and unpasteurised milk products.  To reduce the risk, the NHS advises people keep chilled food in the fridge, heat food until it is piping hot and not eat food after its use-by date.",en,diseas,,

North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said on Wednesday nationwide preventive measures are being carried out to contain the virus, quoting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as saying""prevention is the key to production in livestock industry"".  ""Increasing livestock production goes hand in hand with raising farm animals safe from various diseases,"" said Kim according to the newspaper.

Test results for the 23-year-old are expected later on Thursday, he said, adding that a total of 27 contacts are now being monitored.  Uganda has banned public gatherings in the Kasese district where the patients are being treated, Ainebyona said.

The infections in Uganda confirmed that the deadly outbreak has spread for the first time beyond the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Uganda, which has been on high alert for a possible spread of Ebola and has already vaccinated many frontline health workers, is relatively well prepared to contain the virus.

The WHO has said it will reconvene an emergency committee on Friday to decide whether the outbreak is an international public health emergency and how to manage it.

GENEVA: The World Health Organization emergency committee will decide Friday whether to declare a raging Ebola epidemic an international threat, after an outbreak that began in Democratic Republic of Congo crossed into Uganda.  The WHO panel, which was formed in 2005, has used the label ""public health emergency of international concern"" for only four previous epidemics.  Those emergencies included the H1N1, or swine flu, pandemic of 2009, the spread of poliovirus in 2014, the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016 and the surge of the Zika virus in 2016.  The current Ebola crisis, which began in eastern DRC in August, has recorded more than 2,000 cases, two-thirds of them deadly.  The WHO panel, officially known as the International Health Regulations and Emergency Committee, has met twice already on the current DRC outbreak.  It held off making the emergency call at previous meetings in October and April, in part because the virus had not spread internationally.  Uganda cases confirmed  That changed this week with confirmation that Ebola had reached western Uganda, where it has claimed two lives so far.  A Congolese woman -- who is married to a Ugandan -- as well as her mother, three children and their nanny had travelled to DRC to care for her ill father, who later died of Ebola.  The WHO said 12 members of the family who attended the burial in Congo were placed in isolation in the DRC, but six ""escaped and crossed over to Uganda"" on June 9.  The next day, a five-year-old was admitted to hospital in Bwera, a border town, vomiting blood before he died. Tests confirmed he had Ebola and the family was placed in an isolation ward.  His three-year-old brother was also confirmed to have Ebola, as was their grandmother, who died late Wednesday.  The mere fact that cases have crossed a border does not automatically compel the WHO panel to make the emergency declaration, especially as the epidemic is still confined to one contiguous region.  But invoking the emergency provisions will entail additional measures to manage the outbreak, including a possible call for ""immediate international action"", according to the UN health agency.  Restive region  Health officials had initially hoped that a new vaccine would help contain the outbreak.  But chronic violence and militia activity in the affected eastern DRC provinces of Ituri and North Kivu as well as hostility to medical teams among some people in the region have hampered the response.  Some of the latest violence has hit the Ituri's Djugu territory, where clashes have killed at least 50 people since Friday, a regional official said.  The cause of the flareup was not immediately clear, but it occurred in a region where tens of thousands died in clashes between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups between 1999 and 2003.  Undetected  Meanwhile, new research from Cambridge University released on Thursday indicates that half of all Ebola outbreaks have gone undetected since the virus was discovered in 1976.  The research, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, argues that more efforts are needed to identify early-stage Ebola outbreaks.  ""The unfolding epidemic in the DRC demonstrates how difficult it is to stop the disease once it has got out of control, even with international intervention,"" Emma Glennon from CambridgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s department of veterinary medicine said in a statement.  burs/bs/nl/gd",en,diseas,,

Following a complaint by the Doha-based media network, Twitter's management on Friday removed al-Matrafi's posts which violated the social network's rules and policies.  According to its policies, Twitter does not tolerate violent posts that threaten the lives of innocent people, and any account promoting incitement will be immediately and permanently suspended. Al-Matrafi's account has not been suspended.  In a series of tweets published on Thursday, al-Matrafi wrote: ""The Arab coalition has the right, in accordance with international law, not only to target the rocket launchers that targeted Abha airport, but also to strike those who gave the order, financial backing, and media support to them.""  Al-Matrafi was referring to an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on Saudi Arabia's Abha airport on Wednesday, which wounded 26 people. The Houthis have been engaged in a war with a Saudi-UAE-led coalition since March 2015.  ""This means that the Al Jazeera channel in Qatar could be a legitimate target for the coalition for supporting such a terrorist act,"" al-Matrafi wrote, who is known for his controversial Twitter posts, wrote.  Khalid al-Mutrafi tweeted that Al Jazeera is a legitimate target for Saudi-UAE coalition [Screengrab]  In another tweet, al-Matrafi reiterated his call for the targeting of Al Jazeera.  ""International law has given the coalition the ability to respond to the targeting of Abha airport on several fronts, and this does not only concern the Houthi group,"" he wrote.  ""There is a wide range of objectives that the international conventions and laws of war have allowed the coalition to strike. Al Jazeera in Qatar is a legitimate and logical target.""  Al-Matrafi joined the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya channel in 2009, and served as the director of the channel's office in Saudi Arabia until 2015.  He currently writes for local newspapers and is known as the ""Royal Diwan journalist"" for his proximity to influential officials in Saudi Arabia.  Previous threats against Al Jazeera  There have been previous calls to target Al Jazeera, including an article published on the Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat by Saudi journalist Abdulrahman al-Rashed.  In his article, al-Rashed, a former general manager Al Arabiya TV, warned that by extension, Qatar could face the same treatment similar to what the Egyptian protesters in Rabaa Square in 2013 suffered.  Back then, Egyptian security forces killed hundreds of protesters who had gathered to oppose the military coup against then-President Mohamed Morsi.  By the same token, a senior security official in the United Arab Emirates had called for the bombing of Al Jazeera in November 2017.  Dhahi Khalfan, the deputy chief of Dubai police, tweeted that the Arab coalition should bomb what he called Al Jazeera as a ""propaganda machine for terrorism Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the channel for the Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and al-Nusra Front.""  Furthermore, leaked documents from Wikileaks also revealed that the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, had asked the Americans to bomb the Al Jazeera Channel during the US war on Afghanistan.  Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of the Arab quartet that has blockaded Qatar since June 2017.

On Monday morning, a family was heading from the Democratic Republic of Congo back home to Uganda, after a funeral. The grandfather had died from Ebola and his daughter had gone to the country a few weeks earlier, to try and nurse him back to health.  By the time the family got near the Ugandan border, most of them were suffering from high fever and diarrhoea. They stopped in a health clinic and were put in isolation, awaiting tests. But after dark, six members of the family, including a five-year-old boy, slipped out of the clinic and set off down a desolate and poorly policed road crossing into Uganda. A few days later both the boy and his grandmother had died.  Health officials have long feared that this outbreak of Ebola virus could pass over the porous border into Uganda. The border is over 500 miles long and many of the crossings are informal - sometimes just a couple of planks laid across a shallow river. An endless stream of traders, some balancing baskets of eggs on their heads or swinging chickens by their feet, moves back and forth across the border each day.  The Ebola outbreak in five graphics  One of the main reasons it has been so difficult to contain the disease in DR Congo itself is because it is spreading in a conflict zone. Some 120 armed groups hide in the jungle-matted hills in the east of the country and regularly spring out of the bush to abduct or rape civilians. They make money smuggling minerals like gold and coltan, used in mobile phone batteries, or by plundering villages and stealing livestock.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Burying the dead in Butembo  Complicating things further, the local population has little trust in the authorities and their ability to respond. Health workers often move around with armed escorts, which arouses suspicion. And when impoverished villagers see fleets of four-by-fours tearing down their roads they talk about ""Ebola business"" and are jealous of the money being poured into the response.

People there told me they believe the disease was bought to the region on purpose so that foreigners could make money from them.  Since the start of the outbreak, there have been over 100 attacks on health workers and Ebola treatment centres. Some have been spontaneous, fuelled by distrust and jealousy. Others, like the burning down of treatment centres, were premeditated and organised by rebel groups. Their aim and agenda is unknown.  Image copyright Olivia Acland Image caption A burned treatment centre in Katwa, near Butembo  While I was in Butembo, I visited an Ebola treatment centre and spoke to a patient from the other side of a plastic window. She told me that she was there, hooked up to a drip, when rebels attacked but was too weak to flee. She said that she'd heard them shouting ""Get the matches!"" and had then felt heat from the blaze. She lay there thinking she would die until a nurse, who had fled, came back to rescue her some 40 minutes later. Luckily the tents where patients stay were spared and most of the centre has since been salvaged.  At the moment one in four Ebola sufferers in DR Congo are not turning up at treatment centres. In part, this is down to distrust and in part, fear - both of the disease and rebel attacks.  Image copyright Olivia Acland Image caption Health workers in DR Congo in protective clothing  DR Congo may be struggling to manage the spread of disease, but when the dreaded announcement came that the virus had spread across the border, Uganda was quick to act - 4,700 health workers in 165 hospitals have already been vaccinated. Marketplaces near the border have been closed down. Religious gatherings have been suspended. People are making an effort not to touch one another and handshakes have morphed into elbow nudges or waves.  Image copyright Olivia Acland Image caption Sterilised boots are put out to dry in the sun  In reality, it tends to take more than a sweaty handshake for the disease to spread. An Ebola patient can only pass on the virus if their fluids enter someone else's body through broken skin, their mouth, nose, eyes or other orifices. As the disease causes diarrhoea as well as making you sweat, bleed and vomit, those most at risk - by far - are the ones caring for the sick.  In Uganda, the battle against Ebola will be determined by the government's ability to win the confidence of the people. The country is not strife-torn like its volatile neighbour, and has a more robust health system. For the time being, at least, there is hope the disease will be contained in Uganda.

The oil-rich nation is now divided, with a UN-recognised but weak administration in the capital Tripoli overseeing the country's west and a rival government in the east aligned with the self-declared Libyan National Army led by renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar.  Libyan MP and former foreign minister Aly Abuzaakouk and Haftar lived in exile in the US ""for many years together as acquaintances, as friends ... in Fairfax"", and also knew Gaddafi during his school days. They'd both ""suffered from the ruthless regime"" of Gaddafi.  But after Hafter went back to Libya and ""started to build his own entourage"", Abuzaakouk ""realised this is not a person I would continue to have a relationship with ... He is a man who believes he is worthy of controlling Libya and he always would speak about the need for a strong force to control Libya.""  In April, Haftar launched a military offensive against the government in Tripoli and vowed to fight until Tripoli 'militias' were defeated.  But according to Abuzaakouk, Haftar's ""base of support in the east is not as it used to be"". In an interview with Al Jazeera, he said that opposition to Haftar has grown after the assault on Tripoli, with tribes now openly opposing him and ""calling for reconciliation with the rest of the country"".  ""Many forces have come together ... to support Tripoli, and the militia in Tripoli also defended their city ... They stopped the forces of Haftar and now they are hitting them back,"" he added.  But while support for Haftar might be waning inside Libya, he still has strong backers outside the country, says Abuzaakouk.  ""The former president of Tunisia spoke about the axis of evil. Abu Dhabi, the Saudis and the Egyptians ... This axis of evil has a mandate to work against the success of the Arab Spring,"" he said.  ""I think the international community have to realise they have supported Haftar with weapons against the United Nations Security Council resolutions. Everybody knows ... that there are arms coming from Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ at least Abu Dhabi and Egypt to Mr Haftar.""  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently appealed to all countries to enforce the arms embargo against Libya saying the issue is ""of immediate importance in de-escalating the current situation"" and ""of critical importance to the protection of civilians and the restoration of security and stability in Libya and the region"".  As Libya's ongoing crisis is still being deliberated in the international community, Abuzaakouk believes that the world at large failed the once wealthy African nation. ""Getting rid of Gaddafi was step number one. Building Libya to really restructure itself was step number two and the world community at large left Libya alone and that, I think, was a great mistake.""  ""Life in Benghazi and in Derna is unbearable, it's worse than the days of Gaddafi. There's no freedom of speech, there's no freedom of law, there are a lot of killings, extrajudicial killings ... I'm very clear that the war crimes committed by Haftar or others should be investigated,"" said Abuzaakouk.  ""There are now forces in Washington, in The Hague to really follow up on the war crimes that have been committed in Libya Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the Libyans deserve to have some of the criminals be brought to justice.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Source: Al Jazeera News",en,terrorattack,,

FILE PHOTO: Foreign Minister of Turkey Mevlut Cavusoglu in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, May 29, 2019. REUTERS/Waleed Ali/File Photo  The ministry said its forces immediately retaliated with heavy weapons and it made representations to Moscow over the incident, the second attack of its kind within a week.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is impossible for us to tolerate the regimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harassment targeting our soldiers. We will put them in their place,Ã¢â‚¬Â Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a televised speech in the southern Turkish province of Hatay, bordering Syria.  The ministry did not specify when the shelling occurred, but said the attack was launched from what it named the Tall Bazan area and it was assessed to be deliberate.  Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s civil war, and Turkey, long a backer of rebels, co-sponsored a de-escalation agreement for the area that has been in place since last year.  But the deal has faltered in recent months, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee. Idlib is the last remaining bastion for anti-government rebels after eight years of civil war.  Cavusoglu said the latest Ã¢â‚¬Å“aggressionÃ¢â‚¬Â was contrary to the Idlib agreement which Turkey signed with Russia.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is the responsibility of Iran and Russia, with which we have worked in close cooperation on Syria, to halt the regime,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  On Thursday Russia and Syria gave sharply conflicting accounts of a previous attack on a different Turkish outpost. [nL8N23K1T0]  Turkey blamed Syrian government forces for that earlier attack but Moscow said it was carried out by AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rebel enemies. Russia said on Wednesday that a full ceasefire had been put in place in the area, but Turkey denied this.  The latest incidents highlighted the erosion of the de-escalation deal, agreed last year to shield Idlib from a government assault.  The region is home to hundreds of thousands of people who fled other parts of Syria as government forces advanced through the country since Moscow joined the war on the side of Assad in 2015, tipping the conflict in his favour.  Since April, government forces have increased their shelling and bombing of the area, killing scores of people.  The rebels say the government action is part of a campaign for an assault that would breach the de-escalation agreement. The government and its Russian allies say the action is in response to rebel violations, including the presence of fighters in a demilitarised zone.

3051035,cnn,Analysis Tim Lister Cnn,The polarizing legacy of Mohamed Morsy,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/world/mohamed-morsy-a-polarizing-legacy/index.html,17/6/2019 0:00,18/6/2019 17:49,"(CNN) Mohamed Morsy represented both the zenith of the Arab Spring and its almost universal failure. He became Egypt's first democratically-elected president in 2012, but after a year of deepening chaos was forced from office in a coup led by then-defense minister Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi.  Al-Sisi's government kept Morsy in jail from the moment he was overthrown on July 3, 2013. Human rights groups warned that his poor health (he had diabetes as well as liver and kidney ailments) and his prolonged solitary confinement would lead to his premature death. His son Abdullah told CNN Monday that ""He was denied visits. The family was able to see him only three times since 2013.""  Last year, a group of visiting British parliamentarians said his ""inadequate care"" would likely cause a ""rapid deterioration of his long-term conditions, which is likely to lead to premature death.""  Amnesty International reacted to Morsy's death by saying: ""The Egyptian authorities have a proven track record of holding prisoners in solitary confinement for long periods and in harsh conditions.""  By some estimates, some 60,000 Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters are being held in Egyptian jails. Human rights groups have documented dozens of cases of torture.  A political earthquake  As the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Morsy won 51.7% of the vote in the elections that followed President Hosni Mubarak's ousting. His victory was an earthquake in the Arab World, where the Brotherhood had been an underground movement for decades - both feared and repressed by autocratic leaders.  Historian Fawaz Gerges wrote in his ""Making the Arab World"" that with Morsy's election ""in one stroke the Islamist organization went from being proscribed to being in charge.""  Morsy's victory was lauded by Islamists and sympathizers of the Brotherhood, especially in Qatar and Turkey. But the conservative Gulf states -- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates especially -- saw him as a threat. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia repeatedly warned Qatar against supporting the Muslim Brotherhood across the Arab world -- both before and after Morsy's election.  That schism, given potency by the Arab Spring, has endured ever since. When Morsy was overthrown, King Abdullah said the Kingdom ""stood and still stands today with our brothers in Egypt against terrorism, extremism and sedition."" Financial support for the Sisi government flowed from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  Nawaf Obaid, author of the forthcoming ""The Failure of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Arab World,"" says that ""one of King Abdullah's most enduring legacies will be the decisive role he played to stop and roll back the Muslim Brotherhood's grand design to take over most of the Arab world after the Tunisian revolution sparked the so-called Arab Spring.""  A brief tenure  In power, Morsy's only achievement of note was to broker a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel after eight days of violence in Gaza that had claimed more than 150 lives.  But many of Morsy's supporters quickly lost faith in him -- as his administration lurched from one crisis to the next. He wasn't even the Brotherhood's first choice as their presidential candidate. Gerges says he was a ""political pygmy, with limited intelligence and charisma, along with a penchant for making overblown promises and pronouncements.""  Unable to gain control over Egypt's judiciary and its extensive security apparatus, Morsy granted himself sweeping powers by decree, prompting those who had led the protests against Mubarak to accuse him of carrying out a coup against legitimacy and the rule of law. They feared that the real intent of Morsy and the Brotherhood was to create an Islamic State.  Egypt descended into political paralysis, compounded by a worsening economic crisis. Protests against Morsy swept through Cairo, just like the unrest that had broken Mubarak's long rule and ushered in Egypt's brief flirtation with democracy. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders misread the genuine popular unrest as part of a conspiracy by their enemies.  A 'terrorist organization'  After the 2013 coup, Morsy was charged with leaking state secrets to Qatar, ordering supporters to attack protesters during a sit-in outside the presidential palace and spying for Hamas. His convictions -- and lengthy prison sentences - meant he stood little chance of being released so long as Al-Sisi remained in charge.  Al-Sisi's government has conducted a remorseless campaign against the Brotherhood, which it declared a terrorist organization in 2013. That campaign began with the deaths of hundreds of Brotherhood supporters six weeks after Morsy was deposed, when police descended on a protest camp in a Cairo suburb.  Once again the group has been forced deep underground. Many of those able to escape sought sanctuary in Turkey.  But the world has moved on. The Obama Administration made some half-hearted criticisms of Morsy's ouster; the Trump Administration has embraced al-Sisi. President Trump welcomed him to the White House for a second time in April, calling him a 'great person.'  'We are very much behind President al-Sisi,"" Trump said.  To the US, Egypt is an important part of the front against Iran, just as it was during Mubarak's tenure.  Russia has also cultivated a close relationship with al-Sisi.  ""Just look,"" President Vladimir Putin said in 2014: ""There are problems in Afghanistan; Iraq is falling apart; Libya is falling apart. If General al-Sisi had not taken control in Egypt, Egypt would probably be in turmoil now as well.""  In death as in his brief spell in the political limelight, Morsy remains a polarizing figure. In Istanbul, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that ""History will not forget the tyrants who imprisoned him, threatened him with death and made him a martyr.""  Some of Morsy's younger supporters have been radicalized by the outlawing of the Brotherhood and have turned to violence, carrying out armed attacks against the military and police. But they are an irritant rather than a threat to a government that has seized every lever of power.  And yet the Muslim Brotherhood is far from extinct, despite the mass arrests and arbitrary killings. In a recent report the Carnegie Middle East Center wrote that ""Because Turkey, Qatar, and London are centers of the Muslim Brotherhood's administration, the exiled leadership is out of reach of the Egyptian authorities.""  The Brotherhood is also used to repression and has a unique structure for surviving. As the Carnegie report concluded, ""Egypt's political destiny will continue to be defined by the clash between the regime and Islamists.""",en,terrorattack,,

A soldier and two suspected rebels were killed in the latest shootout in the Anantnag area of India-administered Kashmir, army spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia said in a statement.

The remote-control bomb was set off in the same district as where a suicide bomber in February targetted an Indian convoy and killed 40 paramilitaries.  The attack led to India and Pakistan staging tit-for-tat air raids.  India and Pakistan divided Muslim-majority Kashmir after their independence in 1947, but both claim it in whole. An insurgency on the Indian side over the past three decades has left more than 70,000 dead, mainly civilians.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Kalia called the car bomb ""a failed attempt"" to hit an Indian patrol, but gave no other details.  However, a senior police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said that at least 12 soldiers were wounded in the blast and taken to a military hospital in Kashmir's main city, Srinagar.  Hours before the car bombing, a clash between suspected rebels and Indian forces left one soldier and one militant dead, according to Kalia.  Southern Kashmir has seen intense fighting over the past three years between Indian forces and rebels, who are demanding independence for the Himalayan region or a merger with Pakistan.  More then 100 rebels have been killed in Indian Kashmir this year in clashes with soldiers.  India has about 500,000 troops in its side of Kashmir, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly said they have a ""free hand"" to eradicate militants in the restive territory.  But the Kashmir public has also taken a more radical stance, with local residents increasingly trying to help besieged militants escape military cordons.

The attacks on Monday evening on the villages of Yoro and Gangafani 2 compound a dire security situation in central Mali, where ethnic militias regularly slaughter civilians from rival groups and Islamist militants are also active.  The victims of MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raids were mostly ethnic Dogons, said Issiaka Ganame, the mayor of Yoro, where 24 people were killed. Another 17 died in Gangafani 2.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“About 100 unidentified armed men circulating on motos all of a sudden invaded Yoro and fired on the population,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ganame told Reuters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Then they descended on the village of Gangafani 2, which is about 15 km (9 miles) away.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The tit-for-tat violence in recent months has largely pitted Dogon hunters against Fulani herders. Attackers believed to be Fulani raided a Dogon village last week, killing at least 35 people.  In March, suspected Dogon militiamen killed more than 150 Fulani in two villages in central Mali, one of the worst acts of bloodshed in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent history.  President Ibrahim Boubacar KeitaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government has vowed to disarm the militias but has struggled to do so. The groups are looked to for security by local communities who do not trust the government to protect them.  On Tuesday, two labour unions representing civil servants called on state administrators in the Mopti region, where most of the attacks have occurred, to leave their posts and decamp to the regional capital due to death threats.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“President Keita said he was going to disarm all the militias. We take note and await the disarmament of the militias and implementation of protection measures,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ousmane Christian Diarra, secretary-general of the National Syndicate of Civil Administrators.  French forces intervened in Mali, a former French colony, in 2013 to push back a jihadist advance from the north.

Both Syria and Russia denied the accusations on Tuesday.  UN aid chief Mark Lowcock told the UN Security Council since late April the World Health Organization had confirmed 26 incidents affecting healthcare facilities in the Idlib region.  Civilian facilities often provide their exact coordinates to military officials involved in conflict zones to help protect them from inadvertent artillery or air strikes.  Lowcock said some hospitals in northwestern Syria were now not sharing their locations with warring parties because it ""paints a target on their back"".  ""Hitting a facility whose coordinates were shared as part of the UN's deconfliction system is simply intolerable,"" said Lowcock. ""A number of partners ... have drawn the conclusion that hospital bombings are a deliberate tactic aimed at terrorising people.""  He said the United Nations was reconsidering its de-confliction system and would inform the UN Security Council next week of its conclusions.  Lowcock told the Security Council since Syrian troops began pushing into Idlib on April 30 an estimated 330,000 people have been forced to flee their homes and more than 230 civilians have died.  'Decisively reject'  Russia and Syria questioned the sources of the UN information on the attacks on civilian infrastructure.  ""We decisively reject any accusation of indiscriminate strikes. We're not carrying out attacks on civilians,"" Russian UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said.  Syrian UN Ambassador Bashar al-Jaafari added: ""Syrians and allies do not target schools or hospitals.""  But other ambassadors suggested the practice was indeed taking place.  ""Many of those in the civilian infrastructure have stopped giving coordinates because they are concerned giving the coordinate means maybe those people who shouldn't get the coordinates receive them and use them,"" said the German Ambassador to the UN Christoph Heusgen.  Marc Pecsteen, Belgian's ambassador to the UN, also supported the accusations.  ""There is no justification whatsoever [for attacks on civilian facilities]. Even in the fight against terrorism, there is no reason to target a school or a hospital,"" said Pecsteen.  190616204404558  Crumbling 'de-escalation'  Idlib is the last remaining bastion of anti-government rebels after eight bloody years of civil war.

""I am deeply concerned about the escalation of the fighting in Idlib, and the situation is especially dangerous given the involvement of an increased number of actors,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters, appealing to Russia and Turkey ""to stabilise the situation without delay"".  ""Let me underscore, even in the fight against terrorism, there needs to be full compliance with international human rights and international law,"" he added.  UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council for Syria's close ally Russia, the presence in Idlib of the former al-Qaeda affiliate Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ""is not tolerable"", and ""for Turkey, time is required to effectively isolate and address HTS' most hardline fighters"".  'Not a humanitarian catastrophe'  Nebenzia said the de-escalation deal with Turkey "" was being fully implemented"" telling Security Council members it ""doesn't ban but rather encourages the fight against terrorism"".  He added all military activities were in response ""to provocations from terrorists"" saying HTS controls 99 percent of the Idlib de-escalation zone.  ""We think that the issue is not that it's a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Nebenzia said.  ""It's clear that the issue is the desire to keep the territories that are not under Damascus' control for as long as possible regardless of who prevails in them.""

Three Russians and a Ukrainian have been charged with bringing a missile into the area in eastern Ukraine and with murdering 298 passengers and crew.  The passenger flight was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over conflict-hit Ukraine.  A court case will begin in the Netherlands on 9 March 2020.  International arrest warrants have been issued for the four men.  The Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT) named the men as Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov from Russia, as well as Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko.  The JIT, which is seeking to try the suspects under Dutch law, had previously said it had a ""long list"" of persons of interest and appealed again for witnesses as the investigation continues.  Who are the suspects?  The most prominent of the four is Igor Girkin (also known as Strelkov), who prosecutors say is a former colonel in Russia's FSB intelligence service. He was given the minister of defence title in the rebel-held eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk.  He is believed to be the highest military officer in the area who was in direct contact with the Russian Federation. In a statement Mr Girkin said: ""I can only say that militia did not shoot down the Boeing.""  Image copyright Reuters Image caption An investigator inspects the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17  The others charged are:  Sergei Dubinsky (known as Khmury), who prosecutors say was employed by Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, was a deputy of Mr Girkin and was in regular contact with Russia  Oleg Pulatov, known as Giurza, who the JIT says was a former soldier of GRU special forces and deputy head of the intelligence service in Donetsk  Ukrainian national Leonid Kharchenko, who has no military background but led a combat unit as a commander in Eastern Ukraine, according to prosecutors  ""These suspects are seen to have played an important role in the death of 298 innocent civilians"", said Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke.  ""Although they did not push the button themselves, we suspect them of close co-operation to get the [missile launcher] where it was, with the aim to shoot down an airplane.""  Investigators, he added, had ""evidence showing that Russia provided the missile launcher"".  The investigative website Bellingcat has named 12 people it accuses of being involved in transporting the missile used to down MH17, including the four charged by the JIT.  What is known about flight MH17?  The passenger jet left Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport at 10:15 GMT on 17 July 2014 and was due to arrive at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia the following day.  A few hours after take-off, the plane lost contact with air traffic control about 50km (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.  At the time, an armed conflict was raging on the ground in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces, and several government military aircraft had been downed in the previous weeks, while air strikes were carried out on rebel-held areas.  The plane crashed in the Donetsk area, in territory controlled by separatists. Parts of the wreckage were found distributed over an area of about 50 sq km (19 square miles).  In October 2015, the Dutch Safety Board concluded the plane had been hit by a Buk missile, causing it to break apart in mid-air.  The JIT - which includes officials from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - concluded in May 2018 that the missile system belonged to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile brigade, based in the western Russian city of Kursk. It produced evidence that it said proved how the missile system had reached eastern Ukraine.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption An animated video from the Dutch Safety Board shows the damage to the plane and how it was caused  Russia responded by denying any of its anti-aircraft missile systems had ever crossed the Ukrainian border. Its foreign ministry has accused the JIT investigation of being ""biased and politically motivated"".  Australia and the Netherlands have both officially held Russia responsible for the crash.  Will the suspects ever face trial?  Under Article 61 of Russia's constitution, no Russian citizen can be extradited to another state.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC before the charges were announced that his country had been given ""no chance to take part"" in the official investigation.  However, unnamed Dutch officials told news agencies that Russia had refused to co-operate with their investigation.  A former rebel official in Donetsk, Andrei Purgin, said it was ""absurd"" to accuse the separatists of involvement in downing the plane, Russia's Interfax news agency reports.  Asked by AFP news agency, Ukrainian security services said they had ""no information"" on Leonid Kharchenko's whereabouts or whether he was even still alive.  What reaction has there been to the charges?  UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Russia ""must co-operate fully with the prosecution and provide any assistance it requests"" in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 2166, which was passed in response to the downing of MH17.  ""The international community stands together against the impunity of those responsible for the despicable murder of 298 innocent people,"" he added.  Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the bringing of charges marked an ""important milestone in the efforts to uncover the full truth and ensure that justice is done"".  Who were the victims?  A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed on the flight.

""We all get older... I hope that I will know the truth before I close my eyes,"" she said.  Barry Sweeney, father of 28-year-old British victim Liam, said he was still looking for the truth.

Doctors are not sure what the cause is, but one theory is that the culprit is a toxin found in lychees eaten by children of poor families who go to bed with empty stomachs.  Advertisement  Advertisement  One of the distraught parents crowding the chaotic corridors of the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) is Dilip Sahni, 25, a construction worker and father of three.  He brought his daughter Muskan, four-and-a-half, early in the morning, only 24 hours after she fell ill, to the SKMCH. There almost 100 other children are being treated, many sharing beds.  ""When her mother went in to wake her yesterday at 11 am, she was shocked to see her hands and legs tightened and her teeth sticking together,"" Sahni told AFP.  ""Her mother started screaming for help, and we rushed her to the Kejriwal hospital. At midnight the hospital doctors told us to take her to SKMCH,"" he said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""Early morning we shifted her here but her condition has been deteriorating,"" Sahni said before breaking down.  Not long afterwards came the news that little Muskan had died.  She was very likely just the latest victim in a health crisis blamed on Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) in the dirt-poor, baking hot eastern state of Bihar.  The onset is lightning fast, its young victims quickly developing a high fever, seizures, and vomiting. All often, if treatment is not swift, leading to death.  A total of 113 children have died so far this month.  ""Obviously it is tough to make ends meet and raise three children. But I try my best. She was a healthy and playful child,"" Sahni had said when he had brought his daughter in.  ""The night before she had eaten bread, she did not have any lychees. It was 10 days ago she had the fruit,"" he said.  'DYING WITH WORRY'  As the hospital guards scream at parents not to crowd the wards, Raju Kumar, 35, a father of five, has just admitted his two-and-half-year-old son to the intensive care unit.  ""I am dying with worry. So many dead bodies of little children I have seen standing here. I am just praying my son is saved somehow,"" Kumar, who owns a clothes shop, told AFP.  ""He fell unconscious suddenly the day before yesterday. We rushed him here immediately,"" he says, holding his four-month-old baby in his arms.  Another being admitted is Krimta Kumari, a girl around nine years old sat on her father's lap in a yellow T-shirt, visibly flushed with fever and unable to keep her eyes open or speak properly.  Just then, there is a power cut, leaving mothers in colourful saris and gold nose studs to try and cool their sick children in the sweltering hospital with hand-held fans.  Bihar, home to almost 100 million people, has also been hit by a heatwave, with temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) killing 184 people this summer - including 78 since Saturday.  SLEEPLESS NIGHTS  Not only is Bihar poor, its healthcare system is in a dire state. For every 100,000 people there are fewer than two health workers, compared to the average for India of around nine, according to the Hindustan Times daily.  ""We as doctors are trying our best to save the lives of as many children as possible,"" said Srikant Prasad Bharti, an overworked junior paediatric doctor at the SKMCH.  ""No one talks about how many sleepless nights we have been spending to look after the sick kids. No one is talking about the children who have been cured. It is easy to blame hospitals and doctors,"" he complained.  This is not the first outbreak of AES in Bihar. But fatalities - until this year - had fallen sharply since 2014, when 355 children died. There were just 33 deaths last year, the Hindustan Times reported.  ""This is happening because the children come from very poor socio-economic backgrounds. The parents couldn't care less whether their children have taken their meals or not,"" Bharti says.  ""The children wander around in heat and eat rotten or unripe lychee and go to bed on empty stomachs. This leads to a sudden drop in blood sugar levels and leads to seizures and convulsions.""

A military source put the toll higher, saying up to 25 soldiers were killed after insurgents travelling on trucks mounted with guns attacked the base on Monday around 5:30 p.m. (1630 GMT). He said fighting lasted for about three hours. A local resident said he saw the bodies of six dead Nigerian soldiers.  The attack in the town of Gajiram, in which the insurgents said the barracks were burnt, followed a similar assault on a base last week and suicide bombings that killed 30 people on Sunday. The attacks raise questions about government assertions to have almost defeated the insurgents.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Twelve Nigerian soldiers were killed and others injured following an attack by Islamic State fighters on their barracks in the northern Nigerian town of Gajiram,Ã¢â‚¬Â Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) said in a statement published on the SITE Intelligence website.

While the elite Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) force said the American aircraft was brought down after flying into Iranian airspace, US officials said the drone was in international territory at the time.  The different accounts couldn't be immediately reconciled.  ""The US-made Global Hawk surveillance drone was brought down"" in the country's southern coastal province of Hormozgan, the force's website said. ""It was shot down when it entered Iran's airspace near the Kouhmobarak district in the south.""  Thursday's incident marks the first direct Iranian-claimed attack on US assets amid the escalating crisis after the US imposed punishing sanctions on Tehran earlier this year and increased military forces in the Gulf.  The US military denied any of its unmanned aerial vehicles entered Iranian airspace.  ""There was no drone over Iranian territory,"" Navy Captain Bill Urban, a US Central Command spokesman, told The Associated Press news agency. He declined further comment.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, two US officials said a MQ-4C Triton US Navy drone was brought down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz.  No further details were immediately available, including the time of the shootdown.  'Clear message'  Conerns are sky high a miscalculation could push the US and Iran into an open conflict.  The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard said on Thursday the shooting down of the drone sent ""a clear message"" to the United States.  General Hossein Salami also said Iran does ""not have any intention for war with any country, but we are ready for war"", in a speech carried live on Iranian state television.  A senior Iranian security official said on Wednesday Iran would ""strongly respond"" to any violation of its territory.  ""Our airspace is our red line and Iran has always responded and will continue to respond strongly to any country that violates our airspace,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council as saying.  Thursday's shootdown comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US after President Donald Trump last year pulled out of historic 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers and reimposed sanctions on the country.  The US military has sent additional troops with aircraft carriers and B-52 bombers to the Middle East. However, Trump said he does not seek war with Iran.  Sky-high tensions  Fears of conflict have risen after two oil tankers came under attack a week ago near the Strait of Hormuz - a major oil shipping route where one-fifth of the world's oil passes from the Middle East to world markets.  The US and its regional allies - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - have accused Iran of being behind the series of attacks in the Gulf.  Tehran has denied its involvement and instead suggested Washington could be responsible, using it to justify force against Iran.  On Wednesday, the US Navy said recovered fragments from one of two tanker ships bore a ""striking resemblance"" to mines seen during Iranian military parades.  Iran has repeatedly denied any responsibility in the June explosions, as well as similar blasts on May 12 off the coast of the UAE that targeted four oil-carrying vessels.  Meanwhile, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook headed to the Middle East for meetings in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain to discuss ""Iran's regional aggression"", the State Department said.  ""He will also share additional US intelligence on the range of active threats Iran currently poses to the region,"" it said in a statement.  In protest at Trump's ""maximum pressure"" sanctions strategy, Iran announced in May it would start enriching uranium at a higher level unless European signatories to the nuclear deal protected its oil and banking sectors within 60 days.

3074021,cnn,Bianca Britton,"The US-Iran crisis, explained",https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/politics/iran-us-brink-of-war-explainer-intl/index.html,21/6/2019 0:00,22/6/2019 13:37,"(CNN) Tensions between the US and Iran are at their highest level in years after Tehran shot down an American drone on Thursday.  The confrontation has raised fears that a conflict between the two countries would quickly spiral into a wider war that could consume the entire region.  Here's a look at how we got here.  Why is this happening now?  The roots of the latest Iran-US crisis go back to 2018, when US President Donald Trump walked away from the Iranian nuclear deal, one of the signature achievements of his predecessor Barack Obama, and reimposed harsh sanctions on the country.  Iran has since threatened to exceed enrichment limits allowed under the nuclear deal and is accused by the US of taking actions across the Middle East, designed to put pressure on the Trump administration.  Iran has categorically denied responsibility for the ship attacks.  An oil tanker on fire near the strategic Strait of Hormuz on Thursday, June 13, 2019.  Relations between the two nations appeared to take a dangerous turn on Monday, when the Trump administration announced the deployment of 1,000 additional troops and extra military resources to the Middle East.  Washington said it was in response to ""hostile behavior by Iranian forces that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region.""  The Strait of Hormuz -- which is only 21 miles wide at its narrowest point -- is the only way to move oil from Persian Gulf producers to the world's oceans, which is why the attack on the two ships in the nearby Gulf of Oman was such a concern.  Tensions in the area affect oil prices and if the strait were closed due to the threat of ongoing attacks, it could dramatically impact the world economy.  What happened with the drone?  On Thursday, Iran's Revolutionary Guard said it had shot down an ""intruding American spy drone"" after it entered into the country's territory.  While the US confirmed a drone had indeed been brought down, the Trump administration insists the incident occurred in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz.  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps released images of what it said were pieces of a US drone shot down in Iran's airspace.  Tehran's downing of a US drone was a warning that the Iranian army forces are capable of countering any ""foreign aggression,"" the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Major General Hossein Salami said.  He released a strongly worded statement Thursday saying the nation did ""not want war with any country,"" but it was ""completely, and totally, ready and prepared for war."" This sentiment did not go down particularly well with Trump, who tweeted that ""Iran made a very big mistake.""  Iran made a very big mistake! Ã¢â‚¬â€ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2019  However, the President later downplayed those words, calling the shootdown ""a new wrinkle, a new fly in the ointment"" and that he found it ""hard to believe it was intentional.""  Both Washington and Tehran continue to argue over the location of the downing, with Iran maintaining it was shot down over its territory.  Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted a timeline of the incident Thursday, which included coordinates of where he says the drone was targeted.  At 00:14 US drone took off from UAE in stealth mode & violated Iranian airspace. It was targeted at 04:05 at the coordinates (25Ã‚Â°59'43""N 57Ã‚Â°02'25""E) near Kouh-e Mobarak.    We've retrieved sections of the US military drone in OUR territorial waters where it was shot down. pic.twitter.com/pJ34Tysmsg Ã¢â‚¬â€ Javad Zarif (@JZarif) June 20, 2019  The US countered Iran's claims with its own coordinates, suggesting the drone had instead been flying in international airspace -- at a point around nine nautical miles southwest of Iran's coordinates.  Why is everyone talking about international waters and airspace?  The precise location of where the US drone was shot down has become a key point of contention.  Iran is likely to be able to legally justify its response in shooting down the drone if it had indeed violated sovereign airspace, especially if it was engaging in ""spying and information gathering.""  It could then use the justification of self-defense -- walking a fine line between sending a signal to the Trump administration, while also avoiding military retaliation.  ""The Iranians are clearly trying to demonstrate their ability to defend themselves and to deter further American action. They probably assumed that by targeting a drone, they could send that message at minimal risk,"" said CNN's military analyst John Kirby , a retired Navy Rear Admiral.  How close is the US to war?  Trump is now caught between Republicans demanding a response to the downing of the drone, and congressional Democrats warning that the president could lose control of the situation and lead the US into war.  Overnight Thursday, Trump abruptly called off military strikes against Iran after previously approving them in retaliation for the drone shooting.  ""We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights,"" Trump tweeted on Friday.  ""10 minutes before the strike I stopped it.""  Causing so many casualties, he added, would not have been ""proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.""  ....proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting & more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD! Ã¢â‚¬â€ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2019  The US military targets would have been a limited set of Iranian radars and missile batteries, a US official with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information. No US weapons had been launched when the decision was made to call it off.  The New York Times first reported the aborted strikes.  President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on June 20.  What would the conflict look like?  The last time the US went to war in the Middle East was 2003 in Iraq. But a war with Iran would likely look different, with Iran possibly using its networks of regional proxies to target the US and its allies far from Tehran.  While by every conventional military metric the US would outgun Iran, America's biggest vulnerability is regional stability and the cost to the global economy -- which is what Iran is counting on.  While the US may be able to count on Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates if it wanted to act on recent tensions with Iran, it won't find many other eager volunteers, CNN's Ben Wedeman reports.  The Trump administration alienated European allies by walking away from the Iran deal last year. The French and Germans in particular are unlikely to back military action, and the United Kingdom -- consumed by Brexit -- probably won't have the appetite either, says Wedeman.  Even with the help from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the US won't come near to the firepower and political support President George W. Bush was able to muster in his ""coalition of the willing"" during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Meanwhile, Iran has plenty of potential resources at its disposal, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and an array of militias in Iraq. Tehran may also be able to call on its close ties with Syria, after helping to keep President Bashar al-Assad in power.",en,terrorattack,,
3074228,bbci,Reality Check Team Bbc News,Syria: Who's in control of Idlib?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45401474,,22/6/2019 13:53,"The northern Syrian province of Idlib is the last remaining stronghold controlled by forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.  Syrian government forces, backed by their Russian allies, have stepped up bombardment of the rebel-held territory.  According to the UN, nearly 300 people have died in Idlib province and more than 300,000 people have been displaced since the escalation of violence in May.  Russia and Syria have accused groups controlling the area of violating the ceasefire agreement and carrying out attacks against civilians and military positions.  In September last year, Russia, Turkey and Iran agreed to extend a ceasefire across north-west Syria and impose a 30km (18.6 mile) buffer zone between opposing forces.  Who controls Idlib?  Idlib has been controlled by a number of rival factions, rather than a single group, since it fell to the opposition in 2015.  The main armed groups operating there are:  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, a jihadist alliance)  National Liberation Front (Turkish-backed rebel alliance)  Hurras al-Din (pro-al-Qaeda HTS offshoot)  Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP, Chinese Uighur-dominated jihadist group)  In January 2019, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance of jihadists groups, launched a large-scale offensive against rival rebel groups in the area.  HTS has now become one of the strongest militant groups in northern Syria. It largely controls Idlib province, including the provincial capital and the border crossing with Turkey at Bab al-Hawa.  HTS is the latest incarnation of al-Nusra Front, which was al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria.  In 2016, al-Nusra Front declared that it had severed formal ties with the al-Qaeda network and renamed itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.  The following year, it merged with several small jihadist groups fighting in Syria and formed HTS.  Although HTS insists it is independent and not linked to an external entity, the UN, US and Turkey consider it a group associated with al-Qaeda and list it as a terrorist organisation.  Although independent analysts are cautious about making estimates, Charles Lister, of the US-based Middle East Institute, says he believes HTS has roughly 15,000 full-time fighters, and several thousand more civilian employees.  ""Beyond HTS, Idlib is also home to at least a dozen other jihadist groups, most of whom remain more openly loyal to al-Qaeda - they probably command a rough total of 7,500 more men at arms,"" he says.  The top US general is reported to have estimated that there were 20,000 to 30,000 militants in Idlib, while the UN - in a report published in January - estimated there were 20,000 fighters in Idlib associated with HTS, including many foreigners.  Syrian government supporters say the numbers are significantly higher.  Pro-government MP, Fares Shehabi, told BBC Reality Check that currently there are as many as 100,000 HTS fighters in Idlib.  He believes HTS is affiliated to al-Qaeda despite its denials. ""They carry al-Qaeda flags, they practise al-Qaeda methods,"" he said  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption HTS is the most powerful group in the only remaining area still held by rebels in Syria  Other groups  The other significant force is the National Liberation Front (NLF), which was formed in 2018 by rebel factions wanting to counter HTS.  It is a Turkish-backed alliance that includes hardline Islamist groups like Ahrar al-Sham, as well as several groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army - a force considered more ""moderate"" by Western powers.  Earlier this year, NLF lost most of the area under its control in northern Syria to HTS after fighting broke out between the two groups. NLF reached an agreement recognising the HTS-backed administration, and since then the two groups have been fighting together against recent Syrian government assaults.  Aron Lund, a fellow with the US-based research group The Century Foundation, says the NLF is held together by Turkish leadership, as well as Turkish money, weapons and supplies.  ""The NLF will stand or fall with Turkey's involvement in Syria,"" he says.  There are other groups as well.  One is Hurras al-Din (Guardians of Religion), a splinter group from HTS that is widely believed to be al-Qaeda's new affiliate in Syria.  Hurras al-Din is largely made up of HTS defectors and the two groups have so far found it difficult to set aside their differences and work together beyond occasional, limited collaboration.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Idlib is the last rebel stronghold - if re-taken it would effectively signal the opposition's defeat  Foreign militants  There are also many foreign jihadists in Idlib, many of whom are fighting for groups associated with al-Qaeda.  The Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) is a group of Uighur fighters, who mostly fight alongside HTS.  The Uighurs - a Muslim ethnic minority primarily based in China's Xinjiang province - established a presence in northern Syria in the early years of the civil war.  There are also the predominantly-Uzbek Tawhid and Jihad Brigade, which is aligned with HTS, and the Imam al-Bukhari Brigade.  ""We believe there are about 30-40,000 foreign fighters mainly Uighur, Tajik, Uzbek, Turks, and others from 103 nationalities - many with their migrated families,"" says Syrian MP Fares Shehabi.  But Raffaello Pantucci, of the UK-based security think tank the Royal United Services Institute, believes this number is too high.  ""They and their families may not number more than several thousand,"" he says.  There are also believed to be other foreign jihadists in Idlib, including Chechens and Uzbeks, although the numbers are likely to be smaller.  Civilians trapped in Idlib  A major concern now is for the civilians living in Idlib.  The UN estimates it is home to 3 million people, including 1 million children.  More than 40% of these come from other areas previously held by opposition forces.  UN officials say as many as 800,000 people could be displaced by a full-scale offensive on the province, and that the number of people needing aid in Syria - currently two million - could increase dramatically.

This comes as dengue cases spike in the region, indicating that the Aedes mosquito - the carrier of the disease - may be thriving with a warmer weather pattern this year.  At a media sharing session in commemoration of Asean Dengue Day 2019 a week ago, a panel of experts also raised concerns about patients over 65, who tend to suffer more, yet typically do not display the usual dengue symptoms.  These patients are likely to have contributed to the small uptick in the average hospitalisation rate for the disease in recent years.  Singapore is in the midst of a dengue outbreak, with five reported deaths from the disease so far this year. As of last Monday, there were 5,261 infections reported, a 60 per cent increase over the total for the whole of last year, and close to double of 2017's overall numbers.  Associate Professor Ng Lee Ching, director of National Environment Agency's (NEA) Environmental Health Institute, said Singapore has low herd immunity against the disease as good mosquito control over the years means that many people have never been infected.  An NEA study on the prevalence of the disease in healthy adults showed that only about 16 per cent of Singapore's youth aged between 16 and 20 years in 2009 had had dengue before, she said.  5,261  Number of dengue infections reported this year as of last Monday, a 60 per cent surge over that for the whole of last year.  The study, which is the latest one available on the topic, was published in 2015.  A recovered patient is immune to the particular strain of dengue he or she was infected with.  ""When we say we have low herd immunity and that we are very sensitive to outbreaks, that means that we just need a few mosquitoes to have an outbreak,"" said Prof Ng.  Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said a particular group of concern was the elderly.  A study published last month that reviewed dengue hospitalisations showed a higher proportion of dengue patients hospitalised from 2003 to 2017 were the elderly. In 2017, 47.2 per cent of dengue patients admitted to hospitals were aged 65 and above.  This has probably contributed to the slight increase in the average hospitalisation rate for dengue, from 2014's low of 25.6 per cent, to 2017's 35.9 per cent, said Prof Leo.  The elderly tend to face more complications with the disease because they may have existing chronic conditions, and they are more susceptible to secondary infections, she said.  Another factor which compounds the problem is the difficulty of diagnosing dengue in the elderly, as they tend not to display the typical symptoms such as fever, body aches and rash, according to experts.  Dr Wong Wei Mon, a senior physician with the College of Family Physicians Singapore, said the elderly may have only fever or nausea when they visit the doctor, or may even have symptoms not listed as common dengue symptoms.  ""Doctors, if they are not alert enough, may not trigger the definitive test to confirm the presence of dengue,"" said Dr Wong. By the time they are diagnosed, the disease may be severe, he added.  To combat this, the authorities have been urging doctors to keep a keen eye out for dengue among the elderly, said the experts.  The NEA, too, has been ramping up efforts to prevent mosquito breeding, such as introducing Aedes moquitoes infected with the Wolbachia bacteria into the wild to help reduce the mosquito population, said Dr Christina Liew, NEA's medical entomologist.",en,diseas,,

""I'm not looking for war,"" Trump said on Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press programme.  The downing of a US surveillance drone on Thursday by Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had brought the two foes to the brink of war. Tehran said the drone violated its airspace but Washington insisted it was flying over international waters in the Gulf.  Trump had earlier said that he called off a military attack to retaliate for the downing of the unmanned aircraft out of concern it would have been a disproportionate response.  Trump has indicated that he would also be prepared to seek a deal to bolster Iran's flagging economy, an apparent move to defuse tensions.  ""I think they want to negotiate. And I think they want to make a deal. And my deal is nuclear. Look, they're not going to have a nuclear weapon,"" Trump said.  Last year, Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 accord between Iran and world powers that curbed Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for easing sanctions. Relations in the region have worsened significantly since then.  'Negotiate with no preconditions'  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is on his way to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), reiterated on Sunday that Washington wanted talks with Tehran.  ""We're prepared to negotiate with no preconditions,"" he said. ""They know precisely how to find us. I am confident that at the very moment they're ready to truly engage with us we'll be able to begin these conversations. I'm looking forward to that day.""  If a conflict breaks out in the region, no country would be able to manage its scope and timing. Iran's Major General Gholamali Rashid  Pompeo also said ""significant"" sanctions on Iran would be announced on Monday aimed at further choking off resources that Tehran uses to fund its activities in the region.  ""We are going to deny them the resources they need to do that, thereby keeping American interests and American people safe all around the world,"" Pompeo said before leaving for the Middle East.  Iran played down the impact of any new US sanctions. They were ""just propaganda, as all sanctions ... have been imposed and there are no more sanctions left"", state-run news agency IRIB quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying.  On Thursday, Iran shot down a $130m Global Hawk drone [Handout/US Air Force/AFP]  Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and refers to a fatwa or religious decree issued in the early 2000s by Iran's top authority Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that bans the development or use of nuclear weapons.  But a hawk in Trump administration, National Security Advisor John Bolton, sought to maintain military pressure on Iran.  ""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness. No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East,"" Bolton said during a visit to Israel.  Iran has said it would respond firmly to any threat and warned on Sunday of the risks of a military confrontation.  ""If a conflict breaks out in the region, no country would be able to manage its scope and timing,"" Major General Gholamali Rashid said, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency.  ""The American government must act responsibly to protect the lives of American troops by avoiding misconduct in the region.""  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani accused the Americans of stoking tensions through what Iran has called the violation of its airspace by the US military drone, Fars reported.  Diplomatic efforts  Diplomatic efforts are under way to ease tensions following attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf in recent weeks that the US blames on Iran and the shooting down of the drone last week. Tehran has denied involvement in the tanker attacks, which no one has claimed responsibility for.  In the past several weeks, at least six tankers have come under attack, raising tensions in the region [File: EPA]  Andrew Murrison, Britain's minister for the Middle East and North Africa, said on Sunday that he had ""open, frank and constructive"" talks with Iranian government representatives in Tehran.  ""I reiterated the UK's assessment that Iran almost certainly bears responsibility for recent attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman,"" Murrison said and called for such activity to stop.  The United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union are signatories to the 2015 deal and Tehran wants the Europeans to shield Iran from the Trump administration's sanctions through a trade mechanism.  After the talks with Murrison, Iran said it would not back down from its decision in May to reduce some of its commitments under the pact, state TV quoted Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi as saying.  ""The European signatories of the deal lack the will to save the deal. Our decision to decrease our commitment to the deal is a national decision and it is irreversible as long as our demands are not met,"" Araqchi said.  Another source of regional tension is the more than four-year-old Saudi-UAE-led war in Yemen that has pushed millions towards the brink of famine.  In recent weeks, the Houthis who have been fighting the Saudi-led coalition, have stepped up attacks on Saudi border regions. In the latest assault, one person was killed and seven others wounded in an attack on Abha airport close to the Yemen border.  The Saudi-UAE coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognised President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi who was overthrown by the Iran-aligned Houthis in late 2014.",en,terrorattack,746,['Iran']

The attack on Abha airport, which the coalition said left a McDonalds outlet at the site littered with shattered glass and damaged 18 vehicles, comes amid spiralling regional tensions with Iran.  The escalation of attacks by Iran-aligned Huthi rebels on Saudi cities threatens a hard-won UN-sponsored ceasefire deal for the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, war-ravaged Yemen's main conduit for humanitarian aid.  ""A terrorist attack by the Iran-backed Huthi militia on Abha airport... killed a Syrian resident and wounded 21 civilians,"" the coalition said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.  The wounded -- from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, India and Bangladesh -- also included three women and two children who had been taken to hospital for treatment, the coalition said.  It did not provide details on how the airport was attacked, but Iran-aligned Huthi rebels have repeatedly struck the civilian facility this month with drones and missiles.  Earlier on Sunday, the rebels' Al-Masirah TV said they had targeted Abha and Jizan airports in the south of the kingdom with drones.  The coalition did not confirm the attack on Jizan airport.  Abha airport authorities said on Twitter that air traffic had resumed and operatons were running normally, without saying how long they were disrupted.  On June 12, a rebel missile attack on Abha airport wounded 26 civilians, drawing promises of ""stern action"" from the coalition.  Human Rights Watch denounced the strike as an apparent ""war crime"", urging the Huthis to immediately stop all attacks on civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia.  The latest raids come amid spiralling regional tensions after Washington -- a key ally of Riyadh -- accused Iran of shooting down a US drone and carrying out attacks on oil tankers in the strategic Gulf of Oman.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and the US, in a joint statement published on Saudi state media on Sunday, voiced alarm over escalating regional tensions and the ""dangers posed by Iranian destabilising activity"".  Saudi Arabia has repeatedly accused Iran of supplying sophisticated weapons to Huthi rebels, a charge Tehran denies.  Following recent attacks, Saudi state media have reported an intensification of coalition air raids on rebel positions in the northern Yemeni province of Hajjah and the Huthi-held capital Sanaa.  The coalition intervened in support of the Yemeni government in 2015 when President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled into Saudi exile as the rebels closed in on his last remaining territory in and around second city Aden.  Since then, the conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, many of them civilians, relief agencies say.  It has triggered what the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 24 million Yemenis -- more than two-thirds of the population -- in need of aid.  On Thursday the Saudi campaign in Yemen suffered a double blow as US lawmakers voted to block Trump's arms sales to Riyadh, just hours after Britain temporarily suspended similar sales.",en,terrorattack,,

Last week the United States came as close as it has ever come to bombing Iran, when President Donald Trump aborted a retaliatory air strike just minutes before impact.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Trump said he decided the strike, to punish Iran for shooting down a drone, would have killed too many people.  The confrontation has escalated since May, when Washington sharply tightened economic sanctions on Iran, ordering all countries to halt imports of Iranian oil, in what the Trump administration says is an effort to force Tehran to open talks on its nuclear and missile programmes and regional behaviour.  In recent weeks, Washington has blamed Tehran for attacks on tankers in the Gulf, which Iran denies. Iran shot down the drone, saying it had flown over its air space. Washington says it was in international skies.  The United States, which accuses Iran of encouraging allies in Yemen to attack Saudi targets, is expected to announce another round of new sanctions this week.  Advertisement  Advertisement  U.S. media have reported that Washington launched cyber attacks last week even as Trump called off his air strike. The Washington Post said on Saturday that the cyber strikes, which had been planned previously, had disabled Iranian rocket launch systems. U.S. officials have declined to comment.  FEARS OF WAR  But Iran dismissed the cyber attacks as a failure.  ""They try hard, but have not carried out a successful attack,"" Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, Iran's minister for information and communications technology, said on Twitter.  sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget  ""Media asked if the claimed cyber attacks against Iran are true,"" he said. ""Last year we neutralised 33 million attacks with the (national) firewall.""  Allies of the United States have been calling for steps to defuse the crisis, saying they fear a small mistake by either side could trigger war.  ""We are very concerned. We don't think either side wants a war, but we are very concerned that we could get into an accidental war and we are doing everything we can to ratchet things down,"" British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo jetted to the Middle East to discuss Iran with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two Gulf Arab allies that favour a hard line. Pompeo met King Salman as well as the king's son, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  Discussions focused on maritime security in the Gulf after the attacks on the tankers. ""Freedom of navigation is paramount,"" Pompeo tweeted from Jeddah. Trump tweeted that other countries should do more to protect their own ships in a waterway guarded for decades by the U.S. Fifth Fleet.  The U.S. special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, visited Oman and was headed to Europe to explain U.S. policy to allies. He told European reporters on a phone call ahead of his arrival that Trump was willing to sit down with Iran, but that Iran must do a deal before sanctions could be lifted.  CONCESSIONS  U.S.-Iran relations have deteriorated over the past year since the United States abandoned a 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers designed to curb Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions.  Washington argues that the agreement known as the JCPOA, negotiated under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, did not go far enough, and new sanctions are needed to force Iran back to the table to make more concessions.  Throughout the escalation, both sides have suggested they are willing to hold talks while demanding the other side move first. In the latest comment from Tehran, an adviser to President Hassan Rouhani repeated a longstanding demand that Washington lift sanctions before any talks.  But the adviser, Hesameddin Ashena, also tweeted a rare suggestion that Iran could be willing to discuss new concessions, if Washington were willing to put new incentives on the table that go beyond those in the deal.  ""If they want something beyond the JCPOA, they should offer something beyond the JCPOA; with international guarantees.""  Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, was quoted by ISNA news agency as saying on Monday Tehran did not ""want a rise of tensions and its consequences"".  U.S. allies in Europe and Asia view Trump's decision to abandon the nuclear deal as a mistake that strengthens hardliners in Iran and weakens the pragmatic faction of Rouhani.  Trump has suggested that he backed off the military strike against Iran in part because he was not sure the country's top leadership had intended to shoot down the drone. However, an Iranian commander said Tehran was prepared to do it again.  ""Everyone saw the downing of the unmanned drone,"" navy commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi was quoted on Sunday as saying by the Tasnim news agency. ""I can assure you that this firm response can be repeated, and the enemy knows it.""

3109165,channelnewsasia,None,Why the military still stands by Venezuela's beleaguered president,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/why-the-military-still-stands-by-venezuela-s-beleaguered-11671294,,29/6/2019 0:11,"CARACAS: One of the central mysteries of Venezuela's slow-motion collapse: Why does the military continue to support Nicolas Maduro, the president who has led the once-prosperous South American country into poverty and chaos?  The answer, according to people familiar with Venezuela's military structure, starts with Maduro's late predecessor, Hugo Chavez, the charismatic caudillo who cemented strongman socialist rule in the nation of about 30 million people.  Advertisement  Advertisement  In a series of actions that began in 1999, the former lieutenant colonel and one-time coup leader began taming the military by bloating it, buying it off, politicising it, intimidating the rank and file, and fragmenting the overall command.  Once he took office in 2013, Maduro handed key segments of the country's increasingly ravaged economy to the armed forces. Select military officers took control of the distribution of food and key raw materials. A National Guard general and military deputies now manage the all-important national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA .  The two leaders also embedded intelligence agents, with the help of Cuba's security services, within barracks, former officers say, instilling paranoia and defusing most dissent before it happens. Intelligence agents have arrested and jailed scores of perceived troublemakers, including several high-profile officers, even for minor infractions.  The overhaul, former military officials say, created a jumbled and partisan chain of command. Top officers, grateful for perks and fearful of retribution, are often more preoccupied with pleasing Socialist Party chiefs than with national defence. Instead of drills and war games, some generals find themselves fielding calls to plant vegetables or clear garbage.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Many lower-ranking soldiers, destitute and desperate like most of Venezuela's working class, have deserted the military in recent years, joining at least 4 million other fellow emigres seeking a better life elsewhere. But few senior officers have heeded the opposition's call for rebellion, leaving the armed forces top-heavy, unwieldy and still standing by Maduro.  ""The chain of command has been lost,"" said Cliver Alcala, a former general who retired in 2013 and now supports the opposition from Colombia. ""There is no way to know who is in charge of operations, who is in charge of administration and who is in charge of policy.""  Some commanders, like Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino, a four-star general, are nearly as much a face of the administration as Maduro. Padrino is sanctioned by the United States for ensuring Maduro's ""hold on the military and the government while the Venezuelan people suffer,"" according to the U.S. Treasury Department.  Reuters was unable to reach Padrino or other senior officers mentioned in this article. Venezuela's defence ministry didn't reply to email or telephone inquiries. The country's information ministry, responsible for government communications including those of the president, didn't reply to Reuters either.  Padrino is hardly alone.  Consider the sheer number of officers awarded flag rank in Venezuela.  The country's roughly 150,000 Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard troops are a fraction of the more than 1 million who make up the U.S. armed forces. Yet Venezuela, with as many as 2,000 admirals and generals, now boasts as much as twice the top brass as the U.S. military Ã¢â‚¬â€œ more than 10 times as many flag officers as existed when Chavez became president.  The estimate is according to calculations by former Venezuelan officers and the U.S. military.  The result, government opponents say, is a bureaucratic and operational mess, even at the very top.  Padrino, for instance, is both a general and defence minister. But he can't officially mobilise troops without the consent of Remigio Ceballos, an admiral who also reports directly to Maduro and heads the Strategic Operations Command, an agency created by Chavez to oversee deployments.  ""You have a general in chief and an admiral in chief,"" said Hebert Garcia, a retired general who once served under Maduro but now supports the opposition from Washington. ""Which one are you supposed to obey?""  The armed forces could still turn on Maduro, particularly if popular outrage boils over and makes military support for the president untenable. Still, calls by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who in late April unsuccessfully sought to rally the troops against Maduro, thus far remain unheeded.  Guaido in May told reporters his efforts to convert troops are thwarted by the military's fragmented structure and intimidation within its ranks. ""What is preventing the break?"" he asked. ""The ability to speak openly, directly with each of the sectors. It has to do with the persecution inside the Socialist Party, inside the armed forces.""  To better understand the pressures and policies keeping the troops in Maduro's camp, Reuters interviewed dozens of current and former officers, soldiers, military scholars and people familiar with Venezuelan security. In their assessment, the military has evolved into a torpid bureaucracy with few leaders capable of engineering the type of mass mutiny that Maduro's opponents long for.  ""REAL POWER""  Venezuela's ""Bolivarian Revolution,"" as Chavez dubbed his remaking of the country, itself has roots in military rebellion. Six years before he was elected president in 1998, Chavez led a failed coup against Carlos Andres Perez, a deeply unpopular president who Congress eventually forced from office.  Once in power, Chavez immediately took steps to enlist the military in his vision for a paternalistic, state-led economy that would share abundant oil wealth with long-neglected segments of Venezuela's population.  With a new constitution in December 1999, Chavez stripped Congress of its oversight of promotion of senior officers. That gave the president ultimate authority to assign flag ranks and empower allied officers.  Because many state and local governments at the time were still controlled by rivals, Chavez also saw the military as a tool that could show his administration hard at work. A new programme, ""Plan Bolivar 2000,"" ordered troops to fill potholes, clean highways, refurbish schools and carry out other public works.  The US$114 million effort put sizeable sums at the discretion of commanders, giving officers a taste for a new kind of influence. ""What Plan Bolivar 2000 taught officers was that real power doesn't lie in commanding troops, but rather in controlling money,"" said one retired general. The general, who served under Chavez and Maduro, spoke on condition of anonymity.  Soon, some of the funds began to disappear.  Miguel Morffe, a retired major, once worked as a captain in the remote northwestern region of La Guajira. He recalls receiving a request from superiors to provide materials for an unspecified schoolhouse. When Morffe told a lieutenant colonel that he didn't understand where the supplies would be going, the superior told him: ""I need those materials for something else.""  ""The school didn't exist,"" Morffe concluded.  Military officials didn't reply to questions about the alleged incident.  By 2001, a raft of corruption allegations plagued the Plan Bolivar programme.  Chavez fired General Victor Cruz, the Army's commander in charge of the programme. Cruz denied wrongdoing and wasn't charged with any crime at the time. Venezuelan authorities arrested him last year when press reports linked him to funds in an offshore account. A Caracas court in May ordered him to stand trial on charges of illicit enrichment.  Reuters couldn't reach Cruz for comment or identify his legal counsel.  In 2002, Chavez said he would wind down Plan Bolivar 2000.  Regional elections, he told Chilean sociologist and political activist Marta Harnecker in an interview, had put more allies in mayoral and state offices, where they could now work in unison with the national government. The military, he said, would return to its normal business.  That April, however, a small group of top officers emboldened Chavez to further remake the armed forces. Encouraged by conservative leaders and wealthy elites unhappy with his leftist agenda, the officers staged a coup and briefly arrested Chavez.  But the coup unravelled. Within two days, Chavez was back in power.  He purged the top ranks. More importantly, he reined in several powerful offices, including the Defence Ministry. Henceforth, the ministry would manage military budgets and weapons procurement, but no longer control troops themselves. Chavez created the Strategic Operations Command, the agency that manages deployments.  The move, former officers say, jumbled the chain of command.  He also rethought overall strategy.  Increasingly concerned that Venezuela's oil wealth and leftist policies would make it a target for invasion, particularly by the United States, Chavez pushed for the military to integrate further with the government and society itself.  ""We're transforming the armed forces for a war of resistance, for the anti-imperialist popular war, for the integral defence of the nation,"" he said at a 2004 National Guard ceremony.  Military leaders soon had to pledge their allegiance to Chavez and his Bolivarian project, not just the nation itself. Despite resistance from some commanders, the ruling party slogan, ""Fatherland, Socialism or Death,"" began echoing through barracks and across parade grounds.  As of 2005, another factor helped Chavez tighten his hold on power. Oil prices, years before fracking would boost global supply, soared along with the notion the planet's reserves were dwindling. For most of the rest of his time in power, the windfall would enable Chavez to accelerate spending and ensure popular support.  Oil money also helped him strengthen relationships with like-minded countries, especially those seeking to counterbalance the United States. Venezuela purchased billions of dollars in arms and equipment from Russia and China. It secured medical and educational support through doctors, teachers and other advisors arriving from Cuba, the closest ally of all.  Cubans came with military know-how, too.  A ""cooperation agreement"" forged between Chavez and Fidel Castro years earlier had by now blossomed into an alliance on security matters, according to two former officers. Around 2008, Venezuelan officers say they began noticing Cuban officials working within various parts of the armed forces.  General Antonio Rivero, who the previous five years had managed Venezuela's civil protection authority, says he returned to military activities that year to find Cuban advisors leading training of soldiers and suggesting operational and administrative changes.  The Cubans, he told Reuters, advised Chavez to rework the ranks, once built around strategic centres, into more of a territorial system, spreading the military's presence further around the country. Rivero was stunned at one training session on military engineering. A Cuban colonel leading the session told attendees the meeting and its contents should be considered a state secret.  ""What's happening here?"" Rivero said he asked himself. ""How is a foreign military force going to possess a state secret?""  Rivero left Venezuela for the United States in 2014.  Cuban officials didn't respond to requests from Reuters for comment.  The island's influence soon would become apparent in day-to-day operations.  In Cuba, the military is involved in everything from public works to telecommunications to tourism. In Venezuela, too, ruling party officials increasingly began ordering officers to take part in activities that had little to do with military preparedness. Soldiers increasingly became cheap labour for governors and mayors.  In 2010, a former general working in the Andes, a western region on the Colombian border, was overseeing a complex mobilization of 5,000 troops for a month of combat training. The general spoke on condition that he not be named.  Another general, from a nearby command, called and asked him to halt the exercises. The state governor, the other officer told the general, wanted to reroute the troops - to install energy-efficient light bulbs in homes.  When the general refused, Army Commander Euclides Campos issued a formal order to scrap the training. ""This would sound shocking to any military professional, but it's exactly how the Venezuelan armed forces work,"" the former general said.  Reuters was unable to reach Campos for comment.  ""TRAITORS NEVER!""  Chavez, stricken by cancer, died in 2013. Maduro, his vice president and hand-picked replacement as the Socialist party candidate for president, won the election to succeed him.  The new president continued naming new flag officers and appointed even more military officials to helm agencies. By 2017, active and former military figures had held as many as half of Maduro's 32 cabinet posts, according to Citizen Control, a Venezuelan non-profit that studies the armed forces.  In 2014, just as a collapse in oil prices torpedoed Venezuela's economy, Maduro further fragmented the military structure.  Following the advice of the Cubans, former military officers say, Maduro created new command centres nationwide. He appointed senior officers to run new commands in each of the 23 states and Caracas, the capital, as well as eight regional commands above those. His public speeches are now increasingly peppered with terms like ZODI and REDI, acronyms for the new commands.  Near military facilities, new brass abounded.  ""Before, seeing a general was like seeing a bishop or an archbishop, he was an important figure,"" recalls Morffe, the retired major. ""Not long ago, I saw one in an airport. He walked past a group of soldiers and they didn't even salute.""  Flag officers now oversee some areas that were once slivers of larger commands, in areas so remote that they have few human inhabitants. The largest landmass in the Western Maritime and Insular Command, overseen by an admiral, is a rocky archipelago with little vegetation and no permanent residents.  The officer, Vice Admiral Rodolfo Sanchez, didn't respond to a Reuters phone call to his office.  The lopsided, partisan structure has led to mission creep, former officers say.  In the Andes command, which oversees three states, six generals once oversaw roughly 13,000 troops, according to officers familiar with the region. Today, at least 20 generals are now managing ranks that have dwindled to as few as 3,000 soldiers, according to officers familiar with the region.  Last August, three of the generals, including the regional commander, met with municipal officials in the state of Tachira, a hotbed of protests against Maduro in recent years. Days earlier, the government had said explosives used in a drone attack on a military parade in Caracas had been smuggled through Tachira from Colombia.  ""All of us together can solve this problem,"" Major General Manuel Bernal told the assembled officers and a group of onlookers, including a Reuters reporter.  Bernal wasn't talking about the drones, however. Or even national security, once a major issue in the Andean region, where Colombia's guerrilla war long posed a threat. Instead, the generals had gathered to talk about trash overflowing at a landfill. They deployed soldiers to clear garbage and put out a fire there.  A communications official for the Andes command didn't respond to a Reuters request to speak with Bernal about the episode.  Military bosses show few signs of shying away from such directives. In the weeks since Guaido's failed call to arms, senior officers have reiterated their commitment to Maduro.  ""We will continue fulfilling our constitutional duties, fulfilling duties under your command,"" Defence Minister Padrino told Maduro alongside troops gathered in Caracas in early May.  ""Loyal always!"" Padrino shouted.  The troops responded in unison: ""Traitors never!""  ",en,terrorattack,,

The attack on Friday is the latest in a rash of public assaults against three pro-democracy activists this year - with one of them having his car torched - and police have yet to arrest any perpetrators.  Sirawith Seritiwat, 27, is an outspoken student activist well-known for staging anti-military protests but has been more subdued since the announcement of March's elections.  His mother told AFP he was attacked Friday morning outside his home, with witnesses telling her four men started beating her son with sticks.

Photos shared on social media showed Sirawith bloodied from the attack, with his eyes swollen.  It is the second attack on him this year, following a June 2 incident when five unidentified men pummelled him with sticks, briefly hospitalising him with several head wounds.  Sirawith filed a complaint but the police investigation has not yielded any arrests.  His mother believes it is ""the same group"" of attackers.  ""He had no enemies, only political ones. He has been campaigning against the junta for the past five years,"" Patnaree told AFP.  Two other prominent pro-democracy campaigners, Anurak Jeantawanich and Ekachai Hongkangwan, have also been publicly targeted this year.  Ekachai, a frequent critic of the military-led government, has been attacked nine times since 2018 and his car was set on fire in two separate incidents this year.  Anon Chawalawan of iLaw, a legal monitoring group, said police have not arrested any suspects over this year's attacks against the three activists.  Human Rights Watch (HRW) has repeatedly called on authorities to investigate the incidents, and has raised concerns about possible government involvement.  HRW's Sunai Phasuk said the three activists were ""seen as enemies of the junta"" for their peaceful opposition.  ""The climate of fear (for activists) is very real and the threat, including physical threats, has become imminent.""",en,terrorattack,,

Turkey supports LibyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internationally recognised government in Tripoli which on Wednesday dealt a blow to eastern forces trying to seize the capital in a three-month campaign.  Any aircraft arriving from Turkey attempting to land in the capital Tripoli would be treated as hostile, said Mismari. The same would apply to Turkish ships docking at Libyan ports.  He also said his Libyan National Army (LNA) force would attack any Turkish military presence, without elaborating.  Turkey has supplied drones and trucks to forces allied to Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, while the LNA has received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, according to diplomats.  The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, has failed to take Tripoli but it commands air superiority. It has several times attacked TripoliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functioning airport.  Mismari also said his forces had lost 43 soldiers in the battle over the town of Gharyan which the Tripoli forces took on Wednesday.  Gharyan was the main forward base for the LNA where troops, weapons and ammunition arrived. The LNA began its Tripoli campaign there.  The LNA still holds the town of Tarhouna southeast of Tripoli, its second main position in the campaign.  Haftar and his backers say they are trying to free the capital from militias which they blame for destabilising Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.  HaftarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s critics accuse him of trying to seize power through force and deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and west of the sprawling North African country.  HaftarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offensive has upended United Nations-led plans to stabilise Libya after years of conflict that have left the oil-rich nation divided and caused living standards to plummet.  The conflict risks disrupting oil production, creating a vacuum to be exploited by militants and prompting more migrants to leave for Italy by boat.

The first drone targeted the province of Jizan and the second was aimed at a residential area in Asir province, the coalition said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency.  The coalition did not report any damage or casualties.  The rebels earlier claimed drone attacks on the airports in Jizan and Abha, the capital of Asir, according to the group's Al-Masirah TV.  The Iran-aligned Huthi rebels, who have faced persistent coalition bombing since March 2015 which has exacted a heavy civilian death toll, have stepped up missile and drone attacks across the border in recent weeks.  On June 12, a rebel missile attack on Abha airport wounded 26 civilians, drawing promises of stern action from the coalition.  And on June 23, another rebel attack on Abha airport killed a Syrian national and wounded 21 other civilians, according to the coalition.  The raids come amid heightened regional tensions after Washington - a key ally of Riyadh - accused Iran of shooting down a US drone over international waters and of carrying out attacks on oil tankers in the strategic Gulf of Oman.  Saudi Arabia has repeatedly accused Iran of supplying sophisticated weapons to Huthi rebels, a charge Teheran denies.  Following recent attacks, Saudi state media have reported an intensification of coalition air raids on rebel positions in the northern Yemeni province of Hajjah and the Huthi-held capital Sanaa.  The coalition intervened in support of the Yemeni government in 2015 when President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled into Saudi exile as the rebels closed in on his last remaining territory in and around the second city Aden.  Since then, the conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, many of them civilians, relief agencies say.  The fighting has triggered what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with millions of people displaced and in need of aid.",en,terrorattack,,

So when the long-awaited treatment became available, we were over the moon,"" says Ibrahim Nabih, 46, who lives in a village in the Egyptian Nile Delta.  His story is not unique - it's one of millions of ""small miracles"" achieved in the last few years after Egypt successfully implemented a massive campaign to detect and treat hepatitis C.  In 2016, the disease killed roughly 40,000 Egyptians and nearly five million others were infected according to the World Bank.  The road to controlling hepatitis C in Egypt has required years of government effort, supported by international institutions such as WHO, as well as local civil society organisations.  Now the pioneering scheme to provide free treatment to Egyptian nationals and foreign residents has become an inspirational model for the rest of the world.  The journey began in 2006 when Egypt founded the National Committee for Control of Viral Hepatitis (NCCVH).  Dr. Manal Hamdy El Sayed, a member of the NCCVH and a consultant to WHO, attributes the plan's success to political leadership and a highly experienced working group that includes the NCCVH, executives, information network managers, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, data entry personnel, volunteers, media and civil society.  In 2011, an integrated plan was put in place for diagnosis, prevention and cure. The number of treatment centres was increased to 26, so that there is always one within 50 km of a patient's home.  Related Story 20 ideas to build inclusive societies  The treatment centres have provided their services continuously for the last 13 years without a single day's closure, even during the revolution of 25 January 2011.  Formerly, patients were treated with the drug interferon, which had a success rate of only 50 percent and unpleasant side effects.  In 2014, the Egyptian government signed an agreement to procure the American medicine Sovaldi (Brand name of Sofosbuvir).  The drug would cost one percent of its international price as long as the Egyptian government bore the cost of treating patients for free and local companies manufactured a generic version in Egypt.  Studies show that the locally manufactured drug - the cheapest in the world - is no less effective than the imported one.  Dr Wahid Doss, President of the NCCVH, noted, ""The previous Minister of Health, Dr Adel Adawy, made great efforts to reduce the price of the medicine so that it now only costs EGP 800 for a course of treatment.""  He said that the pilot scheme's success is due in large part to the size of the problem and the spread of the virus in Egypt, which led to popular pressure on decision-makers to quickly find a solution.  Political leaders and successive health ministers have supported the NCCVH, which is fully independent and staffed by volunteers.  At the end of 2018, the government initiated its largest ever health-screening campaign for hepatitis C and non-communicable diseases.  Over 52 million Egyptians were screened in medical centres and in mobile units at workplaces and in the streets.  In the last five years, the new medicines have cured around 3 million Egyptian citizens of hepatitis C. Dr. Gamal Esmat, a member of the NCCVH, said that 2018 is considered to be the year when hepatitis C was nearly eliminated in Egypt.  As treatment has been offered to almost all Egyptians who need it, in 2019 President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered the government to extend the screening and provision of free treatment to include seven million refugees and foreign residents in Egypt.  As part of its current presidency of the African Union, Egypt is also providing hepatitis C screening and treatment to one million people in over 14 African countries.  Last April, an Egyptian delegation visited treatment centres in Somalia, Chad, Ethiopia and Sudan.  Whilst Egypt continues to be very successful at treating hepatitis C sufferers, experts agree that the biggest upcoming challenge will be to increase levels of prevention of the disease so as to preserve what has already been achieved.  This will be through combating bad practices in dealing with blood and improving procedures for preventing infection in hospitals.",en,diseas,,

(AP file photo)  HANOI: Vietnam said on Tuesday it has had initial success in creating a vaccine to fight African swine fever, which has infected farms throughout the Southeast Asian country and prompted the culling of around 10% of its pig herd.  African swine fever - which has spread to Laos and North Korea as well after being detected in China in August 2018 - was first detected in Vietnam in February and has spread to farms in 61 of the country's 63 provinces.  More than 2.9 million pigs have been culled in Vietnam, Agriculture Minister Nguyen Xuan Cuong said on Tuesday, out of a hog population of about 30 million.  ""I think we're on the right track, and we will soon have a vaccine,"" Cuong said, according to the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA).  The vaccine, developed at the Vietnam National University of Agriculture, has been tested in its laboratory and at three farms in northern Vietnam, state broadcaster Vietnam Television (VTV) said in a separate report on Tuesday.  Experts on vaccines and African swine fever, though, were sceptical over the claims of progress and said there needed to be much more research to prove the viability of any vaccine.  ""We need different phases of clinical trials, first in an experimental setting with controlled exposure, and then a field trial with natural exposure to the virus, and that cannot be a small trial,"" said Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at the City University of Hong Kong.  The complex nature of the virus and gaps in knowledge concerning infection and immunity have so far hindered other global efforts to develop a vaccine against the disease, which is harmless to humans but deadly to pigs.  Researchers elsewhere have abandoned attempts to use a killed virus for a vaccine and teams in the United States, Europe and China have been working on live vaccines instead, which carry higher safety risks.  In Vietnam's initial trials, 31 out of 33 pigs injected with the test vaccine are still healthy after receiving two shots over a period of months, according to the VTV report.  Other pigs at the farms have died from the virus, the report said, without giving specific figures. No further details were given about the vaccine or the trials.  The agricultural university's director, Nguyen Thi Lan, said the vaccine still needed further research, and required testing on a larger scale.  Lan declined to comment on the report and referred questions from Reuters to the agricultural ministry, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Pork makes up three-quarters of total meat consumption in Vietnam, a country of 95 million people where most of its farm-raised pigs are consumed domestically.  The country's pork industry is valued at 94 trillion dong ($4 billion) a year, and accounts for nearly 10% of Vietnam's agricultural sector.  African swine fever was first detected in Asia last year in China, the world's largest pork producer. As many as half of China's breeding pigs have died or been slaughtered because of the disease, twice as many as officially reported.",en,diseas,,

African swine fever is deadly to pigs and there is no cure or vaccine for the disease, which has swept across China, the world's top pork producer, since August last year.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Asked about reports of recent fresh outbreaks of swine fever, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Yu Kangzhen said China had seen only 44 new cases in the first six months of 2019.  That brings the total number of cases China has reported since the first one in August 2018 to 143, with 1.16 million pigs culled, Yu told reporters at a briefing on Thursday.  However, many outbreaks are not being reported, farmers have told Reuters, with local officials in some provinces unwilling to verify the disease.  Reuters reported this week that as many as half of China's breeding pigs have died from African swine fever or been slaughtered because of the spreading disease, twice as many as had been officially acknowledged.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Yu said the government is currently checking online reports of alleged outbreaks of the disease, adding that any party not reporting a case would be severely punished.  ""Our attitude is very clear: when it comes to under-reporting of the disease, though we can't guarantee zero cases [are not reported], we will definitely have zero tolerance for it,"" he said.  Some talk of cases turned out to be rumours after official checks, he said.  But he said there were still challenges in controlling the spread of the fever. Feeding kitchen waste to pigs is banned, for example, but is still taking place, Yu said.  The virus can remain in meat that has not been properly cooked, potentially infecting pigs that eat food scraps.  The capability of China's many small farmers to prevent the disease is also weak, he said, and areas with many outbreaks tend to be places where there are not enough people and money to prevent and control it.  Yu's comments came after China's cabinet issued new guidelines on strengthening measures to prevent and control the disease, warning that there were shortcomings in China's efforts and that the situation remained severe.  China's State Council said management of transporting live hogs is not strict enough and there is insufficient capacity in testing for the African swine fever virus in slaughtering plants. It also urged stricter handling of kitchen scraps.  The disease will leave China with a ""tight balance"" in pig supplies, said Yu, adding that imports, including from the United States, would help adjust supplies.  Others have warned of a looming shortage of millions of tonnes of pork.  VACCINE AT EARLY STAGES  Yu also warned that research and development of a vaccine to prevent swine fever is only in early stages and faced lots of challenges and technical bottlenecks.  He declined to comment on a timeline for the likely launch of a Chinese-made vaccine.  Chinese state media reported in May that government researchers were ready to start clinical trials on a vaccine after identifying suitable candidates.  Yu said research institutes have set up partnerships with major vaccine producers in China, but that developing a safe and effective vaccine was an ""austere task"".",en,diseas,,

A sustained week-long aerial attack on cities in southern Idlib province has caused the most civilian casualties since Russian jets joined the Syrian army on April 26 in the offensive to recapture the enclave.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is the heaviest bombing and loss of life since the start of the campaign,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Fadel Abdul Ghany, chairman of the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR).  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are taking revenge on our popular support that has stood by us,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Naji Mustafa, spokesman for the Turkey-backed National Liberation Front (NLF) coalition of insurgent groups. He described the raids as Ã¢â‚¬Å“systematic terror by the (President Bashar al-) Assad gangs and Russian forces.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Both the Syrian government and its Russian ally, whose air power has been critical to military gains by Damascus in recent years, deny targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure.  They say their offensive Ã¢â‚¬â€ one of the biggest of the eight-year-old conflict Ã¢â‚¬â€ is intended to end the rule of al Qaeda militants over the northwest.  On Monday jets killed four civilians and wounded scores in a raid on a marketplace in Maarat al-Numan city in the same place where 40 people were killed on July 22 in the single deadliest strike since the campaign began. [L8N24N21B]  The attack followed two days of heavy bombing of the centre of Ariha city in which at least 16 civilians were killed, rescuers said.  In all, more than 62 people were killed in four major raids on the cities of Maarat al Numan, Ariha, and several towns since last week, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) which documents casualties and briefs various U.N. agencies.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“MOUNTING CIVILIAN CASUALTIESÃ¢â‚¬Â  U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Friday denounced the Ã¢â‚¬Å“apparent international indifferenceÃ¢â‚¬Â to the mounting civilian casualties.  Rebels say the campaign has now shifted significantly towards cities and urban centres and away from mainly rural and sparsely populated towns and villages near the frontline.  The heavy bombing of rural villages has so far displaced 440,000 people, who have headed to the safety of areas closer to the border with Turkey, the latest U.N. estimate shows.  The pattern of the latest bombing echoes the relentless strikes that enabled the government to win back former rebel held bastions around the capital last year, rebels said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening now is that ... they are targeting areas that are crowded with people,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mohammad Rashid, a rebel official from the mainstream Jaish al Nasr faction.  Rebel commanders expect bombing civilian populations will become a more pressing military priority to crush insurgents, as Russia and its allies become increasingly mired in a campaign that has been costly, with no significant territorial gains.  U.N. officials and aid workers have said a humanitarian disaster could unfold if the strikes expand to Idlib city and other cities that have so far been spared sustained bombing.  A majority of the three to four million people who live in the opposition enclave are in these urban centres and aid workers say wider strikes bring the prospect of a major new refugee exodus along the border with Turkey.

3160964,bbci,Bbc News M Ilyas Khan,Kargil: The forgotten victims of the world's highest war,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49101016,,31/7/2019 20:18,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The fighting left hundreds of casualties on both sides of the Line of Control that divides Kashmir  The war began soon after Zainab Bibi was married in the spring of 1999.  ""We were at home and it was night time, around 8pm. We saw shells exploding on the mountaintops, so we rushed to the cave bunkers.""  Zainab's village, Ganokh, found itself in the firing line between India and Pakistan, high in the Himalayas. It's on the Pakistani side of a ceasefire line dividing Kashmir, which both countries claim.  Twenty years ago, a tactical operation ordered secretly by Pakistan's generals to occupy heights in Kargil on the Indian side flared into a war they hadn't expected. It led to defeat and embarrassment, and triggered events that culminated in the country's third military coup in 50 years.  Thousands of civilians from Zainab's village and others nearby lost their homes and livelihoods in the conflict. Similar numbers were displaced on the Indian side, but they were able to return after the war.  On the Pakistani side, however, official promises of help in the aftermath of the war never materialised, and many continue to struggle in refugee slums around the country.  Image caption Zainab Bibi (left) was forced to flee the fighting as a teenager  Zainab says after the first night, the shelling intensified for several days. Soon people she knew were dying.  A shell landed where her grandfather was watering his barley crop above the village, killing him on the spot. Another shell hit a rooftop in the village below, killing two teenage boys sitting in the sun.  As fear spread, army personnel stationed in the area asked the villagers to leave.  ""They didn't say where, or how. We were on our own,"" Zainab, who is now 33, tells the BBC in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, where she ended up living. ""We picked up some quilts and utensils, and squeezed into a truck crammed with our neighbours. We left our yaks, cows and goats to the care of God.""  They headed for Skardu, some 150km (90 miles) north. They lived there for two months, in a shack offered by a local, until Pakistan announced a ceasefire and ordered its troops to withdraw from the peaks they had occupied on the Indian side.  Image caption Many locals ended up in Skardu, where they are still living in refugee settlements  ""When the war ended, many people were in two minds about what to do. One of our neighbours who visited our village said most houses were damaged, orchards destroyed and much of the livestock either killed or lost,"" Zainab recalls.  ""So my husband decided that we should head to Islamabad where a friend told him he could find work.""  Ghulam Mohammad, who's from the same valley as Zainab, made a similar decision to flee. He was in his late teens when hostilities broke out and he had to leave his apricot trees and livestock behind in his village, Hargosel.  His parents had already died and he had no siblings so he and other relatives left the village and ended up in Skardu, which had become ""crammed with people fleeing the war"", he recalls.  ""Some people had put up tents in the desert outside the town. Others didn't even have that. It was a sad sight.""  Young and lonely, he left the area and went to work in Karachi, a city at the other end of the country.  Zainab Bibi and Ghulam Mohammad come from Kharmang, a valley in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, which shares a border with Kargil on the Indian side.  Once connected to the Buddhist Ladakh region of what is now Indian-administered Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan fell on the Pakistani side during the partition of British India in 1947.  However, the area was treated as part of disputed Kashmir under a United Nations resolution passed in 1948.  Pakistan's powerful military tried on at least two occasions - 1947 and 1965 - to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule. On both occasions it publicly denied its direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.  Image copyright EPA Image caption Pakistan publicly denies its soldiers played a direct role in rebellions against Indian rule in Kashmir  The Kargil war began in a similar fashion.  Thousands of regulars of the paramilitary Northern Light Infantry, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude warfare, were sent in over the winter to occupy military posts the Indians used to vacate in the months of snow.  They established positions on heights ranging from 16,000 to 18,000 feet above sea level. These commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route to troops stationed at Siachen glacier, the world's highest battlefield, which the Indians occupied in 1984.  When the Indians detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan said they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.  Observers say the Pakistani aim was to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms.  They say that given Pakistan's nuclear test less than a year earlier, its generals were hoping the Indian response would be muted due to the threat of a nuclear war.  Image copyright The India Today Group Image caption India regained Kargil within weeks  But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support, thereby turning it into the first full-blooded military conflict between the two countries since the 1971 war that saw the birth of Bangladesh.  By mid-June, the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall, and there were international calls for Pakistan to withdraw.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes on the Indian side too  There is evidence to suggest the Pakistani military leadership had hidden details of the Kargil operation from the government of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. On 4 July he was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His government was toppled in a military coup two months later.  India had fully retaken the Kargil heights by 26 July. It lost more than 500 men in the war, while estimates for Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000.  As for those made homeless by the conflict, thousands remain displaced in Pakistan to this day, still waiting for help.  About 20,000 people from the Kharmang valley had to leave their villages. Twenty years on this displaced population has doubled - and 70% have not returned.  Image copyright EPA Image caption India remembered its dead from the Kargil conflict earlier this week  ""This is mainly due to the absence of any government-led rehabilitation programme, or because their lands have been taken over by the army,"" says Wazir Farman, a Skardu-based lawyer and member of the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).  Three villages closest to the frontline - Gangani, Brolmo and Badigam Bresel - were completely destroyed during the fighting.  Bu-Ali Rizwani, an elder from Brolmo who lives in a refugee colony in Skardu, says the villages remain a no-go area for locals because the military has set up barracks and bunkers in them.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption India and Pakistan's 'war-mongering' media  Protests by the villagers in Skardu in 2003 and 2004 forced the district administration to set up a team including military officials to carry out a survey of their losses. In 2010, a compensation package of 110m rupees (about $680k; Ã‚Â£550k) was worked out for the three villages, but the money has not been paid.  ""We held meetings with the army force commander in Skardu, with the chief minister in Gilgit, we travelled to Islamabad to discuss the issue with officials of the ministries of defence and Kashmir affairs,"" Mr Rizwani says.  ""The army told us the government would pay. The Kashmir ministry said the Gilgit-Baltistan government would pay. It said the army would pay. We chased the matter until 2012, and then we gave up.""  In Gultari region, the military has been delaying payment of a much smaller amount of about 1.9m rupees to residents whose land it acquired to build a jeep track to its forward posts in 1999. The delay has come despite a 2010 court ruling in favour of the landowners.  When contacted, a senior official in the Gilgit-Baltistan government said it was a matter for the military to answer.  The BBC contacted the Pakistani military, which said it would check the details of the cases. It did not provide a response in time for publication. It also provided no comment on the claim that the military's covert operation in Kargil was hidden from the civilian government.  It's no surprise to find that locals whose lives were changed forever by the Kargil war feel they have been abandoned.  About half a dozen families returned to Hargosel, but Ghulam Mohammad's is not among them.  Image caption Ghulam Mohammad (left) and Fida Hussain (centre) fled the village of Hargosel  ""I haven't had the money to repair my house which was damaged during the war,"" he says. ""Also, the land has turned barren, and since most of my close neighbours haven't returned, there won't be farmhands available to make it cultivable.""  Besides, the land above Hargosel is strewn with landmines and unexploded bombs, so animal grazing is a risky business. ""Two boys were injured last year when they stepped on a bomb,"" Ghulam Mohammad says.  He moved back to Skardu, where he got married in 2004. The BBC spoke to him in Rawalpindi, where he is receiving medical treatment.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Much of the Kargil area is snowbound for half of the year  Zainab Bibi has other reasons for not going back to her village, though her parents and some of her in-laws have returned.  Over the years she and her husband worked and saved enough money to buy a small hut of their own in an Islamabad slum. Their four children are at school in the capital.  ""We have lived a hard life, but everything happened for the best, and I thank God for that,"" she says.  And she doesn't want to go back.  ""As a child in my village, I grazed goats and tended our barley crops. I sometimes miss Ganokh, but my children belong in Islamabad, and this is where we're staying.""",en,terrorattack,,

The attack at the office and hotel complex, orchestrated by at least five al-Shabab-linked assailants, killed 21 people and wounded many others on January 15, echoing a 2013 assault on an up-market shopping centre in the capital.  In a show of resilience, the DusitD2 complex reopened on Wednesday with staff at most of the local and foreign firms housed there shrugging off concerns to go back to work amid tightened security.  But some are not going back.  Roselyne Chilande, 35, a supervisor at a parking ticket firm serving the 14 Riverside Drive complex, who was shot in the leg during the attack, said she cannot return as it brings back bad memories.  ""Dusit? No, I can't go back there,"" Chilande told Al Jazeera at her one-roomed house in the Kawangware informal settlement on the outskirts of Nairobi, which she shares with her three-year-old son and niece who has a similar-aged boy.  ""There is a day I went back to pick up my belongings from the office and heard car alarms go off. My heart almost stopped. If I go back there I will be scared all the time.""  She said her job at KAPS Limited had been kept open and continued paying her salary and helped settle her medical bills.  Roselyne Chilande, who was shot in the leg, is still traumatised by the attack [Kevin Mwanza/Al Jazeera]  Hardest hit  Regional tech firm Cellulant, which was hardest hit by the attack by losing six of its staff, is in the process of getting a new office elsewhere in the city, a source who did not wish to be named said.  But for others, business had to continue at 14 Riverside Drive after the bloody siege.  ""Initially, there was a lot of shock and trauma. Real trauma,"" said Washington Akumu, a communication consultant at a public relations firm based in the complex.  ""Coming back to 14 [Riverside Drive] wasn't easy but it had to be done, for business continuity and also for the bigger cause of not letting terror and its merchants win.""  A quick end to the DusitD2 Hotel attack was lauded by authorities and security experts as an improvement in Kenya's counterterrorism measures since Somalia-based al-Shabab fighters overran Nairobi's Westgate Mall killing 67 people five years ago, and ambushed Garissa University killing 148 students in 2015.  Kenya, a hub for multinationals and the United Nations, became a target of al-Shabab after it sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to create a buffer zone along its long porous border.  At least 300 people have been killed in Kenya in about 20 attacks linked to al-Shabab since Kenya's army crossed the border to join the African Union Mission in Somalia's fight against the armed group.  Mwenda Mbijiwe, a Nairobi-based security analyst, said the reopening of DusitD2 Hotel was a show of resilience from the city and ""the ability of the nation to rise from defeat"".  ""That Dusit [goes] back to business shows our ability to reincarnate,"" Mbijiwe told Al Jazeera.  ""All these attacks show that the terrorists are not to be underestimated. They will keep trying. We need to close loopholes that these terrorists use to hit us.""  Kenya's government has proposed a number of security measures, including the introduction of new identification numbers, arming private security guards, establishing counterterrorism training in schools, and beefing up intelligence, Mbijiwe said.  The country is also struggling with the involvement of ""home-grown"" attackers who are not Somali and easily infiltrate communities without raising suspicion.  However, even with these new security measures, victims such as Chilande still find it hard to return to 14 Riverside Drive.  ""For those going back, I tell them to take heart and do their job without fear,"" she said. ""They say lightning doesn't strike the same place twice. So I hope it doesn't happen again.""",en,terrorattack,,

But he said it was ""too early"" to clearly tie them with the rebellion.

3179529,straitstimes,None,"US faces challenges in stopping domestic terrorism, United States News & Top Stories",http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-faces-challenges-in-stopping-domestic-terrorism,7/8/2019 5:00,7/8/2019 12:23,"WASHINGTON Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Following two mass shootings at the weekend, US President Donald Trump on Monday called on the federal authorities to do a better job identifying violent extremists in the US.  But that will not be easy.  Federal investigators looking to prevent acts of domestic terrorism, like the massacre of 22 people at a shopping centre in El Paso last Saturday, have fewer tools and authorities at their disposal than they would if they were up against someone tied to an international organisation such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Al-Qaeda.  That challenge has revived questions about whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which transformed itself after the Sept 11 attacks to combat international terrorism and acquired broad new surveillance powers, is adequately positioned to confront a white nationalist threat responsible for some of the deadliest acts of violence in the last few years.  Former FBI counterterrorism supervisor David Gomez said: ""I can go online and say whatever I want, but that doesn't mean it's sufficient for the FBI to open an investigation. You need to combine the free speech with an overt act, and that overt act has to be something criminal in nature.""  The laws, as they exist, ""are not designed around the FBI being able to prevent these actions"", Mr Gomez added. ""The laws are designed to respond to crimes already committed and then investigate them.""  Confronting domestic terrorism is an urgent issue for law enforcement at a time when white supremacists and like-minded extremists are causing more murders - including a rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October that killed 11 people - than Americans inspired by foreign groups.  The FBI made about 90 domestic terrorism arrests in the first three-quarters of the year and has hundreds of open cases.  Still, Mr Trump said law enforcement ""must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs"".  ""I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local, state and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike,"" the President said.  That is easier said than done, with part of the challenge arising from how federal law distinguishes between international terrorism and domestic terrorism.  The authorities conducting international terrorism investigations, for instance, can get a secret surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of a person they think may be an agent of a foreign power or terror group.  Similarly, the United States criminal code makes it a crime for anyone to lend material support to designated foreign terror organisations, including ISIS and Al-Qaeda, even if the accusation does not involve accusations of violence.  There is no domestic counterpart to that material support statute, meaning federal prosecutors must use weapon laws, hate crime laws and other approaches. Mere membership in, or support for, a white supremacist organisation is not illegal.  And decades after accusations of surveillance abuses in the era of former director J. Edgar Hoover, FBI officials consider themselves duty-bound to follow internal guidelines meant to respect free speech.  Other obstacles include whether technology companies can adequately flag troublesome behaviour in advance, and whether law enforcement can successfully separate out those bent on violence from those who simply mouth off about it.  The perpetrators of extremist attacks often act by themselves without any affiliation to a broader movement or organisation, which can thwart efforts to identify them beforehand.

Department of Health-Bicol director Ernie Vera said 4,241 dengue cases were recorded for the first 7 months of the year in he region, and that most of those who died were children aged 4 months to 10 years old.  Vera said the spike in dengue cases in the country could have been avoided if local officials only strictly enforced the government's anti-dengue strategy, with the help of local communities.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This year, the Philippines is experiencing massive mosquito-borne disease because the public and some local government units failed to enforce and maintain cleanliness in their respective localities despite of our plea,Ã¢â‚¬Â Vera said.  Vera said that as early as January, the health department had been calling on the public and local government units to enforce the ""4S strategy"" to help stem dengue cases, especially in view of extreme weather events due to climate change.  The strategy includes destroying mosquito breeding place, self-protective measures like wearing long sleeves and use of insect repellent, early consultation on the first signs and symptoms of the disease, and fogging if there is an impending outbreak.  Figures only from sentinel site  The regional health chief said the actual number of dengue cases in the Bicol could be higher, as the 4,241 cases reported to the DOH was just taken from the lone sentinel site in the region, the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital (BRTTH).  The DOH on Tuesday, August 6, declared a national dengue epidemic as cases of the disease went up by 98% compared to the same 7-month period last year.  Vera said that it was just the second time that the Philippines experienced a dengue outbreak. The first was in 1998.  Among the 6 provinces of Bicol, Camarines Sur had the highest number of cases with 17 deaths and 1,706 cases in the first 7 months of the year, followed by Albay with 10 deaths and 769 cases, Sorsogon with 8 deaths and 784 cases, Catanduanes with 1 death and 563 cases, Masbate with 2 deaths and 271 cases, and Camarines Norte, 2 deaths and 144 cases.  Bicol is one of the 7 regions in the country that exceeded the dengue epidemic threshold for the past 3 consecutive weeks.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœSustained community effortÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  Vera appealed to all stakeholders for sustained community efforts to fight dengue in homes, workplaces, and schools.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our aim is to cut the cycle of mosquito borne disease and this could be done through collective efforts and institutionalization of anti-dengue drive campaign of the local government units,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  He called on governors, mayors and local councils to enact local ordinances that would strengthen the fight against mosquito-borne disease and related emerging infectious diseases in Bicol.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We enjoin all respective government agencies, LGUs, schools private offices and entire Bicolanos to conduct the simultaneous 4 oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock habit para Deng-get Out. Let us all together fight the bite to destroy breeding sites of mosquitos,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  The Philippines has recorded the most number of dengue cases in Southeast Asia so far in 2019, with 146,062 cases and 622 deaths due to the mosquito-borne disease from January 1 to July 23, 2019.Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,diseas,,

The Israeli forces raided the nearby Palestinian village of Beit Fajar, a mile south of where the body was found. Soldiers blocked the road and searched homes.

Kyrgyz former President Almazbek Atambayev, who was stripped of legal immunity after a parliamentary vote, and his supporters attend a meeting with journalists in the village of Koy-Tash near Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan June 27, 2019. REUTERS/Vladimir Pirogov - RC135AE84FD0  A video posted online by an Atambayev supporter showed several cars being driven out of the former presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s country house by security officials after what his party described as his surrender. One of AtambayevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aides is visible inside one car saying it was headed to the interior ministry.  President Sooronbai Jeenbekov said Atambayev, originally wanted for questioning as a witness in an investigation, was now wanted for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“grave crimeÃ¢â‚¬Â after the violent standoff the previous day.  The confrontation between Jeenbekov and his former patron and predecessor risks destabilising the Central Asian nation which hosts a Russian military airbase and is a major centre for gold mining.  During the previous dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s botched raid, one member of the security forces was killed and six others were captured by AtambayevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followers, the authorities said.  Jeenbekov ordered unspecified Ã¢â‚¬Å“urgent measuresÃ¢â‚¬Â on Thursday to maintain the rule of law.  Atambayev, who helped Jeenbekov to power in 2017 but whose relationship with the president then soured, says corruption allegations against him are politically motivated.  Atambayev and his supporters initially announced plans on Thursday to rally in Bishkek and march towards the building which houses both parliament and the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office. But Atambayev did not show up and remained holed up in a village near Bishkek.  Local media reported sounds of gunfire and stun grenades going off at the site when security forces launched a second raid on Thursday.  A video posted by news website Kaktus.media showed Deputy Interior Minister Kursan Asanov, wearing a bulletproof vest, negotiating the terms of AtambayevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surrender. Asanov can be heard offering to let Atambayev bring his bodyguards with him in a car out of the compound.  AtambayevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lawyer, Sergei Slesarev, told Reuters his client was now in custody and his case would be investigated by police.  Parliament stripped Atambayev of immunity from prosecution in June, accusing him of corruption.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unfortunately, the authorities have not listened to my calls to act legally,Ã¢â‚¬Â Atambayev said in a video address posted online.  Kyrgyzstan has been politically volatile: presidents were deposed by uprisings in 2005 and 2010. Atambayev, who took part in both revolts, helped to ensure a smooth succession and hoped to retain influence by installing then-ally Jeenbekov as successor in 2017. But within months, Jeenbekov purged Atambayev loyalists from the cabinet.  Late last month, Atambayev visited Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin expressed support for Jeenbekov in a statement made after the meeting.  Indicating it expected the situation to stabilise, the Kyrgyz government pressed ahead with plans to host a meeting of prime ministers from several ex-Soviet nations including Russia on Friday. Kazakh Prime Minister Askar Mamin has already arrived in the resort town of Cholpon-Ata, it said.

Afghan commanders vowed last year to take the offensive, rather than go on fighting a static Ã¢â‚¬Å“checkpoint war.Ã¢â‚¬Â But in most major battlegrounds, the bulk of the regular Afghan forces are still holed up in fortified bases and outposts. Most offensive operations have been left to small numbers of Afghan and American Special Operations soldiers, backed by both countriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ air forces.  The woeful state of the regular Afghan forces has been widely seen as giving the Taliban a valuable edge in its negotiations with the United States, which have gone on for eight rounds in Doha, Qatar, and are believed to be near a conclusion. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday but also may be delayed, perhaps for weeks.  An analysis of more than 2,300 combat deaths of government forces, compiled in daily casualty reports by The New York Times from January through July, found that more than 87 percent occurred during Taliban attacks on bases, checkpoints or command centers.

Cited by the official Saudi Press Agency, he said a drone launched by the Houthis from the Yemeni capital Sanaa ""fell"" over a residential area in Amran, a province controlled by the group just north of Sanaa.  Neither side reported any casualties.  The Houthis, who control Sanaa and most of Yemen's other populous areas, have stepped up attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia in recent months. In response, the Saudi-led coalition has targeted military sites belonging to the group, especially around Sanaa.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The attacks are complicating UN-led peace efforts.  The Western-backed Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore a Yemeni government ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis.

Yet, under Indian legislation, he was seen as a ""quack"" because he does not have a recognised medical degree that authorises him to practise modern medicine - and even risked prosecution.  Last week, however, he finally shed this label after the Indian government legislated the National Medical Commission Act giving individuals like Mr Sheikh the licence to practise medicine as community health providers (CHPs).  They will be allowed to prescribe medicine independently for primary and preventive healthcare.  CHPs will also be allowed to intervene in advanced cases under the supervision of registered medical practitioners. However, the number of such licences issued will not exceed a third of that for registered medical practitioners in India.  The government also disbanded the Medical Council of India in a wider attempt to overhaul medical education and care in the country.  The council held that no person other than a doctor recognised by and registered with it (or any of the state medical councils) is allowed to practise modern medicine.  This volte-face was prompted by some inconvenient facts.  India has one registered doctor for every 1,456 individuals, compared with the World Health Organisation's recommended ratio of one for every 1,000 individuals. Nearly four out of five doctors are based in urban areas.  India's network of around 26,000 public healthcare centres are under-resourced - around 60 per cent function with just one doctor instead of the recommended three.  Without doctors, village residents depend on quacks for affordable and accessible healthcare.  It is estimated that 1.5 million untrained providers offer more than 70 per cent of primary care in rural India. It may have been illegal but the arrangement flourished.  Dr Harsh Vardhan, the Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, justified the recent move as a step that would help the government attain universal health coverage.  ""Doctors are a scarce resource in our country and need to be optimally utilised,"" he said. ""They are indispensable for secondary and tertiary care; the only area where other health professionals can supplement them is preventive and primary healthcare.""  Dr Partha Sarathi Mukherjee, director of Liver Foundation, West Bengal, a not-for-profit group based in Kolkata, said the move to engage these health workers is a belated recognition of the poor state of healthcare in remote India.  ""The rural population has been suffering for many, many years because of the absence of not only quality healthcare but also primary and preventive healthcare,"" Dr Mukherjee told The Straits Times. ""The government now must properly train and monitor these workers, who are currently self-trained and self-regulated.""  Recognising the vital role such workers play, the Liver Foundation, West Bengal has been working since 2007 to formalise their role and fold them into the healthcare delivery system by training them to respond to primary health concerns. It has trained around 3,800, including Mr Sheikh, in the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand.

The positive impact that health workers like him have had has also been validated by a study published in Science journal in 2016.  It found that those trained by Liver Foundation, West Bengal had increased the rate of correct case management by 7.9 percentage points and the likelihood of providing ""average-quality or higher"" treatment by 6.2 points.  But Delhi's move has faced opposition, with doctors at hospitals stopping work in protest. Dr R. N. Tandon, honorary secretary-general of the Indian Medical Association until last November, said it would create ""legalised quacks"" and harm public health.  ""The government should instead be improving rural healthcare infrastructure so that doctors are encouraged to go and practise there,"" he told ST. ""One cannot divide India into two communities, one to be treated by untrained people and the other by qualified doctors.""  Dr Vardhan dismissed concerns that this move would encourage quacks by arguing that the punishment for quackery has been enhanced, with offenders facing imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of 500,000 rupees (S$9,700).  ""The so-called quacks in the country do not possess any qualifications and would not be able to meet the conditions that will be set by National Medical Commission for becoming a CHP,"" he said.",en,diseas,,

IS claimed responsibility for a weekend bomb attack on a wedding reception in the capital, Kabul, that killed 63 people and wounded nearly 200.  The Jalalabad bombs were planted near a market where hundreds of people had congregated after attending Independence Day events. Senior health official Fahim Bashari said at least 66 people were wounded, including 20 children enjoying the public holiday.  Ghulam Mohammad, a shopkeeper selling plants, said his two sons and a nephew were among the injured in a blast at the market square.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Children insisted on being in the shop, as they wanted to celebrate Independence Day in the market, but they were seriously injured when a bomb exploded,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mohammad said at a hospital in the city.  Independence day ceremonies were disrupted in Mehtralam, the capital of the eastern province of Laghman, when militants hit a celebration venue with five rockets, officials said, adding that six civilians were injured.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Taliban have laid the foundation for such brutal killings.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In the speech, Ghani did not refer to negotiations between the United States and the Taliban on a deal by which U.S. troops can withdraw in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.  The United States also wants a Taliban commitment on power-sharing talks with GhaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government and a ceasefire. The Taliban have refused to talk to the government.  But there are concerns among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides about a U.S. withdrawal, with fears Afghanistan could be plunged into a new civil war that could herald a return of Taliban rule and international militants, including Islamic State, finding a refuge.  U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan before the 2020 presidential election.  Trump on Sunday called the Kabul bomb attack horrible and expressed optimism about the talks.  He said the United States would seek to get troop levels below 13,000 but leave behind Ã¢â‚¬Å“very significantÃ¢â‚¬Â intelligence capabilities.

""Our struggle will continue against (ISIS), we will take revenge and will root them out,"" Mr Ghani declared. He added that safe havens for militants are across the border in Pakistan, whose intelligence service has long been accused of supporting the Taleban. The ISIS affiliate, in claiming the wedding attack, said it was carried out by a Pakistani fighter.  Following the attack, many outraged Afghans are asking whether an approaching deal between the United States and the Taleban to end nearly 18 years of fighting will bring peace to the country.  The Taleban, which wants US and allied forces to withdraw from the country, in a sharply worded statement questioned why the US had failed to identify last Saturday's attacker in advance.  But Mr Ghani yesterday asserted that the Taleban is just as much to blame for the wedding attack, saying that the group had ""created the platform for terrorists"" with its own brutal assaults on public places over the years.

But earlier this month the so-called Security Belt militia, of the pro-secession Southern Transitional Council (STC), broke with the government and seized its temporary base of Aden. The United Nations said at least 40 people were killed in several days of fighting in Aden, which has functioned as the seat of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government.  Amid escalating tensions, the Security Belt on Tuesday overran a military camp belonging to the government's special forces in Zinjibar, about 60km east of Aden in Abyan province, and deployed across much of the city, unidentified officials and residents told The Associated Press news agency. The clashes killed at least three civilians and wounded nine, AP reported.  Separately, Abyan Governor Abu Bakr Hussein told AFP news agency that the separatists had also seized a nearby military camp at Al-Kawd, forcing out the 350 troops there.  At least four military personnel - two separatists and two government troops - were killed and 23 wounded in the fighting, Hussein said, adding that 1,100 troops had been stationed in Zinjibar.  'Unjustified escalation'  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is Saudi Arabia's main partner in the military coalition against the Houthis, but it has trained and equipped the separatists.  Analysts say the rising tensions between the separatists and the internationally recognised government reflects a wider rift between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh and complicates UN peace efforts in war-ravaged Yemen.  Yemen's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad al-Hadhrami said the latest flare-up in Abyan would undermine peace talks.  ""What Abyan governorate is witnessing is an unjustified escalation by the STC,"" the Yemeni foreign ministry quoted him as saying.  ""It is something that is rejected and unacceptable and will undermine mediation efforts by Saudi Arabia,"" he added, referring to a delegation sent by Riyadh to Aden to discuss the new front in the war.  Al-Hadhrami also called for an ""immediate and complete halt of the military and financial support"" by the UAE to the separatists.  Nizar Haitham, STC spokesman, said the council was open to dialogue but ruled out any withdrawal from the military posts in Aden.  ""There will be no dialogue if we were to hand over all the positions ... what will there be left to negotiate,"" he said in remarks published by the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat on Tuesday.  In a statement to the UN Security Council before a Yemen briefing on Tuesday in New York, the STC said it was holding firm to demands for self-rule in the south and to be included in any UN-sponsored talks on Yemen's future.  ""For too long the southern voice has been excluded from any negotiation table,"" the STC said.  ""The onus is now on the international community, and in particular the UN Security Council to accept the new realities on the ground.""  South Yemen was a separate state until it merged with the north in 1990. Four years later, an armed secession bid failed to reverse the reunification.  The UN's Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths said told the UN Security Council that there is ""no time to lose"" in brokering a peace deal to bring the fighting to a close.  ""The fragmentation of Yemen is becoming a stronger and more pressing threat,"" the British diplomat said via videolink from Jordan on Tuesday.    ""The stakes are becoming too high for the future of Yemen, the Yemeni people and the wider region. Yemen cannot wait,"" he continued.  ""No country can tolerate the stresses of internal conflict indefinitely,"" he added, saying the war must be brought to an end ""swiftly and peacefully.""  Griffiths also said he had held a ""positive and engaging"" meeting with Saudi's deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, on Monday to discuss the crisis.  ""Tireless role under Khalid bin Salman's leadership to restore order and stability in south Yemen,"" he tweeted. ""We agreed on the need for continuous dialogue.""  Yemen's long-running war has triggered what the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 24.1 million - more than two-thirds of the population - in need of aid. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions forced from their homes.",en,terrorattack,,

FILE PHOTO: With a painting of George Washington in the background, U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during his meeting with Romania's President Klaus Iohannis in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S. August 20, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo  Earlier this year, U.S.-backed forces reclaimed the last remaining territory once held by Islamic State militants in Syria. Since then, however, there has been concern about the militant group gaining new strength in Iraq and Syria.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“At a certain point Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have to fight their battles,Ã¢â‚¬Â Trump told reporters at the White House, later saying India should also get involved.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“All of these other countries where ISIS is around ... all of these are going to have to fight,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, adding that the United States did not want to spend Ã¢â‚¬Å“another 19 yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â fighting the Afghan war.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged on Tuesday that Islamic State militants were gaining strength in some areas but said the militant groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capacity to conduct attacks has been greatly diminished.  The State Department, also on Tuesday, offered a reward of up to $5 million each for information leading to the location of ISIS leaders it identified as Muhammad Abdal-Rahman al-Mawla, Sami Jasim Muhammad al-Jaburi, and Mutaz Numan Abd Nayif Najm al-Jaburi.  In Afghanistan, a deal between the Taliban and the United States for U.S. forces to withdraw could drive some die-hard Taliban fighters into the arms of Islamic State, Afghan officials and militants say.  Reuters reported on Aug. 16 that Western intermediaries have been trying to persuade Iran and the United States to cooperate on bolstering security in Afghanistan, one area where the arch rivals could agree, as Trump seeks an exit from AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest war.  The United States and Iran share an interest in ensuring that a departure of the more than 20,000 U.S.-led foreign troops does not plunge Afghanistan into a civil war that restores the TalibanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harsh version of Islamic rule, and does not allow al Qaeda or other Sunni Muslim extremist groups to expand there.  The Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), after an old name for the region, first appeared in eastern Afghanistan in 2014, and has since made inroads into other areas, particularly the north.  Trump also told reporters at the White House that if Europe does not take Islamic State fighters held as prisoners, he will have to release them into the countries from which they came, such as Germany and France.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re holding thousands of ISIS fighters right now, and Europe has to take them. If Europe doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take them, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have no choice but to release them into the countries from which they came, which is Germany and France and other places,Ã¢â‚¬Â Trump said, adding: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The United States is not going to put them in Guantanamo and pay for that.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Thousands of people, including men, women and children from more than 50 countries, are lingering in detention camps in northeastern Syria, held by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.  The group includes at least 2,000 suspected foreign fighters, many from Western countries, whose fates remain unresolved against a backdrop of protracted diplomacy.

Ukraine has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe and has recorded more than 57,000 measles cases since the start of the year, including 18 deaths: An unprecedented number since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.    Advertisement  Advertisement  In mid-August, the government threatened to ban unvaccinated children from access to schools.  The Kiev protesters, many of them young parents with children and some from the provinces, insisted they had the right to refuse vaccinations.  ""I am for a free choice and against discrimination,"" said Alla Fedorchuk, a 25-year-old who travelled to the capital from the western city of Lutsk.  Her three-year-old son has not been vaccinated. Fedorchuk said a relative suffered side effects after being vaccinated.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Some protesters carried banners that read ""Forced medical intervention is a crime.""  Authorities blame strong opposition to vaccinations among a part of the population and vaccine shortages for the current crisis.  Urging parents to vaccinate their children, the health ministry organised mass vaccinations in schools in areas most affected by the crisis.  In late July, the government launched a vaccination campaign against diphtheria and tetanus.  ""Vaccination coverage among children is about 70 per cent, among adults it is even lower. Experts predict an outbreak"" of these dangerous infections, said acting health minister Ulyana Suprun.  There is growing concern over global public resistance to vaccinations.  Measles cases nearly tripled globally during the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2018, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said this month.    Measles, which is highly contagious, can be entirely prevented through a two-dose vaccine, but the WHO has in recent months sounded the alarm over vaccination rates.  The airborne infection causing fever, coughing and rashes can be deadly in rare cases and had been officially eliminated in many countries with advanced healthcare systems.",en,diseas,,

Another had over 18 weapons, including sawed-off shotguns, AR-15s, and a grenade launcher.  Earlier this year, the two might not have drawn the attention of US law enforcement.  Advertisement  Advertisement  But ever since a young racist slaughtered 22 at a Texas Walmart, and another man murdered 10 in Ohio three weekends ago, the FBI has arrested at least seven right-wing extremists in what appears to be a more earnest effort to target white nationalist threats in the United States.  VAULTS OF GUNS, CRATES OF AMMUNITION  These are some examples of the deeply disturbing cases.  On Aug 8, a 23-year-old Las Vegas security guard who communicated with neo-Nazis was arrested with bomb-making materials and indications he might target a synagogue or gay nightclub.  Advertisement  Advertisement  A week later, a Connecticut man, 22, was detained after suggesting online that he would carry out a mass shooting. At his home, investigators found multiple hand and long guns, camouflage outfits, titanium body armor and a combat helmet.    This CCTV image shows the gunman identified as Patrick Crusius, 21 years old, as he enters the Cielo Vista Walmart store in El Paso on Aug 3, 2019. (Images: AFP/KTSM 9/KTSM 9 news channel)  On Aug 12, an 18-year-old who voiced support for mass shootings was indicted for threatening to kill law enforcement officers. At his home, he had a vault full of weapons and 10,000 rounds of ammunition.  Four days after that, Florida police arrested a 25-year-old man who texted his girlfriend that he was planning a mass shooting and envisioned ""100 good kills.""  On Aug 17, a 20-year-old white nationalist was arrested in Ohio for threatening a Jewish community center. At his home, he had amassed multiple semi-automatic assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, and a gas mask.  And this week, police in Long Beach, California, arrested a man for making a mass shooting threat, and found at his home several illegal assault rifles, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and high-capacity magazines.  FBI WAKING UP  The arrests brought to light the extent of the threat of extremist ideology on the right, and its ability to motivate uniformly young, white men into acting on their hate.  They also, analysts said, mark a change after US justice authorities have been accused for years of doing little about domestic terrorism, which has now killed more Americans since 2002 than Islamist extremism.  ""I think that federal law enforcement understand that this is at the highest level of concern,"" said Brian Levin, head of the Study for Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino.  ""They are certainly devoting a decent amount of investigative resources.""  Analysts say President Donald Trump's refusal to attack white nationalists and neo-Nazis in the wake of several shootings and violent incidents had left the FBI reticent about fully confronting the threat.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque  The FBI feels held back from opening investigations by Trump's refusal to criticize people he considers part of his loyal voter base, former FBI terrorism supervisor Dave Gomez told The Washington Post.  ""It's a no-win situation for the FBI agent and his supervisor.""  850 DOMESTIC TERROR PROBES  But the agency has now clearly recognized the priority.  FBI Director Christopher Wray said in July that they have 850 open ""domestic terror"" investigations and have made 100 arrests so far. The majority of those cases, he said, are ""what you might call white supremacist violence.""  But Wray also stressed that they were targeting crimes rather than an ideology - a sharply different approach than that for Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda sympathizers, who can be arrested for expressing support for outlawed jihadists.  Members and supporters of the National Socialist Movement, one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the US, hold a rally on April 21, 2018 in Newnan, Georgia AFP/SPENCER PLATT  Wray's predecessor Andrew McCabe said Friday that the agency is overcoming that wariness, even if it could mean encroachments on civil liberties.  ""I think the FBI appears to be refocusing, and augmenting their efforts on the domestic terrorist threat,"" McCabe told CNN.  Now there is ""a much higher degree of sensitivity... to the statements which are now seen as predictors of potentially mass shootings,"" he said.  Levin said the arrests also show that, after the shock of recent mass shootings, the US public is more attuned to the ideological threat and ready to report any hints by perpetrators of their radical ideologies.  ""I think that has created a familiarity among the public with what certain warning signs are,"" he said.",en,terrorattack,,

FILE PHOTO: Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan receives Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud in Abu Dhabi, UAE, November 22, 2018. Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo  From Egypt to Sudan and the Horn of Africa, the two Gulf monarchies have coordinated their use of financial clout and Ã¢â‚¬â€ in Yemen Ã¢â‚¬â€ military force to redraw the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political landscape to their advantage.  But this month, at his Mecca palace, Saudi King Salman took the unusual step of expressing Ã¢â‚¬Å“extreme irritationÃ¢â‚¬Â with the UAE, his closest Arab partner, according to sources familiar with the matter.  The comment appears to be evidence of a fissure in the alliance, which is led in practice by the kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), and the UAE de facto ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (MbZ).  A loosening of UAE-Saudi ties has implications far beyond bilateral ties. A rift could undermine TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum pressureÃ¢â‚¬Â push against Tehran, damage Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, and reverberate in other theatres of conflict, so extensive has the two partnersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ influence been in a region critical to world oil supplies.  The immediate source of strain is YemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruinous war. Friction had been growing for months over the conflict, which was initially expected to last a few weeks but has dragged on for years and killed tens of thousands with no end in sight.  A wider cause is the UAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apparent decision to pivot towards narrower national interests, casting itself as the more mature partner that can stabilise the region, even if it means cutting losses and moving on without Riyadh.  The UAE also appears keen to salvage its image in Washington, where the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi deepened worries that the kingdomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy was growing impulsive and interventionist.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The UAE wants to be seen as the small country that facilitates peace and stability rather than an appendage to a triumphant expansionist Saudi,Ã¢â‚¬Â said a source familiar with the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is in a way (putting) their interests first, because they think if you have an expansionist Saudi, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to engulf them,Ã¢â‚¬Â the source added.  BOTH COUNTRIES Ã¢â‚¬Å“COMPLETELY ALIGNEDÃ¢â‚¬Â  The kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annoyance was voiced in a conversation on Aug. 11 with President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, head of YemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Saudi-backed government, according to two Yemeni sources and one other briefed on the meeting.  HadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces in Aden had just been routed by troops supported by the UAE, as nominal allies in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s south turned on each other in a power struggle.  Asked for comment, a Saudi official described that account as false and said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Saudi Arabia and the UAE remain strategically aligned on the sources of instability in the Middle East and cooperate very closely to counter a wide array of security threats in the region and beyond. Bilateral relations between the two nations are unshakable.Ã¢â‚¬Â  UAE authorities did not respond to questions about the remark. A UAE official earlier told Reuters both countries were Ã¢â‚¬Å“completely alignedÃ¢â‚¬Â on Yemen and that with Iran, de-escalation was the only way forward.  Any divisions may worry the White House, which has invested much of its Middle East policy in the pair. The Saudi deputy defence minister is meeting the U.S. secretary of state in Washington on Wednesday.  A U.S. official said talks would focus on Yemen and include a push for Riyadh to mend fences with the UAE.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Strains grew acute this summer over Yemen, after months of unease on other issues. When MbS and MbZ went to war in 2015 against YemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels and later imposed a boycott on Qatar, supporters hailed a new era of decisive action in a region more accustomed to time-consuming conciliation.  The two men also waded into conflicts in Egypt, Sudan and Libya. They sought to contain Iran and Islamists seen as threatening their dynastic rule following the 2011 Arab Spring.  But as Riyadh flexed muscles by cutting ties with Canada, briefly detaining LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prime minister, and aggravating relations with Jordan and Morocco, the UAE saw its carefully crafted image as a stabilising force imperilled by association.  UNPOPULAR WAR  Then, in June, the UAE scaled down its military presence in Yemen, saddling Riyadh with an unpopular war it had launched to neutralise the Houthis and prevent Iran from consolidating influence along the border.  A senior Emirati official said the move was a natural progression due to a U.N.-sponsored peace deal in the western port of Hodeidah.  But some diplomats say the UAE accepted there was no military solution, were sensitive to criticism of the humanitarian disaster and coalition air strikes that have killed civilians, and that rising Iran tensions precipitated the decision.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was not perceived in a positive way. The Saudis felt abandoned,Ã¢â‚¬Â said a Western diplomat. Abu Dhabi says the move was coordinated with Riyadh in advance and reflected realities on the ground as the U.N. moved to pave the way for peace talks.  Another diplomat said the relationship was fracturing: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Their strategic interests are similar but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite match.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The UAE also downplayed divisions after separatists it backs seized Aden, interim seat of HadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government, this month, but did not ask them to cede control and criticised HadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government as Ã¢â‚¬Å“weakÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ineffectiveÃ¢â‚¬Â.  **Read a factbox on Yemen's multi-sided war**  The Sunni Muslim Arab powers also appear divergent over ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite foe Iran. They both pushed for a stronger U.S. stand against TehranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regional activities and missile capabilities, but the UAE struck a softer tone after tanker explosions in Gulf waters that Washington and Riyadh blamed on Iran.  Iran denies involvement, but some in the Gulf fear a direct confrontation that could endanger the UAE and its economy. The UAE, having built its reputation as a business haven, is more vulnerable than Saudi Arabia, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest oil exporter, and sees itself as a regional stabiliser.  HEDGING BETS  One source said it is hedging its bets as a small power: The UAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commercial hub Dubai has strong Iran trade ties.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The honeymoon (with Saudi Arabia) is over,Ã¢â‚¬Â said another source, pointing to Abu DhabiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent overtures to Iran, including maritime security talks revived last month.  A Gulf source said the alliance was Ã¢â‚¬Å“very much alive and wellÃ¢â‚¬Â in terms of combating regional threats like Iran and Islamists, but acknowledged a rebalancing as situations evolved.  One of those situations may involve IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in Yemen: As Washington builds a maritime coalition to secure Gulf waters, Iran could stoke tensions through the Houthis to pressure Saudi Arabia and avoid risking a tanker war like that of the 1980s.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yemen now looks like ground zero for Iranian escalation,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Matt Reed, vice president of energy consultancy Foreign Reports. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A tanker war risks becoming an international conflict, but Yemen is different.Ã¢â‚¬Â  FILE PHOTO: Pro-government soldiers patrol an area taken by government forces during recent clashes with southern separatists west of Ataq of the Shabwa province, Yemen August 26, 2019. REUTERS/Ali Owidha/File Photo  Riyadh accuses Iran of giving the Houthis missiles and drones to attack Saudi oil assets, a charge Tehran denies. It also fears spillover effects if Yemen fragments further.  By contrast, Abu DhabiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main concern is protecting the strategic Bab al-Mandeb waterway and keeping Islamists at bay.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are broadly strategically aligned. There are more similarities than differences, but we will start to see divergences,Ã¢â‚¬Â said one diplomat.

3285852,cnn,Jack Guy,Four European countries lose measles free status after outbreaks,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/health/europe-measles-outbreaks-scli-intl/index.html,29/8/2019 0:00,30/8/2019 1:47,"(CNN) Four European countries have lost their measles -free status as the region suffers a significant setback in eliminating the disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  With measles cases across Europe on course to double this year, the disease has made a comeback in Albania, Czech Republic, Greece and the United Kingdom, where it had previously been eradicated, a WHO report said.  Recent outbreaks of the potentially fatal viral disease in various countries have been blamed on the growth of the anti-vaccination movement, which has spread via social media and discourages parents from immunizing their children against measles and other diseases.  Right-wing populist politicians including Italy's Matteo Salvini, who has promoted a bill removing mandatory vaccination for children, have also been influential in pulling the public away from scientific orthodoxy.  At the end of 2018, 33 of 53 countries in the European region retained their measles elimination status. Two -- Austria and Switzerland -- achieved measles-free status, according to the WHO, which means they have not had any new cases of the disease for 36 months.  Two countries have interrupted measles transmission, having had no new cases for 12-35 months. Twelve countries remain endemic for measles, and the four countries mentioned previously have re-entered measles transmission.  ""Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning,"" said Dr GÃƒÂ¼nter Pfaff, Chair of the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC).  ""If high immunization coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily and some will tragically die.""  There have been approximately 90,000 cases of measles reported in the first half of 2019, continuing a surge in the number of cases that began in 2018, when 84,462 cases were reported over the course of the year.  The WHO has declared a Grade 2 emergency and intensified its efforts against measles, according to a statement.  ""Great efforts to control this highly contagious disease have brought us a long way towards regional elimination,"" said Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe.  ""This is the time and opportunity to address any underlying health system, social determinants and societal challenges that may have allowed this deadly virus to persist in this region.""  Online misinformation a key culprit  Social media is proving to be a key battleground for health information.  Professor Martin Marshall, vice-chair of Britain's Royal College of GPs, said the findings were ""disheartening"" at a time when Europe had been making good press in eliminating an entirely preventable disease. He drew a link between declining vaccination rates and the spread of ""anti-vaxer propaganda"" on social media.  ""It is clear that we are still suffering from entirely debunked claims around MMR (the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) that were perpetuated in the nineties -- and are now resurgent on social media and other online platforms,"" said Marshall in a statement.  However some social media platforms are taking action.  From August 28, Pinterest searches for vaccine-related terms will now only show results from institutions such as the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the WHO-established Vaccine Safety Net, in an attempt to stop the spread of anti-vax content.  ""Misinformation about vaccines is as contagious and dangerous as the diseases it helps to spread,"" said the WHO in a statement.  ""The World Health Organization welcomes Pinterest's leadership in protecting public health by only providing evidence-based information about vaccines to its users.""  A global issue  The issue has also reared its head in the US, which may soon lose its measles-free status due to outbreaks that have caused more than 900 cases of measles.  Those outbreaks have largely been among children in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community whose parents have refused to vaccinate them.  When the WHO declared in 2000 that the United States had eliminated measles, it was hailed as one of the biggest public health achievements in the nation's history.  Now there is a "" reasonable chance "" the country could lose its status in October, according to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  Health professionals are looking into a number of solutions, including making vaccinations mandatory and imposing fines on parents who refuse.  One example is Germany, where the government has backed a bill that would see parents fined up to Ã¢â€šÂ¬2,500 ($2,800) if they fail to vaccinate their children before entering school or kindergarten.  Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told CNN that health authorities should be in emergency mode due to the seriousness of the situation.  ""Ninety-thousand cases in the first half of the year is a massive amount of measles,"" she said, adding that nations should be ramping up routine vaccination programs to proactively identify under-vaccinated groups.  Larson also recommends that health authorities get involved in social media to spread positive messages about vaccines.  ""That's where people are,"" said Larson, who believes that efforts need to be made to crowd out anti-vax information.  ""We've created a world that's absolutely dependent on vaccination,"" she added.  ""This is a really big deal.""",en,diseas,,

The latest casualty in Uganda was a nine-year-old girl from the Democratic Republic of Congo, reviving fears that the virus could cross the porous borders of the central African country, where it erupted in August last year.  Advertisement  Advertisement  DR Congo health officials said late Thursday that there have been ""2,006 deaths (1,901 confirmed and 105 probable)"" since August 2018. adding that 902 people had been cured.  The toll is a setback coming a day before UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres visits for a first-hand assessment of the fightback.  Guterres wants to ""express support for the teams engaged in the Ebola fightback,"" the UN said.  More than 200,000 people have been vaccinated during DR Congo's tenth and most serious Ebola epidemic.  Advertisement  Advertisement  It is the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history after more than 11,000 people were killed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014 and 2016.  Containment efforts have been hindered by conflict in eastern DRC as well as attacks on Ebola fighters within affected communities.  ""For the moment, the situation is better than the past weeks. But in certain zones, there are many cases of community resistance. These are the zones which have brought forth the most confirmed cases,"" Robert Bahati from Oxfam said.  ""As a result, those who came in contact with confirmed cases have not been followed up,"" he said.  Jean-Edmond Bnanakawa Masumbuko, the mayor of Beni -- a major city which Guteress is due to visit -- said some people ""had the tendency of viewing Ebola treatment centres as deathtraps.  ""Out of the city's 14 zones, there are only four which continue to pose problems,"" he said.  FOURTH UGANDA DEATH  The nine-year-old girl who tested positive in Uganda after travelling from DR Congo died early Friday, a Ugandan health official told AFP.  ""She passed on at around 0800 (0500 GMT) this morning,"" said Yusuf Baseka, health director in Kasese, a district in southwestern Uganda along the border with DR Congo.  The child was diagnosed after exhibiting symptoms at a border crossing in Kasese on Wednesday.  She was subsequently isolated and transferred to an Ebola treatment unit.  The girl is the fourth victim diagnosed with Ebola in Uganda, which has been on high alert since last year, to have died from the virus.  In June, three members of a single family tested positive after entering from DR Congo. Two died in Uganda, while the third succumbed to the disease after returning to DR Congo.  The outbreak of the haemorrhagic virus began in the North Kivu province in eastern DR Congo on August 1, 2018 and spread to the neighbouring Ituri province.  The pathogen causes fever, vomiting and severe diarrhoea, often followed by kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.  The disease is spread by contact with infected bodily fluids and is fought with the time-honoured but laborious techniques of tracing contacts and quarantining them.  STEPPED UP CHECKS  The WHO has declared the epidemic a ""public health emergency of international concern"".  The virus has also spread to DR Congo's South Kivu province, which shares a land border with Rwanda and Burundi.  Screening is vital, but imperfect.  Ebola can take up to three weeks to incubate and cannot be spread until the infected person has symptoms, the WHO says.  But it can be difficult to clinically tell Ebola from malaria, typhoid fever or meningitis.  Uganda has stepped up checks for hundreds of schoolchildren who cross over from DR Congo every day to attend school there as jobs and educational opportunities are greater.  But it is not without inconvenience.  ""Sometimes we get to school late, because we have to be in line for checking and it takes time,"" said Doreane Kambari, a 16-year-old attending high school in Bwera in Kasese.  ",en,diseas,,

The complex attack came as the United States and the Taliban continued to seek an agreement in Qatar that would see thousands of American troops leave Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.  Officials said the assault started around 1am (2030 GMT on Friday) when Taliban fighters targeted the city from several directions.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the attack resulted in the capture of several important buildings.  ""The Taliban attacked Kunduz city from several directions this morning. We are in the city now capturing government buildings one after the other,"" he told reporters.  Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, a Kunduz police spokesman, told AFP news agency fighting was ongoing and commando forces had arrived to repel the Taliban attack.  The interior ministry said at least 34 Taliban fighters were killed in ground and air operations in three areas of Kunduz city. Government casualty figures were not given.  At least three civilians were killed and 41 wounded were taken to hospitals, said Ehsanullah Fazli, head of the public health department in Kunduz.  The Taliban was in control of the city's hospital, provincial council member Ghulam Rabani Rabani told The Associated Press.  The fighters took hospital patients hostage, defence ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai told reporters in Kabul. He did not say how many.  ""We could very easily attack but we don't want civilian casualties,"" he said. Hospital officials could not immediately be reached.  'Massive attack'  The Taliban launched the ""massive attack"" from several different points around the city, said Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, spokesman for the provincial police chief.  Reinforcements arrived in the city and the Afghan air force was supporting ground troops, Hussaini said.  Electricity and most telephone services were cut and Kunduz residents were sheltering in their houses.  Ahmadzai said 26 Taliban fighters had been killed in an air strike but he did not mention any casualties among civilians or Afghan security forces.  ""The city is completely empty, shops are locked, people aren't moving and light and heavy weapons can be heard in several parts of the city,"" said resident Khaluddin, who like many Afghans goes by a single name.  The armed group, which has demanded that all foreign forces leave Afghanistan, now controls or holds sway over roughly half of the country and is at its strongest since its 2001 defeat by a US-led invasion. Some 20,000 US and NATO forces remain in Afghanistan after formally ending their combat role in 2014.  They continue to train and support Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and a local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group.  Presidential spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said Afghan security forces were fending off the attack in some parts of the city, a strategic crossroads with easy access to much of northern Afghanistan as well as the capital, Kabul, about 335 kilometres away.  ""As always the Taliban have taken positions in civilian areas,"" Seddiqi said on Twitter.  Vulnerability  The Taliban has continued bloody assaults on civilians and security forces even as its leaders meet with a US peace envoy in Doha to negotiate an end to nearly 18 years of war. Talks were expected to continue on Saturday.  Both sides in recent days have signalled they are close to a deal.  The United States seeks Taliban guarantees that Afghanistan will no longer be a launching pad for attacks.  The Taliban seized Kunduz, at the heart of a major agricultural region near Tajikistan, for about two weeks in 2015 before withdrawing in the face of a NATO-backed Afghan offensive. The insurgents pushed into the city centre a year later, briefly raising their flag before gradually being driven out again.  The fall of Kunduz underscored the vulnerability of Afghan security forces and played a role in stopping the pullout of US forces under former President Barack Obama.  Since then, the city has come under frequent Taliban attack but the fighters have not been able to repeat a full capture.  ""We have lost the city in the past and know the Taliban can attack again from insecure areas,"" a politician from Kunduz, Fatima Azizi, told the local Ariana television channel on Saturday.  ""Unfortunately, civilians are again the victims.""",en,terrorattack,,

Mr Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born US diplomat overseeing negotiations for Washington, said that a deal was near after wrapping up the ninth round of talks with Taleban officials in Qatar.  ""We are at the threshold of an agreement that will reduce violence and open the door for Afghans to sit together to negotiate an honourable and sustainable peace and a unified, sovereign Afghanistan that does not threaten the United States, its allies, or any other country,"" he said in a Twitter post.  The comment came as Taleban fighters attacked Pul-e Khumri city in the northern province of Baghlan just a day after a major show of strength by hundreds of fighters who overran parts of Kunduz, a strategic city the insurgents have twice come close to taking in recent years.  The Afghan Interior Ministry said in a statement yesterday that 20 Afghan security force members and five civilians were killed, and at least 85 civilians were injured in Kunduz during clashes with the Taleban fighters.  With talks in Doha, Qatar, close to wrapping up, the latest fighting underlined the Taleban's apparent determination to go into any deal from a position of strength on the battlefield.  Mr Khalilzad gave no details of the deal, which is expected to see thousands of US troops withdrawn from Afghanistan in exchange for guarantees by the Taleban not to allow the country to be used as a base for militant attacks abroad.  Mr Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taleban's political office in Doha, said both sides were in discussions to finalise technical issues. ""We are on the verge of ending the invasion and reaching a peaceful solution for Afghanistan,"" he said on Twitter.  NEARING A DEAL We are on the verge of ending the invasion and reaching a peaceful solution for Afghanistan. MR SUHAIL SHAHEEN, a spokesman for the Taleban's political office in Doha.  The agreement would not on its own end the fighting between the Taleban and Afghan security forces, but would allow the start of so-called ""intra-Afghan"" peace talks, which are expected to be held in the Norwegian capital of Oslo.  But it was not clear whether the Taleban would agree to talk directly with the Western-backed government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, which it considers an illegitimate foreign-imposed regime.  Some Taleban officials have said they would agree to talk to Afghan officials only in a private capacity, not as representatives of the state, and they remain opposed to a presidential election scheduled for Sept 28.  It was also unclear whether the agreement would cover the full withdrawal of all 14,500 US troops from Afghanistan or how long a pullout would take.  Over 20,000 foreign troops are in the country, most serving as part of a Nato-led mission to train and assist Afghan forces. Thousands of US troops are also engaged in a separate counter-terrorism mission fighting militant groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  Suicide bombings and combat operations have continued throughout the talks and the fighting in the north underlined the vulnerability of large parts of Afghanistan, where the Taleban controls more territory than at any time since being overthrown by a US-led campaign in 2001.

The Islamist group issued a statement after Trump unexpectedly cancelled secret talks planned for Sunday with the TalibanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major leaders at the presidential compound in Camp David, Maryland. He broke off the talks on Saturday after the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul last week that killed an American soldier and 11 others.  Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, criticized Trump for calling off the dialogue and said U.S. forces have been pounding Afghanistan with attacks at the same time.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This will lead to more losses to the U.S.,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Its credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Afghan peace talks were on hold and Washington would not reduce U.S. military support for Afghan troops until it was convinced the Taliban could follow through on significant commitments.  The United States has recalled U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad to chart the path forward, Pompeo said in appearances on Sunday TV news shows. Asked on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fox News SundayÃ¢â‚¬Â whether Afghan talks were dead, Pompeo said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“For the time being they are.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Trump has long wanted to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan - since his days as a candidate - and American diplomats have been talking with Taliban representatives for months about a plan to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops in exchange for security guarantees by the Taliban.  U.S. and Taliban negotiators struck a draft peace deal last week that could have led to a drawdown of troops from AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest war. There are currently 14,000 U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops in the country, 18 years after its invasion by a U.S.-led coalition following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States.  Fighting in Afghanistan has continued amid the talks and recent assaults by the Taliban cast doubts over the draft deal. As violence has escalated, Afghan leaders including President Ashraf Ghani have been increasingly critical of the deal and encouraged the Taliban to enter direct talks.  Asked whether the collapse of talks put a U.S. troop pullout on hold as well, Pompeo said the issue would be discussed. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The president hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet made a decision on that,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said on ABCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Week.Ã¢â‚¬Â  FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump announces opioid response grants to state governments in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, U.S. September 4, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott  CAMP DAVID SURPRISE  Trump decided to get personally involved to get the agreement to the finish line at Camp David after Ã¢â‚¬Å“real progressÃ¢â‚¬Â had been made in talks, Pompeo said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“President Trump ultimately made the decision,Ã¢â‚¬Â Pompeo told Fox. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI want to talk to (President) Ashraf Ghani. I want to talk to these Taliban negotiators. I want to look them in the eye. I want to see if we can get to the final outcome we needed.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â  The U.S. president has touted his skills as a negotiator and personal rapport with world leaders including Kim Jong Un of North Korea, but such one-on-one diplomacy has not led to any breakthrough deals so far.  Trump was criticized, even by some fellow Republicans, for having offered to host on U.S. soil a militant group that has killed American troops and had sheltered al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Camp David is where AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,Ã¢â‚¬Â U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican whose father, Dick Cheney, was U.S. vice president at the time of the attacks, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Ã¢â‚¬Å“No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Americans will on Wednesday mark the 18th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.  Taliban fighters, who now control more territory than at any time since 2001, launched assaults over the past week that included a suicide attack in Kabul on Thursday that killed U.S. Army Sergeant Elis Barreto Ortiz, 34, from Puerto Rico.  Earlier this month, senior security officials in Kabul said joint air raids by U.S. and Afghan forces against the Taliban have not subsided. Pompeo said more than 1,000 Taliban fighters have been killed in Afghanistan in the last 10 days.  Nine former U.S. ambassadors warned on Tuesday that Afghanistan could collapse in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“total civil warÃ¢â‚¬Â if Trump withdraws all U.S. forces before the Kabul government and the Taliban conclude a peace settlement.  Slideshow (3 Images)  Pompeo downplayed chances of a premature withdrawal.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“President Trump made clear weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not just going to withdraw because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a timeline.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trump has actually proven pretty reluctant to use force. We saw this earlier play out in the U-turn on the mission planned in response to the downing of our drone,Ã¢â‚¬Â noted Brett Bruen, a former U.S. diplomat who served as a director of global engagement at the White House. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The more likely scenario is similar to what happened with [Syrian President Bashar al-AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] use of chemical weapons Ã¢â‚¬â€œ launch a few missiles and call it a day. It will be seen by our allies as an appropriate, proportional response. It wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t preclude the possibility of talks.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been at war with Saudi Arabia and its allies over control of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capital city, SanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a, were quick to claim responsibility for the air assault which sent stocks tumbling over 100 points in early trading Monday and spiked gasoline prices some 15 cents a gallon.  But, officials have been skeptical.  Satellite photographs of the strike points Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of which there were at least 17 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ indicated that the vehicles originated from either Iran, Iraq, or the northern Persian Gulf rather than Yemen, on Saudi ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s southern border.  Baghdad has dismissed the possibility that the attacks stemmed from its terrain.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also lambasted the Ã¢â‚¬Å“unprecedented attack on the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy supply,Ã¢â‚¬Â underscoring that there was Ã¢â‚¬Å“no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out that while the Houthis were known to have acquired strike systems with the necessary range, the militia had Ã¢â‚¬Å“no advanced technology baseÃ¢â‚¬Â and was Ã¢â‚¬Å“dependent on imported missilesÃ¢â‚¬Â and other drone technologies for attacks.  The Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs told Fox News in a statement on Thursday that Ã¢â‚¬Å“initial investigations have indicated that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian weapons,Ã¢â‚¬Â but investigations were ongoing to determine the source.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This attack is in line with the previous attacks against Saudi Aramco pumping stations using Iranian weapons. As the investigations are ongoing, the Kingdom will invite UN and international experts to view the situation on the ground and to participate in the investigations,Ã¢â‚¬Â the statement continued. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Kingdom will take the appropriate measures based on the results of the investigation to ensure its security and stability. The Kingdom affirms that it has the capability and resolve to defend its land and people, and to forcefully respond to these aggressions.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹As with recent attacks on ships and oil facilities, investigators may never be able to conclusively determine its origin.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The United States military, with our interagency team, is working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran,Ã¢â‚¬Â Defense Secretary Mark Esper tweeted on Monday afternoon, announcing that he had briefed Trump on the situation after first speaking to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Iraqi Defense Minister Najah al-Shammary about the recent attack.  FEARS U.S. WEAPONS ARE FALLING INTO THE 'WRONG HANDS' DURING CHAOTIC YEMEN WAR  Iran vehemently has denied accusations that it executed the drone assault. Some analysts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ citing previous attacks over the summer, one in which involved Iran allegedly downed a $125 million U.S. surveillance drone over international waters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ said the rogue nation was operating on a policy of plausible deniability.  Nonetheless, Brigadier-General Amir Ali Hajizadeh of IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Revolutionary Guard Corps said Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as Al Jazeera reported Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that they were ready for Ã¢â‚¬Å“full-scale war.Ã¢â‚¬Â  And, if the Houthis are proven to have played a prominent role Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even at the behest of their Iranian backers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it could send the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protracted conflict and humanitarian disaster into a whole new level of devastation.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The recent military escalation is extremely worrying,Ã¢â‚¬Â the UN Special Envoy for YemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Office responded. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Special Envoy urges all parties to prevent such further incidents, which pose a serious threat to regional security, complicate the already fragile situation and jeopardize UN-led political process.Ã¢â‚¬Â  As for the next steps, defense analyst John Wood anticipated that Washington will allow Saudi Arabia to take the lead.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was the Kingdom that was attacked, and it is the Kingdom with the most to lose. The attack clearly shows how weak and desperate Iran has become, and with more sanctions, is likely to come,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“At the moment, the situation is quite manageable. However, if one side or the other should decide to cripple the other oilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infrastructure, there will be a war that will engulf the whole Middle East.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Such a hypothetical war, experts contended, could spark a crisis for the U.S. government.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It's important to remember that Saudi Arabia was attacked, not the United States. For that reason, the president has no authority to launch strikes without congressional authorization,Ã¢â‚¬Â Benjamin Friedman, a policy director of Defense Priorities, contended. Ã¢â‚¬Å“No matter what, Washington should not use the U.S. military to clean up Saudi Arabia's mess, but the odds of that happening are much too likely. Presumably, all options are on the table, but military options are likely to create escalation far more damaging than Saturday's attacks.Ã¢â‚¬Â  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Moreover, Joseph Duggan, a geopolitical consultant who worked as a speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, in the State Department for President Ronald Reagan, and in Saudi Arabia for six years at Aramco headquarters, cautioned that the perpetrators of the attack sought to Ã¢â‚¬Å“provoke a United States president and Congress into hasty and costly intervention.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We won the Cold War by resisting the temptation to go to war when there were flashpoints such as this. We are much stronger than Iran,Ã¢â‚¬Â Duggan added. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We should refuse to take the bait of answering a spectacular attack with a showy gesture that is not strategically sound. We need to operate steadily, and usually covertly, to degrade their ability to harm our allies and our interests.Ã¢â‚¬Â",en,terrorattack,,

The Houthi rebel group said that its weapons could reach anywhere in Saudi Arabia. Last Saturday's strikes were carried out by aircraft equipped with a new type of engine, it said.  ""We assure the Saudi regime that our long hand can reach wherever we want, and whenever we want,"" Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement.  ""We warn companies and foreigners not to be present in the facilities that were hit in the strikes because they are still within range and may be targeted at any moment.""  United States Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said on Sunday there was no evidence the raids were carried out from Yemen. He blamed Iran, as did Energy Secretary Rick Perry yesterday.  Saudi Arabia is leading the coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen, waging a bombing campaign that has killed thousands.  The Western-backed Sunni Muslim alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognised government ousted from power by the Houthis in the capital Sanaa.  The war is considered the world's greatest humanitarian crisis of recent years, displacing millions of people and leaving millions more at risk of starvation.  The Houthis claimed to have used 10 drones in last Saturday's attack; US officials said there were 17 points of impact.

The rebel group has launched missile and drone attacks into Saudi territory before, but never anything on that scale or against such vital targets, or so deep into the kingdom, some 800km from Yemeni territory.  At a news conference last night, Saudi military spokesman Turki al-Maliki said the kingdom's ini-tial investigations showed that ""the terrorist attack did not come from Yemen, as claimed by the Houthi militia"".  ""This terrorist attack is a large-scale cowardly act and as I said, targets the global economy and not just the kingdom,"" he said.  ""All the indications and operational evidence, and the weapons that were used in the terrorist attack, whether in Buqayq or Khurais, indicate with initial evidence that these weapons are Iranian weapons,"" he added.  Colonel al-Maliki offered no immediate evidence to support his allegations, which came after US President Donald Trump said the US awaited word from Saudi Arabia about who it suspected launched the attacks.  Col al-Malki said Saudi Arabia was capable of protecting vital energy and economic sites. He added that the authorities would reveal the location from where the drones were launched at a future news briefing.  Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi said he received a call yesterday from Mr Pompeo, who confirmed that the attack did not come from Iraq.  Iraq is home to Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias who aided it in its fight against militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi again denied the US' claims yesterday, telling journalists that the accusation was ""condemned, unacceptable and categorically baseless"".

Five pigs found dead at a farm in Paju, a city near the inter-Korean border, were confirmed to have been infected with the virus, an official with Seoul's agriculture ministry said.  ""At this point, it's too early to confirm if the case stemmed from the North,"" the official added.

His comments come hours after President Trump tweeted that he had ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Ã¢â‚¬Å“substantially increase sanctionsÃ¢â‚¬Â on Iran, amid escalating tensions between the two countries.  Earlier this week, Trump said it was ""looking like"" Iran was responsible for the bombing but did not publically accuse Tehran of the attack.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looking that way,Ã¢â‚¬Â the president told reporters at the White House on Monday when asked if Iran was responsible. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll let you know definitively.Ã¢â‚¬Â He added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being checked out right now.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Iran, who has repeatedly denied involvement in the bombings, warned Wednesday that it would ""immediately"" retaliate against the United States if Tehran is targeted over a crippling weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities.  The threat, which was sent via the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, also condemned previous remarks made by Secretary Pompeo and other high-ranking U.S. officials suggesting Iran was behind the move.  POMPEO ACCUSES IRAN OF 'UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK' AFTER DRONES HIT SAUDI OIL FACILITIES  Ã¢â‚¬Å“IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response will be prompt and strong, and it may include broader areas than the source of attacks,Ã¢â‚¬Â IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mehr News Agency reported.  TehranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fars News Agency added that any response would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“rapid and crushing.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Meanwhile, Saudi officials alleged on Wednesday that Iranian cruise missiles and drones were behind the attack on Sunday, showing journalists remains of the weapons. However, they stopped short of directly accusing Iran of launching the assault.  Saudi military spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki said the attack ""came from the north,"" without saying specifically where it originated. Iraq and Iran are to the north of Saudi Arabia across the Persian Gulf.  ""The attack could not have originated from Yemen,"" he said, disputing the claim by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels that they launched the weapons.  Saudi officials said the cruise missile, which had what appeared to be a jet engine attached to it, was a land-attack cruise missile that failed to explode.  ""Almost certainly it's Iranian-backed,"" Prince Khalid bin Bandar, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Kingdom, told the BBC. ""We are trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.""  Cmdr. Joshua Frey, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, declined to comment on the Saudi announcement, saying it ""would be inappropriate to comment on the status of individual nations and the nature of any potential support.""  IRAN CRUISE MISSILES AND DRONES USED IN SAUDI OIL FACILITIES, US OFFICIALS SAY  IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s state-run news agency also reported that the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s president and the foreign minister may not be able to attend next weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-level meetings at the United Nations because the U.S. has yet to issue them valid visas.  As the host of the U.N.'s headquarters, the U.S. is mandated to offer world leaders and diplomats visas to attend meetings there. But as tensions have risen, the U.S. has put increasing restrictions on Iranians like Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Since becoming Iran's president in 2013, Hassan Rouhani has spoken each year at the General Assembly.  The U.N. meeting had been viewed as an opportunity for direct talks between Rouhani and Trump amid of a summer of heightened tensions and attacks in the wake of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unilateral withdrawal from IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nuclear deal with world powers a year ago.  NEW UN AMBASSADOR KELLY CRAFT VOWS 'STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP' AS SHE TAKES HER POST  However, the likelihood of such talks decreased dramatically following the Saudi oil attack, U.S. accusations that Iran was behind it and hardening comments from Iran. YemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have claimed the attack was in response to the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has sparked the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst humanitarian crisis and killed tens of thousands of people.  Iran sent a note through Swiss diplomats in Tehran on Monday, reiterating that Tehran denies being involved in the Saudi attack, IRNA reported. The Swiss have looked after American interests in Tehran for decades.  Pompeo is traveling to Saudi Arabia for meetings after Saturday's attack, which hit a Saudi oil field and the world's largest crude oil processing plant.  US SHARES INFO WITH SAUDI ARABIA THAT BLAMES IRAN FOR OIL FIELD ATTACK: REPORT  The coalition aims to secure the broader Persian Gulf region. It includes surveillance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world's oil travels, and the Bab el-Mandeb, another narrow strait that connects the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden off Yemen and East Africa.  The U.S. blames Iran for the apparent limpet mine explosions on four vessels in May and another two in June sailing in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz, something Iran denies being behind. Iran also seized a British-flagged oil tanker and another based in the United Arab Emirates after the British seized a tanker carrying Iranian oil.  ROUHANI SAYS IRAN'S RESPONSE TO BILATERAL TALKS WILL ALWAYS BE 'NEGATIVE'  In Tehran, Rouhani told his Cabinet that Saudi Arabia should see the weekend attack as a warning to end its war in Yemen, where it has fought the Houthi rebels since 2015 and sought to restore the internationally recognized government.  Rouhani said Yemenis ""did not hit hospitals, they did not hit schools or the Sanaa bazaar,"" referring to the Saudi-led coalition's widely criticized airstrikes on civilian targets.  He added that Iran does not want conflict in the region, but it was the Saudi-led coalition that ""waged the war in the region and ruined Yemen."" Saying the Houthis were responsible for the drone strikes, he said: ""They attacked an industrial center to warn you. Learn the lesson from the warning.""  Iran's defense minister, Gen. Amir Hatami, also denied his country launched the attack, saying the Houthis had the capability to launch the assault.  Wednesday's announcements come after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said late Tuesday that more than half of the country's daily crude oil production that was knocked out by an attack had been recovered. He said production capacity at the targeted plants would be fully restored by the end of the month, in part by drawing from Saudi reserves of crude oil.  Pompeo was due to land in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, where he was scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Pompeo will later travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to meet with Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Both nations are U.S. allies and have been fighting against the Houthis in Yemen.  Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday that U.S. military experts were in Saudi Arabia working with their counterparts to ""do the forensics on the attack"" -- gleaning evidence that could help build a convincing case for where the weapons originated.

Pompeo has blamed Iran for the dramatic weekend assault on two facilities, condemning an ""act of war"" which knocked out half the kingdom's oil production.  The rhetoric has raised the risk of an unpredictable escalation in a tinderbox region where Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a decades-old struggle for dominance.  After meeting with allies in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, Pompeo said there was an ""enormous consensus in the region"" that Iran carried out the attacks, despite its denials and Yemeni rebels' claims that they were responsible.  But Pompeo said the US was intent on finding a way out of the confrontation.  ""We'd like a peaceful resolution. I think we've demonstrated that,"" he told reporters.  ""I hope the Islamic Republic of Iran sees it the same way.""  Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier warned any US or Saudi military strike on Iran could cause ""all-out war"".

'GLASS TOWERS'  Saudi officials on Wednesday unveiled what they said were fragments of 25 drones and cruise missiles fired on Saturday at the oil facilities in the country's east, engulfing them in flames.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also said the Huthi claim ""lacks credibility"".  The Huthis have, however, hit dozens of targets in Saudi Arabia, and their rapidly advancing arsenal has exposed the kingdom's vulnerability despite its vast military spending.  The Huthis said Saturday's assault was launched from three locations inside Yemen, using advanced drones with long-range capabilities.  They also threatened the United Arab Emirates - a key member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Shiite rebels - with strikes against ""towers made of glass that cannot withstand one drone"", in apparent reference to the glitzy cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  US military planners weighing retaliation have reportedly prepared a list of Iranian targets including the Abadan oil refinery, one of the world's largest, and Khark Island, the country's biggest crude export facility, the New York Times said.  Other potential targets include missile launch sites and other assets of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, along with bases near the Gulf.  ""Any strikes against Iran would almost certainly be carried out by volleys of cruise missiles from (US) Navy vessels. Strike aircraft would be aloft to carry out attacks if Iran retaliated against the first wave,"" the newspaper said.  'NEW CONTEXT'  The United Nations said on Thursday that experts had arrived in Saudi Arabia to investigate Saturday's attack, ""at the invitation of the Saudi authorities"".  US officials quoted by CBS News say unreleased satellite photos showed Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps making preparations for the attack at Ahvaz airbase.  The latest spike in tensions has dampened speculation of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week.  French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for the meeting to defuse the standoff over the Iranian nuclear programme.  But on Thursday, a French presidential official who asked not to be named said Saturday's attack ""creates a new context"".  ""There are still lots of things to sort out before we can see how to create the conditions for the United States and Iran to enter into a negotiation,"" the official said.  But Iran's foreign ministry reported Thursday that Zarif was set to leave for New York on Friday, apparently implying that both he and Rouhani had received visas for the UN summit.  State media had on Wednesday cast doubt on whether they would secure the necessary permits.  Zarif has been under US sanctions since July 31.  However, with tensions in the Gulf once again threatening to bubble over, Cinzia Bianco, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, warned of ""an out-of-control chain of escalatory events.""

The announcement comes after a wave of drone strikes last weekend on Saudi oil installations knocked out half of the kingdom's production and sent shock waves through energy markets.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The Iran-backed Huthis claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Riyadh's ally Washington has condemned them as an ""act of war"", placing the blame on Tehran and announcing new sanctions against the Islamic republic.  Mehdi al-Mashat, head of the Huthis' supreme political council, announced in a speech marking the 2014 rebel seizure of Sanaa ""the halt of all attacks against the territory of Saudi Arabia"".  He added that he hoped ""the gesture would be answered by a stronger gesture"" from the Saudis, according to the rebels' Al-Masirah television channel.  ""Pursuing war is not in anyone's interest.""

(Photo: AFP/Mohammed Huwais)  He also called for the reopening of Sanaa's international airport and open access to Yemen's Red Sea port of Hodeida, a crucial entry point for imports and humanitarian aid.  The announcement was a sharp reversal from previous statements from the Huthis, who early on Friday had accused Saudi Arabia and its allies of endangering the fragile truce around Hodeida with strikes on four rebel targets north of the port.  The Huthis have been fighting against a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in 2015 to support the country's internationally recognised government.  Iran denies US and Saudi accusations that it arms the Huthis.  The rebels have repeatedly targeted key Saudi infrastructure in recent months in cross-border attacks.  The Sep 14 aerial attacks sparked fires at two Aramco oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia knocking out six per cent of global supplies.  It is the third attack in five months on the oil giant's infrastructure, after the Huthis also claimed strikes in May and August.  Saudi Arabia has so far not directly accused any party of carrying out Saturday's attacks, but said authorities have launched an investigation to determine the culprits.  Tehran has denied responsibility for the attacks against the heart of Saudi's all-important oil industry, raising the spectre of ""all-out war"" in the event of retaliatory measures by Washington or Riyadh.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said the weapons used were Iranian and vowed to release the full findings of the investigation.  Iran denies involvement in the attacks.  Earlier, a senior Iranian military official said Iran was ready to destroy any aggressor after the US announced it was sending troops to Saudi Arabia.  Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have said they were responsible for the drone and missile strikes on 14 September that affected the global oil supply.  Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated since US President Donald Trump abandoned a deal limiting Iran's nuclear activities last year and reinstated sanctions.  Saudi Arabia: 'Take a stand'  Speaking to reporters in Riyadh, Mr Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was in consultation with its allies and would take necessary and suitable measures after its investigation was complete, without giving details of possible actions.  He repeated that the strikes targeting the Abqaiq oil facility and the Khurais oil field had come from the north and not from Yemen but did not give a specific location, and urged the international community to take a stand.  ""The kingdom calls upon the international community to assume its responsibility in condemning those that stand behind this act, and to take a firm and clear position against this reckless behaviour that threatens the global economy,"" he said.

On Friday, Secretary of Defence Mark Esper said the US would send a yet-to-be-decided number of troops to Saudi Arabia to boost the country's air and missile defences.  President Trump then announced new sanctions against Iran, focusing on the country's central bank and its sovereign wealth fund, while signalling that he wanted to avoid military conflict.  Iran: 'We'll pursue any aggressor'  Earlier, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard in Iran, Maj Gen Hossein Salami, warned that the country's ""readiness to respond to any aggression is definitive"".  ""Be careful, a limited aggression won't remain limited. We'll pursue any aggressor,"" he said at the opening of an exhibition of captured drones in the capital, Tehran. ""We'll continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.""  Speaking at the same event, the head of the Guards' aerospace branch, Brig Gen Amirali Hajizadeh, said the US ought to learn from its past failures and that any attack on Iran would receive ""a crushing response"".  Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are an elite branch of Iran's military and have been designated a terrorist organisation by the US.  A game of brinkmanship  Analysis by Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor  Iranian officials - both political and military - have issued a series of fierce warnings about any potential attack on their territory.  The US has adopted a less confrontational tone, but has continued with the Trump administration's policy of applying maximum pressure.  New sanctions targeting Iran's national bank and the mobilisation of more US troops in the Gulf are all part of this strategy.  What seems clear is that this remains a game of brinkmanship, with all sides still hoping to be able to pull back from a direct military confrontation. But the pattern of dangerous escalation over recent weeks does not bode well for this strategy.  The background you need  The Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. They are in conflict with a Saudi-led coalition which backs a president who the rebels had forced to flee when the Yemeni conflict escalated in March 2015.  Iran, the regional rival of Saudi Arabia, is an opponent of the US, and tensions between the two have risen markedly this year. The US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May - accusations rejected by Tehran.",en,terrorattack,826,['Arabia']

The WHO said it had learned of one suspected fatal case in Dar es Salaam and two others but, despite repeated requests, was given no information.  Tanzania has said it has no suspected or confirmed cases.  The latest outbreak has killed more than 2,000 in eastern DR Congo, with Uganda battling to stop any spread.  An epidemic that ravaged parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016 killed more than 11,000 people.  What is the WHO complaining about?  A statement on Saturday said that on 10 September the organisation had learned of a suspected infection in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's most populous city, in what would be the country's first Ebola case.  It said the patient had been to Uganda, shown symptoms of Ebola in August, tested positive and died on 8 September. It said that the woman's contacts had been quarantined.  The WHO said it had unofficial reports of two other possible cases.  It said: ""Despite several requests, WHO did not receive further details of any of these cases from Tanzanian authorities.""  It added: ""The limited available official information from Tanzanian authorities represents a challenge for assessing the risk posed by this event.""  What has Tanzania said in response?  On 14 September, Tanzania said there were no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola in the country.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fear and myths: Why people are still in denial about Ebola  However, it did not directly address the case of the woman mentioned by the WHO and provided no further information.  Last week, US Health Secretary Alex Azar criticised Tanzania for its failure to share information on possible cases.  Tanzania is heavily reliant on tourism, which could be affected by confirmed cases.  What is the latest on the outbreak?  It began in the eastern DR Congo in August last year and is the biggest of 10 Ebola outbreaks to hit the country since 1976, when the virus was first discovered.  In July, the WHO declared the Ebola crisis in the country a ""public health emergency of international concern"".  There have been more than 3,000 cases and more than 2,000 deaths.  Other nations are on high alert. Four people have died after being diagnosed with the virus in Uganda, which has maintained largely successful screening centres along its border.  The disease can spread rapidly and similarly rapid measures are needed to control it, including hand-washing regimes and quarantines.  What is Ebola?  Image copyright BSIP/Getty Images",en,diseas,,

In a televised speech on Sunday marking the anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, Rouhani said Iran extends its ""hand of friendship and brotherhood"" towards countries in the region willing to cooperate in the Tehran-led effort to oversee security in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz - a vital gateway for the global oil industry.  In response to a recent decision by the United States to send more troops to the area, Rouhani went on to warn against the presence of foreign troops in the Gulf.  ""Foreign forces can cause problems and insecurity for our people and for our region,"" said Rouhani, who will travel to New York City later this week for the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN.  But some analysts expressed scepticism on whether Rouhani's security initiative could come to fruition, particularly without the United States being involved.  Simon Mabon, a senior lecturer on international relations at Lancaster University, said Iran sees itself as being ""uniquely qualified"" to organise a regional security structure.  Rouhani is likely to argue the past presence of foreign militaries has only ""brought devastation"" and they need to extricate themselves from the Gulf, while Tehran wants only to work with neighbouring nations based on ""dialogue and consensus"", he said.  ""[But] that type of rhetoric will not be well received in Riyadh and, to be honest, I can't see this taking off the ground if there is no place for the United States in this security architecture,"" Mabon told Al Jazeera.  190921101324217  Saudi oil attacks  Tensions in the region have reached new heights following attacks on two major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia last week.  The United States and Saudi Arabia have accused Iran of being behind the attacks on the Saudi Aramco plants, responsibility for which was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have been locked in a war with a Saudi-UAE-led military coalition since 2015.  Iran has denied any involvement.  Saudi Arabia will seek to make a case at the UN General Assembly for concerted action to punish and deter arch-foe Iran after the oil strikes.  However, even Riyadh's main allies - the United States and the United Arab Emirates - have little appetite for a conventional military confrontation, which may spark a war in the Gulf and drag in other oil producers, diplomats say.  The September 14 attack ""was a big escalation, there is a clear problem. But it is a real dilemma of how to react without escalating further"", said a Western diplomat. ""It is not clear yet what the US wants to do.""  Following the oil attacks, Washington said it was preparing to send weapons and hundreds of troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The US is also leading a maritime coalition, which includes the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UK and Australia, to secure the area's waterways and key oil trade routes.  In his speech, Rouhani called on the foreign powers to vacate the Gulf region.  ""Wherever the Americans or our enemies have gone Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ there has been insecurity afterwards,"" he said.  ""Your presence has always brought pain and misery... The farther you keep yourselves from our region and our nations, the more security there will be.""  Rouhani's speech was largely seen as a rallying call, said Al Jazeera's Assed Baig, reporting from Tehran, where a military parade marked the 39th anniversary of the start of the eight-year war with Iraq that began when Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980.  At the parade, Iran displayed the Khordad-3 air defence system that shot down a US drone in June. It also showed an Iranian medium-range missile that can travel up to 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) putting it in range of Iran's archrival Israel and US bases in the region.  Similar parades were held in major cities and towns across the country including the port city of Bandar Abbas near the Strait of Hormuz.  State TV showed scores of Iranian fast-attack boats, as well as air defence and other military equipment. It also carried images of Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval forces rappelling down the side of a sailing ship.  'Economic terrorism'  The attacks in Saudi Arabia have deepened a crisis that has escalated since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the multilateral nuclear deal signed in 2015 between Iran and world powers. Since then, Washington has reimposed crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy and pledged to drive Iran's oil exports to zero.  In response, Tehran has gradually scaled back its nuclear commitments and rejected any talks unless all sanctions are lifted.  During his speech, Rouhani described the sanctions as ""economic terrorism"" but said the ""revolutionary people"" of Iran were not intimidated by what he described as ""threats"".  ""Our people, for the last 40 years, and over the last 10 years specifically, we have been able to tolerate the pressure of the sanctions,"" he said.  Ahead of the UN General Assembly, Riyadh said it wants a peaceful resolution, but if a probe proved the strike came from Iran then ""this would be considered an act of war"".  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the US aims to avoid war with Iran, noting the additional forces deployed to the Gulf were for ""deterrence and defence"".  But he added: ""If that deterrence should continue to fail, I am also confident that President Trump would continue to take the actions that are necessary.""  The threat of outright war is likely to make all sides cautious.  ""I doubt anyone has the appetite for a direct clash between the US and Iran,"" said Barbara A Leaf, who was US ambassador to the UAE from 2014-2018 and is now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  ""It really requires re-establishing deterrence. Clearly there is none now.""",en,terrorattack,826,['Iran']

Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare but potentially fatal illness caused by mosquito bites. Several states in the northeast have reported cases of the illness in recent weeks, including a second death reported in Massachusetts on Friday.  In Connecticut, in addition to the death of the first person diagnosed this year, health officials announced a second person has tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis.  They urged residents to protect themselves and their children by avoiding outdoor activity from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.  The patient who tested positive is an adult who became ill during the second week of September and remains hospitalized.

The experimental vaccine, manufactured by the US-based firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J), will be introduced from mid-October in areas which do not have ""active Ebola transmission"", the United Nations' health agency said in a statement on Monday.  The J&J product will complement another experimental vaccine, produced by US pharmaceutical giant Merck, which has been administered to approximately 225,000 people to date. Neither Merck's nor J&J's Ebola vaccines are licensed.  DRC health officials had said on Saturday they planned to introduce the J&J product to tackle the outbreak, the second-worst in recorded history, but did not confirm at the time when it would be rolled out.  The introduction of a second vaccine has been a source of controversy among health officials in DRC, where Ebola erupted in August 2018 in the country's eastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces.  The second #Ebola vaccine - which is given as a 2-dose course, 56 days apart - will be provided to at-risk populations in areas that do not have active Ebola transmission in #DRC as an additional tool to extend protection against the virus https://t.co/mDYBX2lJvc pic.twitter.com/Op6AO7bhGt Ã¢â‚¬â€ World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) September 23, 2019  Former Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, who resigned after being stripped of oversight of the Ebola response in July, opposed the second vaccine's use. He said it had not been proven effective and could confuse local populations already in parts mistrustful over Ebola, given the difference in how it is dispensed.  J&J's vaccine requires two injections eight weeks apart. The Merck vaccine, estimated to be 97.5 percent effective, requires a single shot.  Ilunga said the differing dosing schedules could erode already fragile trust in response efforts and be difficult to implement in eastern DRC, where there are large numbers of displaced people and much of the population is highly mobile.  In his resignation letter, published on July 22, Ilunga also cited outside pressure to deploy the J&J product and accused unspecified ""actors"" of showing a ""lack of ethics"" over the issue.  But several proponents have urged the use of J&J's vaccine, calling for all ""available tools and resources"" to be deployed to end the Ebola epidemic.  On Monday, health expert Lawrence Gostin said he welcomed the decision to introduce the second vaccine, despite the move being ""late"", adding it should ""widen the scope of the population covered by immunity"".  ""We need a major increase in vaccination coverage in the DRC ... [so] it must be rapidly implemented,"" Gostin, faculty director at US-based Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, told Al Jazeera.  ""It is well within the power of DRC health authorities to educate the public without confusing them about the differences in the vaccines. The bottom line is simple; they are both very effective vaccines.""  J&J has tested its vaccine on more than 6,000 volunteers in several trials, according to the firm's website.  WHO 'too slow'  Gostin's comments came as MSF on Monday criticised the pace of ongoing inoculation as ""too slow"" in a stinging assessment of WHO's response to the Ebola crisis.  190922053618812  MSF singled out the agency for imposing ""tight controls on supply and eligibility criteria"" over Merck's product and said an international, independent committee should be created to oversee vaccination efforts instead.  WHO's approach is centred on a so-called ""ring strategy"", whereby all people found to have come into contact with someone with a confirmed case of Ebola are given the vaccine.  On occasions, blanket ""targeted geographic vaccination"" of entire neighbourhoods deemed to be at high risk from the virus is also carried out rather than vaccinating only known contacts and contacts of contacts.  According to MSF, between 450,000 and 600,000 people should have been immunised by now - more than double the actual number.  ""Our capacity to carry out real-time assessments and react accordingly is severely undermined by a rigid system which is hard to comprehend,"" Natalie Roberts, MSF's emergency coordinator, said in a statement.  ""Every day we see known contacts of confirmed Ebola patients who have not received their dose despite being eligible for vaccination,"" Roberts added.  ""It's like giving firefighters a bucket of water to put out a fire, but only allowing them to use one cup of water a day.""  Managing the 'finite doses available'  Commenting on MSF's criticisms, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency was carefully managing the ""finite number of doses available"".  ""If all doses were sent to the DRC, there would be no reserves available to respond should cases emerge in any of the high-risk neighbouring countries,"" Jasarevic told Al Jazeera.  He added that an international committee, such as the one called for by MSF, could only be used to manage licensed vaccines.  190819065038868  ""When the vaccine is licensed, this would be an appropriate mechanism for managing supply,"" Jasarevic said.  So far, more than 3,000 people have been infected by Ebola during the current outbreak in DRC.  Earlier this year, a handful of cases were confirmed in neighbouring Uganda after infected patients crossed the border.  All those affected either died or were sent back to DRC for specialised treatment.  Fears of a possible regional spread spiked again over the weekend after WHO criticised Tanzania for failing to share detailed information on suspected cases of the virus.  A toxic mix of deep-rooted insecurity in the region, widespread mistrust over the outbreak and response efforts have significantly hampered the bid to halt the spread of the virus. There have been regular attacks on medical teams trying to curtail the epidemic.  The worst ever outbreak of Ebola killed more than 11,300 people as it surged through West Africa between 2013-2016.  WHO was heavily criticised for its sluggish response to the crisis, which it repeatedly declined to declare a global emergency until the virus spread explosively.",en,diseas,,

The raid, days after a U.S. drone strike aimed at militants hiding among farmers killed 32 pine nut harvesters, showed how civilians have borne the brunt of a war that has re-intensified since U.S.-Taliban peace talks collapsed two weeks ago.  Afghan officials said a house being used by the Taliban to train suicide bombers was located adjacent to the brideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home that came under fire during Sunday nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commando assault in the Musa Qala area of Helmand in AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s south.  On Monday, 30-year-old Musa Qala resident Mohammad Salim carried bodies of cousins and relatives to a burial ground from a house decorated for his sister-in-lawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding.  Salim and two senior provincial government officials said 40 people, including 12 children, were killed at the wedding venue when Afghan forces swooped on the house used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to train male and female suicide bombers.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We were going to the brideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house for the henna ceremony, some of us were outside the home and some inside, (when) suddenly the battle began...We told the security forces that we were not members of the Taliban,Ã¢â‚¬Â Salim told Reuters.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“But both sides ended up killing civilians,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Another 13 wedding party participants were injured.  A senior Afghan Defence Ministry official said the raid was against Ã¢â‚¬Å“a foreign terrorist group actively engaged in organising terrorist attacksÃ¢â‚¬Â. He said government forces had also destroyed a large warehouse of militantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ equipment.  A second ministry official said a foreign militant detonated a suicide vest that killed him and others around him, including a woman, in response to the raid. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are aware that civilians were injured in the attack,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said they joined with Afghan security forces in the Helmand operation, conducting Ã¢â‚¬Å“precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and U.S. forces.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Leggett said most of those killed in the operation were struck by the gunfire of militants or from detonations of their explosives caches or suicide vests.  The Helmand governorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office said four senior Taliban commanders and the Taliban shadow governor of Musa Qala were among those killed. Twenty-two Taliban fighters in all were killed and 14 captured, the defence ministry said. Five Pakistanis and a Bangladeshi national were among those captured.

Reuters TV via REUTERS  WAR PICKS UP AGAIN  Bombing, air strikes and ground clashes between U.S.-backed government forces and militants have flared anew since the U.S.-Taliban negotiations fell apart, and ahead of a presidential election next week.  In the drone strike on Sept. 18 in the eastern province of Nangarhar, six local government officials said 32 pine nut harvesters were killed, 40 of whom were injured.  Malik Khyali, 62, a resident of Khogyani district in Nangarhar, said he lost a son in the drone strike and would not forgive those who carried it out as he knew of no militants hiding among labourers in the thickly wooded area.  Khyali said his son Madad Khan was employed as a cook who was serving meals to pine nut harvesters when a drone crashed into their tents. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I saw body parts being collected in several sacks...If you had seen them covered with blood and dirt, you would not be able to eat for days,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told Reuters.  The Taliban have been staging near-daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks in the run-up to the presidential election on Sept. 28 in order to discourage people from voting.  Last week a suicide bombing outside a hospital in Qalat in southern Afghanistan killed 39 people and injured 140. The Taliban said the target was a nearby building housing the regional governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intelligence department.  Farah Sami, a mother of four whose three-year-old son was critically wounded in that attack, said combatants were engaged in mindless violence to justify their existence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“All sides have been killing civilians. There is no hero or villain in this long war,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  The United States in 2001 sent forces to Afghanistan to oust Taliban leaders after they refused to hand over members of the al Qaeda militant group behind the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  Since then, U.S. forces have backed Afghan troops in war against the al Qaeda, Taliban and Islamic State groups that recruit Afghans and foreigners who mount attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and foreign forces.  Relatives of a wedding party victims wait outside the emergency hospital in Helmand, Afghanistan September 23, 2019, in this still image taken from a video. Reuters TV via REUTERS  A U.N. report released on June 30 said 717 civilian deaths were attributed to American and Afghan forces during the first six months of the year, compared with 531 blamed on militants.  Last week President Ashraf Ghani promised measures to reduce civilian casualties. On Monday he tweeted a call for Ã¢â‚¬Å“extra cautionÃ¢â‚¬Â in military operations, and ordered investigations.

Six gas canisters in the vehicle, which had been doused in diesel fuel, failed to explode when a cigarette was thrown at them, prosecutors said.  One of the women is accused of stabbing an officer in the shoulder after police traced them to a nearby apartment.  A defence lawyer said the women had been brainwashed on the internet.  The defendants, now aged between 22 and 42, are all Muslim converts.  They have been named as InÃƒÂ¨s Madani, Ornella Gilligmann, Sarah HervouÃƒÂ«t, Amel Sakaou and Samia Chalel. All of the women face terrorism charges, and four of them face life imprisonment.  What have police said about the bomb plot?  On 4 September 2016, police were alerted to an abandoned grey Peugeot 607 vehicle parked near the cathedral in one of Paris's busiest tourist locations.  The car's licence plates had been removed and its hazard lights were flashing.  It was found to contain five gas canisters, three jerry cans of diesel and a half-smoked cigarette. Some of the diesel fuel was used to douse the contents of the vehicle, but had failed to ignite from the cigarette, police said.  The discovery prompted an urgent police search.  The car was found to belong to Ms Madani's father and, according to court documents, fingerprint evidence was collected from inside.  Investigators said the bomb attempt would likely have been successful had it not been for ""the wrong choice of fuel"".  What are the allegations?  Based on the evidence collected, police launched a raid at a property on the outskirts of Paris.  During the raid, Ms HervouÃƒÂ«t reportedly stabbed an officer with a knife, and Ms Madani was shot in the leg while charging at another.  Police said they had found a handwritten pledge of allegiance to Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi inside Ms Madani's purse.  The women are all suspected of planning the bomb attack on the instructions of Rashid Kassim, a so-called handler for IS, who was based in Syria at the time.  Kassim, who is also named as a defendant and accused of directing the women ""remotely"", will be tried in absentia - he is thought to have been killed in a drone strike in Iraq in February 2017.  The women are believed to have been planning other attacks at the time, including striking a train station in the Paris area and targeting police.  The trial is expected to continue until 11 October.  France has suffered a series of attacks by jihadists who have declared allegiance to IS in recent years.  In November 2015, 130 people were killed and many more were injured in the co-ordinated suicide bombing and mass shootings around Paris.

Thailand has been on high alert since the outbreak of African swine fever among pigs in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, but it has yet to report an outbreak.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Earlier this month, the government ordered the culling of 200 pigs as preventative action after two pigs died mysteriously in the northern province of Chiang Rai, 20km from the Myanmar border.  Those two pigs turned out not to be infected, the agriculture official said.  The government has put 24 out of its 77 provinces on watch with restrictions on movement of pigs and wild boars, as well as its carcasses, semen or embryos for breeding.

""This is a precautionary measure for provinces that have large pigs population or are in border areas,"" Sorawit Thaneto, the director-general of the Department of Livestock Development said.  ""The results of the blood test from pigs culled in Chiang Rai also show that the pigs were not infected, but we continue to be on alert,"" he said.  Private business members of the Swine Raisers Association of Thailand have also jointly bought some 8,000 pigs raised in ""risk areas"" along the border to limit exposure to the disease in future stocks. Those pigs were not infected and have since been slaughtered and sold as meat.

A fifth person who was critically injured was being treated in hospital after what was the deadliest attack on police in France in years.  Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said that the attacker, a 45-year-old employee from the IT department in the police intelligence section, had killed 3 men and a woman before being killed in the courtyard of the square stone building on the Ile de la Cite.  Three of the dead were police officers and the 4 was an administrative assistant, he told reporters at the scene.  Speaking alongside him, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the attacker had been working for the police since 2003 and had ""never shown any behavior problems.""  The police were ""particularly stricken by this exceptionally grave incident,"" he said.  The police building was cordoned off after the lunchtime attack in the historic center of Paris, near Notre-Dame cathedral, and dozens of police and emergency vehicles converged at the scene.  President Emmanuel Macron also visited the police headquarters after the attack. Castener has postponed a planned trip to Greece and Turkey to deal with the incident.  Heitz confirmed that a murder investigation had been launched and that the man's home was being searched.  ""People were running everywhere, there was crying everywhere,"" said Emery Siamandi, an interpreter who was in the building when the attack happened.  ""I heard a shot, I gathered it was inside,"" he told Agence France-Presse. ""Moments later, I saw police officers crying. They were in a panic.""  High alert  One source said the employee was handicapped, without confirming reports that he was both deaf and mute.  So far, the country's anti-terror prosecutors have not been charged with investigating the attack.  Initial reports said investigators believed a workplace dispute could have sparked the incident.  ""Did he snap, or was there some other reason? It's still too early to say,"" Loic Travers, head of the Alliance Police union for the Paris region, told BFM television.  The attack comes amid growing tensions within the ranks of the police, who are stretched to the limit after a year of trying to contain weekly ""yellow vest"" anti-Macron demonstrations.  Thousands of police officers marched in Paris on Wednesday, October 2, for better working conditions, a rare protest that took place against the backdrop of a spike in suicides within their ranks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 52 so far this year.  France also remains on high alert after a succession of jihadist attacks since 2015, which have included both large synchronized assaults and isolated knife and gun attacks, and left more than 250 people dead.    In January 2015, two men armed with Kalashnikov rifles stormed the Paris offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people, including two police officers.  On November 15 that year, France was hit by the worst terror attacks in its history when Islamic State jihadists struck the national stadium, Paris cafes, and the Bataclan concert hall in a coordinated assault that left 130 people dead.  And in July 14, 2016 a Tunisian plowed a truck through a large crowd gathered for Bastille Day fireworks in the Mediterranean city of Nice. The attack killed 86 people and injured more than 400.

Washington's forces ""will not support or be involved in the [Turkish] operation"" and ""will no longer be in the immediate area"", White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.  It was not clear whether that meant the United States would withdraw its 1,000 or so troops completely from northern Syria.  ""Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria,"" said the statement.  A US official told Reuters news agency US forces had on Monday evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain in northeast Syria, along the Turkish border. Other US troops in the region were still in position for now, the official said.  The withdrawal marks a major shift in US policy and effectively abandons a US ally in the battle against ISIL, which took over swathes of Syria before being defeated a year ago.  US President Donald Trump on Monday defended the decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, saying it was too costly to keep supporting its allies.  ""The Kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades,"" Trump said in a series of tweets. ""Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.""  ....almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to..... Ã¢â‚¬â€ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019    190923094413989  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday his army was ready to launch operations against Kurdish fighters in Syria at any moment following the US announcement.  ""There is a phrase that we always say: we can come any night without warning,"" Erdogan told reporters in televised remarks. ""It is absolutely out of the question for us to further tolerate the threats from these terrorist groups.""  Syria's Kurds warned on Monday a Turkish military invasion would spark a major ISIL resurgence and vowed to battle Turkey's military.  Such an operation would reverse years of successful Kurdish-led operations to defeat the armed group and allow some of its surviving leaders to come out of hiding, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said in a statement.  The Kurdish-led force also denounced Washington for the pullout.  ""There were assurances from the United States of America that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region,"" SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel said in an interview with al-Hadath TV.  ""But the [US] statement today was a surprise and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the SDF.""  The Syrian-Kurdish force said in a statement it has lost 11,000 fighters in the war against ISIL.  'Great cost'  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday that Turkey would ""clean up terrorists"" in Syria.  ""We are determined to ensure our country's existence and security by clearing terrorists from this region,"" Cavusoglu wrote on Twitter.  ""From the start of the Syria war, we have supported that country's territorial integrity and will continue to do so from now on. We will contribute to bring serenity, peace and stability to Syria.""  The UN, meanwhile, said it was ""preparing for the worst"" in northeast Syria.  ""We don't know what is going to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Syria, Panos Moumtzis, said in Geneva, stressing there were ""a lot of unanswered questions"" about the consequences of the operation.  Grisham, the White House press secretary, said following a call between Trump and Erdogan, Turkey is to take custody of foreign fighters captured in the US-led campaign against ISIL, who have been held by Kurdish forces supported by the US.  ""The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer,"" the statement said.  France, Germany, and other European nations have refused US requests to take back nationals who fought for ISIL.  Turkey previously warned it would carry out military operations east of the Euphrates River, but put its plans on hold after agreeing with the US to create a ""safe zone"" inside Syria's northeastern border with Turkey, which would be cleared of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) armed group.  Kurdish forces bore the brunt of the ground campaign against ISIL but are considered ""terrorists"" by the Turkish government.  The White House statement was silent on what would happen to the Kurds.  Turkey is highly likely to wait until US soldiers have withdrawn from the area before launching an offensive, a senior Turkish official told Reuters.  He said the withdrawal of US troops from the planned area of operations could take one week and Ankara was highly likely to wait for this in order to avoid ""any accident"".  Syrian refugees  Ibrahim Kalin, Turkey's presidential spokesman, said on Monday the safe zone in northern Syria had two aims: to clear ""terrorist elements"" from the border and to return refugees safely to Syria.  Kalin said Turkey was not after territorial gain in any country.  ""Turkey is powerful and determined,"" he said, adding it will not allow ISIL to return ""in any shape and form"".  Turkey is home to 3.6 million Syrian refugees. Their presence has become a political issue as the country's economy struggles to emerge from recession.  After eight years of war in neighbouring Syria, Ankara and NATO ally Washington agreed to establish a zone along 480km (300 miles) of the border that Turkey wants to be 30km deep (19 miles).  Under the Turkish plan, up to two million Syrian refugees would be settled in the area that would be cleared of the YPG.  Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years. An estimated 40,000 people have been killed.  Ankara and Washington consider the PKK a ""terrorist"" group but they diverge on the issue of the YPG, which forms the core of US-backed Syrian forces against ISIL.  'Fill the vacuum'  Russia said on Monday that Syria's territorial integrity must be preserved. ""We hope that our Turkish colleagues would stick to this position in all situations,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.  Peskov reiterated Moscow's stance that all foreign military forces ""with illegal presence"" should leave Syria.  Since agreeing to set up the zone in northern Syria, Turkey has repeatedly warned of unilateral military action if efforts do not meet its expectations, saying it would not tolerate any attempts by the US to stall the process.  The ties between the allies have also been pressured over Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 defence missiles and the trial of local US consulate employees in Turkey.  Marwan Kabalan, from the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies, said Trump is desperate to secure any foreign policy success after failing on Afghanistan and Iran, and with fading progress on North Korea.  ""In order to pullout from Syria someone else must come in and fill the vacuum there so Turkey might be that party to do that mission. We have to look at the domestic needs of President Trump on one hand, and also the pressure the Turks are putting on the Trump administration,"" Kabalan told Al Jazeera.  He said the US' handling of Iran after the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure has changed perceptions about US military power in the Middle East.  ""Everybody is seeing the United States in a weak position right now since they were not willing to start any confrontation in the region,"" Kabalan added.",en,terrorattack,839,"['US', 'Syria', 'Turkey']"

But US President Donald Trump warned he would ""obliterate"" the NATO ally's economy if it took action in Syria that he considered ""off limits"" following his decision on Sunday to pull 50 American special forces troops from the border region.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The US move will leave its Kurdish-led partner forces in Syria vulnerable to an incursion by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), which brands them terrorists because of their links to Kurdish militants who have waged a long insurgency in Turkey.  ""The TSK will never tolerate the establishment of a terror corridor on our borders. All preparations for the operation have been completed,"" the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter early on Tuesday.  ""It is essential to establish a safe zone/peace corridor to contribute to our region's peace and stability, and for Syrians to achieve a safe life,"" it said.    Turkey does not appear ""as of now"" to have begun its expected incursion into northern Syria, a senior Trump administration official said on Monday.  Advertisement  Advertisement  A Reuters witness said there was no sign of military activity on Tuesday near the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria's Tel Abyad. Howitzers were positioned behind earth embankments on the Turkish side of the border, pointed towards Syria.    US forces evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain on Monday, a US official said.  Trump's warning on Turkey's economy appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out US forces. The decision drew criticism from Democrats and a rebuke from some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  ""As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)"" Trump tweeted.    ""RED FLAG""  His remarks met an angry response in Turkey, including from opposition party politicians such as Iyi Party leader Meral Aksener who said it was a day to put aside domestic politics.  ""Threatening Turkey's economy is a diplomatic catastrophe,"" she told her party's lawmakers in a speech in parliament. ""Today there is only one party and that is our red (Turkish) flag.""  ""The best response to this insolence is to go into the east of the Euphrates and break the terror corridor,"" she added.  The Kurdish-led forces, who have been Washington's most capable partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria, have denounced the major shift in US policy as ""stab in the back"".  Mustafa Bali, an official with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the continued Turkish military buildup on the border, together with information about further mobilization of Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, indicated that ""an attack is imminent and we expect it soon"".  ""Naturally our preparations are along the length of the border with Turkey and our forces are in a state of readiness,"" Bali told Reuters.  The United States expects Turkey to take responsibility for captive Islamic State fighters in northeastern Syria if Ankara's planned incursion seizes areas where the detained militants are held, a senior State Department official said.  The captives are held in SDF facilities south of a safe zone initially proposed by Turkey.  Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said overnight it was Turkey's fundamental right to take necessary measures for its national security against terrorism threats from Syria.  ""Turkey is determined to clear terrorists from the east of the Euphrates and protect its own security and survival while implementing a secure zone in order to achieve peace and stability,"" Aksoy said in a written statement.  Iran, President Bashar al-Assad's main regional ally, said it opposed any Turkish military operation in Syria.  President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey plans to resettle two million refugees in northern Syria and Turkish media has said the draft resettlement plan involves a 151 billion lira (US$26 billion) construction project. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.  The Trump administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, said 50 US troops in the region that Turkey has targeted would be redeployed elsewhere in Syria ""where they aren't in the crossfire."" The United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria.  Turkey's lira lost 2 per cent of its value against the dollar to hit its weakest level since early September but edged off its lows to 5.8195 on Tuesday. Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds also came under fresh pressure.

FILE PHOTO: An Indian security personnel stands guard on a deserted road during restrictions after scrapping of the special constitutional status for Kashmir by the Indian government, in Srinagar, August 23, 2019. REUTERS/Danish Ismail/File Photo  Even as the state government issued its statement on Monday night saying the travel advisory would be lifted, persistent security risks were manifest as a military official said a Ã¢â‚¬Å“terroristÃ¢â‚¬Â had been killed in a firefight the same evening.  The dead militant was a member of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and was the fifth militant to killed since the crackdown began, a police officer told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media.  The firefight took place in Pulwama district, some 25 kilometres (16 miles) south of Srinagar, the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s summer capital, and in the same area where in February a suicide bomber rammed a car into a bus carrying Indian paramilitary police.  Thousands of Indian tourists, pilgrims and workers had fled Jammu & Kashmir in early August after authorities issued a security alert over possible militant attacks by Pakistan-backed groups, assertions rejected by Islamabad.  Telephone and internet services were suspended and public movements restricted in some areas to prevent protests hours before India announced it had revoked the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special status.  Some curbs have since been lifted. On Sunday, some 15 members of the main National Conference party were allowed to meet two senior leaders detained in the crackdown.  However, mobile and internet services are largely still blocked in the Kashmir valley.  Kashmir touts itself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paradise on EarthÃ¢â‚¬Â and is known for its mountains, glaciers and Dal Lake, a favourite destination centuries ago for Mughal emperors escaping the summer heat of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plains.  However, Britain and other countries still have advisories in place discouraging their citizens from travelling to Jammu and Kashmir, where a grenade attack injured 10 people on the weekend.  The Ã¢â‚¬Å“terroristÃ¢â‚¬Â killed on Monday night died during a Ã¢â‚¬Å“firefightÃ¢â‚¬Â after the army set up checkpoints and laid ambushes in orchards, a military official said, declining to be named.  Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, and both claim the territory in full. More than 40,000 people have been killed in an insurgency in the Indian part of Kashmir since 1989.  Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government says scrapping stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special status was necessary to integrate it fully into the rest of India and spur development. Critics say the decision will alienate people further and fuel armed resistance.

Dozens of vehicles made up a large convoy seen in the Turkish town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Meanwhile, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Turkish forces were attacking near the border.  ""The Turkish military is shelling one of our points on #SereKaniye Border with Turkey. "" the SDF said in a tweet late Tuesday, referencing the key border town of Ras al-Ain.  It was one of the places from which US troops withdrew from on Monday, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""There were no injuries to our forces. We didn't respond to this unprovoked attack. We are prepared to defend the people and the people of NE #Syria,"" the SDF said.  Border skirmishes between Turkish and Kurdish forces have taken place before, and there was no indication the latest reported shelling was part of a broader offensive.  LONG-PLANNED ATTACK  Trump has blown hot and cold since a surprise announcement on Sunday that Washington was pulling back 50 to 100 ""special operators"" from Syria's northern frontier.  The troops had served as a buffer preventing a long-planned attack by the Turkish military against Kurdish forces, who were crucial in the years-long campaign to defeat the Islamic State group but are viewed as ""terrorists"" by Ankara.  After appearing to give a green light to the Turkish invasion on Sunday, he later threatened to ""obliterate"" Turkey's economy if it went too far.  But he also gave a warm account of Turkey in other tweets and announced that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would visit Washington on Nov 13.  ""So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States,"" he said.  Ankara had already brushed aside Trump's warnings, with Vice-President Fuat Oktay saying: ""Turkey is not a country that will act according to threats.""  Turkey has always pushed hard against US support for Kurdish forces in Syria due to their links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has fought a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.  Its defence ministry tweeted that preparations for an offensive in northern Syria have been ""completed"".  KURDS HAVE BEEN 'TOSSED ASIDE'  Meanwhile, the Syrian government has welcomed the upheaval, spying an opportunity to bring the country's Kurds back into its fold.  The Kurds have been ""tossed aside"" by Washington, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad told the pro-government Al-Watan newspaper.  Trump rejected that interpretation, tweeting: ""We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.""  Britain said it was ""deeply concerned"" by Turkey's plans to attack Kurdish fighters, who lead the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).  The SDF says it lost some 11,000 fighters as the main frontline force against the Islamic State group.  A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said London had been ""consistently clear with Turkey that unilateral military action must be avoided as it would destabilise the region"".  Iran, a key backer of the Syrian government, also opposed a Turkish incursion, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urging ""respect for Syria's territorial integrity"" in a call to Ankara.  'SAFE ZONE'  Russia's security council said it was important to avoid hindering the peace process in Syria.  Turkey says it wants to establish a ""safe zone"" on the Syrian side of the border where it could send back some of the 3.6 million refugees from the eight-year civil war.  Erdogan said on Monday that the operation into Syria could ""come any night without warning"".  Kurds argue that Ankara's goal is to dilute their dominance in the region with an influx of mostly Sunni Arab refugees now living in Turkey.  Trump has faced a barrage of criticism, including from close allies in Washington, for appearing to leave the Kurds to their fate.  Many officials were caught off-guard, with Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman warning Turkey of destabilising blowback to the region if it invades.  A Turkish attack also raises the spectre of what will happen to some 10,000 Islamic State group fighters currently being held in Kurdish detention centres.  Around 2,000 of them are IS ""foreign fighters"", and Trump assailed US allies in Europe for not taking back their nationals.  If they escape or are released, they could reconstitute IS, less than one year after it was defeated and its ""caliphate"" disintegrated.  Trump declared that it would be the responsibility of Turkey and other countries to deal with IS prisoners.  ",en,terrorattack,839,"['Turkey', 'Syria']"

Badran Jia Kurd's comments to Reuters reflect the predicament facing Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria following a partial withdrawal of US troops who have effectively shielded the area from Turkish attack.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The United States withdrew 50 American special forces from a section of the Turkish border on Monday, opening the way for Turkey to stage a long-threatened incursion against Syrian Kurdish-led forces that it deems as terrorists.  The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has described the US decision as ""a stab in the back"".  Spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF has been a major part of the US-led campaign against Islamic State.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""If America vacates the area and especially the border area for certain we, as a self administration and as the SDF, will be forced to study all the available options,"" Jia Kurd told Reuters.  ""At that time we may hold talks with Damascus or the Russian side to fill the void or block the Turkish attack, so this may develop and there could be meetings and contacts in case of a vacuum,"" he said.  Turkey said on Tuesday it had completed preparations for a military operation in the northeast. It views the YPG as a terrorist organisation because of its links to Kurdish militants who have waged a long insurgency in Turkey.  The Kurdish-led administration found itself in a similar position in late 2018 when President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw US forces from Syria. The SDF held talks in Damascus that broke down without progress.  Despite enmity between Syrian Kurds and Damascus, the result of years of systematic persecution of Kurds under the rule of the Baathist government, the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups have seldom fought the Syrian government during the war.  While the Syrian rebellion has fought to topple President Bashar al-Assad, the YPG says its priority is to maintain regional autonomy as part of the Syrian state.  Damascus however is loathe to cede the Kurds the level of autonomy they seek. The government earlier this year threatened the US-backed Kurdish forces with military defeat if they did not agree to a return of state authority.  ",en,terrorattack,,

The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Washington's main ally in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) group, have denounced the United States's move as a ""stab in the back"" and pledged to defend the area from a Turkish assault ""at all costs"".  On Tuesday, the Turkish defence ministry said it was ready to launch its operation aimed at creating a ""safe zone"" to create the conditions needed for the return of Syrian refugees and drive the Kurdish fighters, who it considers ""terrorists"", away from the border area.  This came as SDF Commander Mazlum Abdi told NBC News that his forces tasked with securing the ISIL prisoners were leaving for the border to prepare for a battle against the Turkish army.  Watching over ISIL captives - estimated at at least 10,000 - was ""a second priority"", he told the US-based network.  Trump's move was widely criticised in the US, with a group of bipartisan legislators calling it a ""misguided and catastrophic blow to our national interests"".  ""These Kurdish soldiers are the first line of defence in maintaining the gains we have made against ISIS; if Turkey attacks these Kurdish soldiers, there is a grave risk that the ISIS fighters they guard will escape and return to the battlefield,"" the group said in a statement.  'Huge burden'  The SDF has long called for the international community to take the prisoners, who include 2,000 foreign fighters, off its hands, saying it does not have the capacity to prosecute the captives or hold them in prison long term.  SDF officials say there are 10 such detention facilities spread across the vast region the groups controls east of the Euphrates River. Described by some as ""pop-up prisons"", the facilities are housed in former schools and old government buildings, including in Raqqa, Deir Az Zor and Hasakah provinces. Up to 70,000 women and children, relatives of ISIL fighters, are also being held at the sprawling al-Hol camp, according to the United Nations.  Mutlu Civiroglu, an analyst based in Washington, DC, said there was ""no doubt"" ISIL would take advantage of the situation created by a Turkish operation.  191007141408983  While the US says the ISIL captives are now Turkey's responsibility, Civiroglu said Ankara may not be equipped to deal with the armed group's prisoners in SDF prisons or a resurgence in attacks.  ""It's a huge burden for Turkey,"" he said. ""More or less the ISIS detainees are under control [right now], but it's going to be very hard [for Turkey] to control these people. Turkey does not have the advantage of the Kurds and the local groups Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ because it's unfamiliar territory for them.""  Brett McGurk, a former US presidential envoy to the anti-ISIL coalition, echoed the same sentiment in a Twitter post. ""Turkey has neither the intent, desire nor capacity to manage the 60k [60,000] detainees in al-Hol camp,"" he said.  A general view of al-Hol displacement camp in Hasaka governorate [File: Ali Hashisho/ Reuters]  But Umit Yalcin, Turkish ambassador to the UK, told Sky News on Tuesday Turkey ""can deal with"" ISIL captives.  ""We will handle this issue with our allies in cooperation ... We have that capacity and capability,"" he said.  'Gift for ISIL'  The SDF has warned that ISIL remains a threat in the region. The Kurdish YPG-led forces warned on Monday a possible Turkish attack would ""reverse the successful effort to defeat ISIS"". In a Twitter post, it also said that such a development would lead to the ""return of ISIS leaders who are hidden in the desert"" and attempts at freeing the prisoners.  On Sunday, the SDF announced capturing an ISIL commander, while an August report by the US Department of Defense Inspector General Glenn Fine said the armed group ""has activated resurgent cells in areas controlled by the SDF"" to conduct attacks.  ""They (ISIL) thrive on the management of chaos and so for them, it's going to be quite a gift,"" said Robert Wesley, president of the Terrorism Research Initiative, referring to a potential confrontation between Turkey and SDF.  ""Especially if you have a movement by the Assad regime north of the river, especially into some of the oil areas,"" he said, referring to the likelihood Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces may use a Turkish offensive to reclaim the oil-rich Deir Az Zor province from the SDF.  It is unclear how many of the ISIL prisons are located in the region Turkey intends to create its ""safe zone"", Wesley said. Turkish officials have said the area would stretch 30km from the country's border into Syria.  But Wesley said Turkey may extend that zone if it wants to push back the Kurdish forces.  ""Turkey will have to go deeper into the area to inflict a heavier defeat, or otherwise have to content themselves with a smaller zone of control,"" he said.  Wesley went on to urge European countries to take action on the European ISIL prisoners, which according to the SDF number around 1,000. European countries have refused to do so previously, and some have passed laws stripping citizenship from ISIL fighters who are dual nationals.  ""This is a big threat Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ nothing has changed, Europeans have decided they'd rather pass the buck onto the US and the SDF and we're in the same position we were before,"" Wesley said.  ""It's a good opportunity for them, [to say to] Turkey and the US, 'if you stay in the game here, if you maintain stability in the north we're going to provide some additional assistance with the detention facilities there, and become more actively involved'.""  Yalcin, the Turkish ambassador, meanwhile urged countries to repatriate suspected ISIL fighters for trial at home. He told Sky News ""the ideal situation"" would be for states ""to take those people back to their own countries and they can bring them justice, take them to court or rehabilitate them"".  For his part, Trump, who has also been pressing European countries to take back suspected fighters, said the US would not take in any ISIL fighters.  ""Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their 'neighborhood',"" he said on Twitter.  ""They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7,000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!""",en,terrorattack,,

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Early indications show that two people were killed in Halle. Several shots were fired,Ã¢â‚¬Â said police on Twitter, urging residents in the area to stay indoors.  Police had earlier said the Ã¢â‚¬Å“perpetrators fled in a carÃ¢â‚¬Â before saying later that one suspect had been caught.  It was not immediately clear whether there were other assailants.  The central train station has been closed while the area is under lockdown, rail company Deutsche Bahn said.  According to Bild daily, the shooting took place in front of a synagogue in the Paulus district, and a hand grenade was also flung into a Jewish cemetery. Police could not be reached immediately for confirmation.  Jews around the world were marking Yom Kippur, one of the holiest days in the Jewish calendar, on Wednesday.  An eyewitness, Konrad Roesler, told news channel NTV he was in a Turkish restaurant about 600 metres away from the synagogue when Ã¢â‚¬Å“a man wearing a helmet and military uniformÃ¢â‚¬Â flung a hand grenade at the store.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The grenade hit the door and exploded,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“(The attacker) shot at least once in the shop, the man behind me must be dead.

LuebckeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killing has deeply shaken Germany, raising questions about whether it has failed to take seriously a rising threat from right-wing extremists.  Investigators have been probing the extent of suspect Stephan ErnstÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neo-Nazi ties and whether he had links to the far-right militant cell National Socialist Underground (NSU).  Interior Minister Horst Seehofer last month warned of the rising danger of the militant far right, calling it Ã¢â‚¬Å“as big a threat as radical IslamismÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Seehofer said that police had uncovered 1,091 weapons including firearms and explosives during probes of crimes linked to the far right last year, far more than in 2017 when 676 were found.  At the same time, Germany has also been on high alert following several militant attacks in recent years claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.",en,terrorattack,,

More:  The Turkish military will to team up with the rebel FSA, with which it worked previously in two other operations in northern Syria in recent years.  191008114825095  ""The Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army [FSA], will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly,"" Fahrettin Altun said in a Washington Post column published on Wednesday.  ""Turkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralise a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,"" he wrote.  Altun added fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) - an armed group Turkey considers a ""terrorist"" organisation - in Syria could either defect or Ankara would have to ""stop them from disrupting"" Turkey's struggle against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group.  Turkey has said it intends to create a ""safe zone"" in order to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil, but the scheme has alarmed some Western allies and military analysts as much as the risks posed by the military operation itself.  Syria, meanwhile, is determined to confront any Turkish aggression ""by all legitimate means"", state media cited a foreign ministry source as saying on Wednesday.  The government ""is ready to embrace its prodigal sons if they return to their senses"", it added, an apparent reference to Syrian Kurdish authorities who hold the northeast.  'Imminent attack'  On Wednesday, Turkey's Defence Minister Hulusi Akar told state-run Anadolu news agency that Turkey's preparations and deployments for its planned military offensive are continuing.  The defence ministry on Tuesday said ""all preparations for the operation"" had been completed. Turkish troops have been gathering on Turkey's side of the border since Monday night.  The US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Turkish forces were attacking near the border.  ""The Turkish military is shelling one of our points on #SereKaniye Border with Turkey,"" the SDF said in a tweet late on Tuesday, referencing the key border town of Ras al-Ain. No injuries were reported.  191008131745495  It was one of the places from which US troops withdrew on Monday, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Meanwhile, US officials, who were not authorised to discuss details of military intelligence, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that there are between 5,000 and 10,000 Turkish troops along the border, apparently ready to go.  The officials said they expect the Turks to begin with air raids, followed by barrages from heavy artillery along the border and the movement of ground troops into Syria.  Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Akcakale along Turkey's border with Syria, said: ""All evidence suggests that the operation could be imminent.""  ""Last night, we passed dozens of military vehicles heading in this direction - APCs [armoured personnel carriers], what we believe to be trucks carrying ammunition, and flatbed trucks transporting tanks,"" he said.  Stratford said buses of Free Syrian Army fighters were also transported from northern Aleppo in Syria across the border into Turkey on Tuesday.  ""They are staying at a camp close by, and it's understood they will be joining the Turks in any sort of ground force operation,"" he added.  Civilians already beleaguered by eight years of conflict are concerned.  ""If war erupts, people will be vulnerable and displaced. Where should we go? You ask anyone they say we are not leaving. But eventually, we will be displaced,"" Summaiyah Mohammed, a Kurdish citizen in northern Syria, told Kurdish broadcaster Rudaw.  Mass prison break?  Jonathan Schanzer, a Syria scholar at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said even a limited Turkish incursion into northern Syria could quickly escalate.  ""The president is doubling down on this - seems to be reversing course,"" Schanzer told AP. ""He's trying to convey to the American people that he's made the right decision. Of course, Erdogan is going to see this as a green light.""  191008163138301  Tamara Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy, also pointed out a frightening potential knock-on effect if Turkey is allowed to attack the Kurds: a mass prison break by ISIL detainees.  Currently, militia members are guarding a series of prisons in Syria holding thousands of ISIL fighters.  Those guards would presumably rush to the front lines if their comrades faced the threat of the Turkish military machine.  ""The only foreign policy issue that Americans really care about is terrorism and the fear of terrorism,"" Wittes told AP. ""The fear of ISIS 3.0 is very tangible and something that speaks to Americans.""",en,terrorattack,,

His comments on Twitter came as Turkey launched a long-threatened military operation in northeast Syria to remove Kurdish-led forces from the border area and create a ""safe zone"" to resettle millions of Syrian refugees.  Turkey had been poised to advance into northeast Syria since US troops began vacating the area on Sunday in an abrupt policy shift by Trump.  ""Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,"" Trump said in a series of morning tweets. ""The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!""  But many within Trump's own party ramped up their criticism of his decision on Wednesday, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham vowing to lead the ""effort in Congress to make [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan pay a heavy price"".  ""Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration. This move ensures the re-emergence of ISIS,"" Graham said, referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS).  191008131745495  In withdrawing its troops from the area, the US effectively abandoned the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), its main ally in the battle against ISIL.  The SDF is led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey considers a ""terrorist"" group.  Trump appeared to try to assuage his critics later on Wednesday, saying the US does not ""endorse"" Turkey's operation and has made it clear that it is a ""bad idea"".  The US president added that Turkey has ""committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place"" and that the US ""will hold [Ankara] accountable to this commitment.  'Biggest mistake of Trump's presidency'  Prior to Turkey's official launch of its operation, Graham had called Trump's decision a ""disaster in the making"" and said that he and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen would introduce legislation calling for sanctions against Ankara if Turkey launched an operation in northeast Syria. He also said they would call for Turkey's ""suspension from NATO if they [attacked] Kurdish forces who assisted the US in the destruction of ISIS Caliphate"".  191008232132422  Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, Graham said that if Trump ""follows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency"". Graham did not mention the possible sanctions resolution on Wednesday.  Graham's criticism has been echoed by others within the party, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said ""a precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup"".  Trump maintains that he campaigned on bringing American troops home.  ""GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!"" the US president tweeted early on Wednesday morning.  He added, ""Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!""  But the US military has kept a decades-long focus on the Middle East as part of a strategy of stopping or minimising security threats before they spread to American and allied shores.  191008144704723  As a further sign that the military does not share Trump's view that the fight against the armed group is over, a press release on Wednesday by the US-led military coalition combating ISIL highlighted recent battlefield gains. It concluded by saying that ""removing"" ISIL fighters and weapons ""remains a top priority"" as the group ""continues to plot attacks against innocent civilians and our partners throughout Iraq and northeast Syria"".  The US has about 1,000 troops in Syria and about 5,200 in neighbouring Iraq.  Trump has long criticised President George W Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003, but the subsequent rise of armed groups like ISIL has convinced many national security officials, and members of Congress that a precipitous US troop withdrawal from the region would leave the US and its allies even more vulnerable.  Meanwhile, Trump announced on Tuesday that he and Erdogan will meet at the White House on November 13.",en,terrorattack,839,['Syria']

FILE PHOTO: Badran Jia Kurd, top Kurdish official, talks during an interview with Reuters in Qamishli, Syria March 11, 2019. Picture taken March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Issam Abdallah/File Photo  Badran Jia Kurd told Reuters the number of security forces guarding the militants will dwindle as Turkish forces step up an offensive they launched at the border on Wednesday. U.S. officials have worried Islamic State detainees would seize on such an opportunity for a prison break.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold thousands of the militants in prisons and tens of thousands of their relatives in camps, many of them foreigners. With the Kurdish YPG militia at its forefront, the SDF defeated jihadists across much of north and east Syria with U.S. air and ground support.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This attack will definitely reduce and weaken the guarding system for those Daesh militants in the prisons,Ã¢â‚¬Â Jia Kurd said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This could lead to their escape or to behaviours that may get out of the control of the security forces,Ã¢â‚¬Â added Jia Kurd, adviser to the Kurdish-led authority in the SDF region.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The number of forces guarding the prisons is reduced the more the battles intensify. This poses a grave danger.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The SDF says it has 70,000 foreigners in custody from around 60 nationalities, including militants, their wives and children, on top of thousands of detained Syrian and Iraqi fighters.  Kurdish leaders have said they do not have the resources to bear this burden alone, pleading with governments to take their citizens back but most have turned a blind eye. U.S. officials have said as many as around 2,000 of the Islamic State militants in detention are foreigners.  A U.S. official said the U.S. military took custody on Wednesday of two high-profile British Islamic State militants that the SDF was holding and moved them out of Syria. The official said the individuals were being held in a secure location but offered no further details.  TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offensive into northeast Syria kicked off days after U.S. forces withdrew from part of the border, opening up a dangerous new phase in SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than eight-year-old conflict.  TURKEY SEEKS TO ASSUAGE CONCERNS  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan sought to assuage concerns from world powers on Thursday that his operation runs the risk of an Islamic State jail break amid the chaos. He said he guaranteed jihadists will not have a presence in northeast Syria after Turkey completes its offensive.  The border strip which U.S. forces vacated this week, and which is believed to be the focus of AnkaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incursion, is a nearly 100-km (62-mile) stretch between the Syrian towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ain. It does not include prisons.  A diplomat following Syria said the SDF was unlikely to release prisoners on purpose.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rule out unrest in the IDP (Internally displaced persons) camps to make life more difficult for the SDF, or ISIS fighters trying to bust people out...We are watching it closely, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think they will open the gates. That is not their style and would be self defeating,Ã¢â‚¬Â the diplomat said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SDF know how important this issue is to the international community - and some of the reports coming out are trying to create an international feeling of crisis around the issue of the ISIS detainees and their families.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Human Rights Watch said this week the SDF has held thousands of men and boys in severely overcrowded schools and other buildings on charges of having joined Islamic State. It said the Turkish incursion highlights the urgent need for countries to repatriate their citizens.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“No one is accepting responsibility for them,Ã¢â‚¬Â the U.S.-based rights group said, calling for urgently improving prison conditions and ensuring lawful detention.  Kurdish-led authorities accused Turkey of bombing a prison holding foreign jihadists in Qamishli city on Wednesday night. Ankara has yet to respond to the accusation.  The SDF has halted operations against Islamic State because of the Turkish offensive, two U.S. officials and a Kurdish source said.

At least 23 fighters with the SDF and six fighters with a Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group had been killed, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war.  NATO member Turkey says the operation is necessary for border security against the YPG militia, which it designates a terrorist group because of ties to militants who have waged a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.  Ankara has also said it intends to create a ""safe zone"" for the return of millions of refugees to Syria.  ISLAMIC STATE CAPTIVES  The SDF have been the main allies of US forces on the ground in the battle against Islamic State (IS) since 2014. They have been holding thousands of captured IS fighters in prisons and tens of thousands of their relatives in detention.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for an emergency meeting of the coalition of more than 30 countries created to fight Islamic State.  SDF forces were still in control of all prisons with Islamic State captives, a senior US State Department official said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday.  The United States has received a high-level commitment from Turkey on taking responsibility for Islamic State captives but had not yet had detailed discussions, the official said.

(Photo: Security Official/Handout via REUTERS)  US lawmakers have said Trump gave Erdogan the green light to go into Syria but the official disputed that. ""We gave them a very clear red light, I've been involved in those red lights and I know the president did that on Sunday,"" the official said.    The SDF said Turkish air strikes and shelling had killed nine civilians. In apparent retaliation by Kurdish-led forces, six people including a 9-month-old baby were killed by mortar fire into Turkish towns, Turkish officials said.  The International Rescue Committee aid group said 64,000 people in Syria have fled since the campaign began. The towns of Ras al Ain and Darbasiya, some 60 km to the east, were largely deserted.  The Observatory said Turkish forces seized two villages near Ras al Ain and five near Tel Abyad. A Syrian rebel forces spokesman said the towns were surrounded after fighters seized the villages around them.  Trump has faced rare criticism from senior figures in his Republican Party who accuse him of deserting US allies.  US Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who usually backs Trump, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the US troop withdrawal. He unveiled a framework for sanctions on Turkey with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey would retaliate against any measure taken against it.

But while Ankara said its forces had seized the centre of Ras al Ain this has been disputed by Syrian Kurdish forces.  The capture of the town would be Turkey's most significant gain since its invasion began on Wednesday.  Image: The UN has estimated more than 100,000 people have been forced to flee the fighting  Ankara launched its ground and air offensive into northern Syria after Donald Trump cleared the way by pulling back American forces from the area, who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against Islamic State (IS).  Washington has subsequently demanded Turkey halt its offensive, which has seen American forces come under artillery fire, warning the regime that it was causing ""great harm"" to ties and could face sanctions.  Advertisement  There has been international condemnation of the offensive, with accusations of ethnic cleansing and fears about the humanitarian cost.  The UN has estimated more than 100,000 people have been forced to flee the fighting.  Anger and grief in Turkey's Syria offensive  The UK's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said Turkey's military assault weakens the fight against IS and risks deepening the plight of civilians in the war-ravaged region.  He argued that Ankara must show ""maximum restraint"" as the air and ground offensive enters its fourth day.  But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed the mounting criticism insisting that Turkey ""will not stop it, no matter what anyone says"".  Meanwhile, IS have moved to exploit the conflict, exploding a car bomb at a prison in the city of Hasaka in northeastern Syria, in a bid to breakout detained militants.  The blast forced Kurdish-led security forces to send reinforcements to prevent an escape.  A Kurdish official has already warned that the Turkish offensive has weakened its ability to secure prisoners.  In Ras al Ain, one of two Syrian border towns targeted in the offensive, thick plumes of smoke could be seen amid the sound of gunfire and warplanes flying overhead.  It was reported to be quieter at Tel Abyad, the operation's other main target some 75 miles (120km) to the west, with only occasional shelling heard.  :: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker  Earlier, Turkish-backed Syrian rebels said they had cut the road which connects Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad and had captured 18 villages since the operation began.  The Turkish defence ministry tweeted: ""Ras al Ain's residential centre has been taken under control through the successful operations in the east of the Euphrates (river).""  But the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) denied this and said while Turkish-backed forces had entered one neighbourhood, a counter-attack was under way.  Sky News foreign affairs editor Deborah Haynes, who is in Ceylanpinar, said Ras al Ain had been ""a signficant focus of Turkish firepower"".  ""In the past hour we've heard Turkish jets overhead. They are high up above us - we can't see them, just hear them,"" she added.  Turkey says it aims to push back Syrian Kurdish forces, which it considers terrorists its links to a decades-long Kurdish insurgency within its own borders.  But the military action has raised concerns about the threat of a an IS resurgence.  The SDF was the main US ally in the fight against IS, losing 11,000 fighters in the nearly five-year battle against the extremists.",en,terrorattack,839,"['Turkey', 'Ras']"

Turkey pursued its four-day-old, cross-border offensive against a Syrian Kurdish militia despite an outcry from the United States and European Union and warnings of possible sanctions unless Ankara called off its attack.  US President Donald Trump's administration said Turkey's incursion was causing ""great harm"" in relations with its NATO ally. Other NATO allies Germany and France said they were banning weapons exports to Turkey.  The head of the Arab League denounced the operation and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to express his ""grave concern"" about the offensive.  Ankara began its onslaught against the YPG militia, which it says is a terrorist group backing Kurdish rebels in Turkey, after Trump withdrew some US troops there to support Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State.  The assault has raised international alarm over its mass displacement of civilians and the possibility of Islamic State militants escaping from Kurdish prisons leading to a revival of the jihadist group's insurgency in Syria.  The Kurdish-led administration in Syria's northeast said nearly 200,000 people had been uprooted so far by the fighting, while the UN World Food Programme said more than 100,000 had left Ras al Ain and the town of Tel Abyad.  Turkey's stated objective is to set up a ""safe zone"" inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting.  Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault.

""The (Syrian rebel) National Army took control of (Ras al Ain) town centre this morning,"" a senior Turkish security official said, referring to Ankara-backed rebels. ""Inspections are being conducted in residential areas.  Mine and booby trap searches are being carried out."" Marvan Qamishlo, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG comprises the main fighting element, said they had carried out only a ""tactical retreat"" in Ras al Ain in response to hours of heavy Turkish bombardment.  ""Now the SDF's attack has started and there are very fierce clashes,"" Qamishlo told Reuters. ""The clashes are continuing in the industrial district,"" the part of Ras al Ain closest to the border.  Speaking as night fell Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office, said the SDF remained in control inside Ras al Ain.  The senior Turkish official said ""nearly all"" YPG forces had fled south from Ras al Ain. Turkish artillery continued to shell parts of the town, a Reuters reporter said.  The SDF holds most of the northern Syrian territory that once made up Islamic State's ""caliphate"" in the country, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.  The SDF accused Turkey-backed rebel fighters of killing a Kurdish politician in a road ambush on Saturday. The rebel force denied it, saying it had not advanced that far.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation which reports on the war, said Turkey-backed groups had killed nine civilians on the road, including Hervin Khalaf, co-chair of the secular Future Syria Party.  TURKEY SEEKS 'SAFE ZONE'  In the latest international censure of Turkey's incursion, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit called it an ""invasion of an Arab state's land and an aggression on its sovereignty"".  Iraq, the current president of the League, said the offensive ""will exacerbate humanitarian crises, increase the suffering of the Syrian people and strengthen the ability of terrorists to reorganise their remnants.""  Turkey dismissed the criticism, saying Syrian Arabs had been the biggest victims of the YPG, which it said had driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in areas it controls.  The foreign ministry said that by accusing Turkey, rather than a ""terrorist organisation that threatens the territorial integrity of Syria"", the League was betraying the Arab world.

NO GERMAN OR FRENCH WEAPONS  Germany and France halted arms exports to Turkey that could be used by Turkish forces in Syria.  The French foreign and defence ministries said in a joint statement that European Union foreign ministers would coordinate their position on Monday at a meeting in Luxembourg.  Erdogan has dismissed mounting international condemnation of the operation and said on Friday evening that Turkey ""will not stop it, no matter what anyone says"".  The Turkish-backed National Army said earlier they had cut a road linking Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, the two main targets of Ankara's offensive, and had captured 18 villages since the operation began.  Seventy-four Kurdish-led fighters, 49 Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and 30 civilians have been killed in the fighting, according to the Observatory.  In Turkey, 18 civilians have been killed in cross-border bombardment, Turkish media and officials say. They included eight people in a mortar and rocket attack on the border town of Nusaybin, the local governor's office said.  Turkey said 459 YPG militants had been ""neutralised"" since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.  FEARS OF ISLAMIC STATE REVIVAL  Overnight a car bomb exploded outside a prison in Hasaka in northeast Syria, causing serious damage but no casualties, a statement from security forces in the region said. It did not say if any Islamic State prisoners there had escaped.  The SDF's Qamishlo said the attack was carried out by IS sleeper cells and another senior SDF official said the Turkish assault had given new life to the jihadist group.  ""The Turkish invasion is no longer threatening the revival of Daesh (Islamic State), rather it has revived it and activated its cells in Qamishli and Hasaka and all the other areas,"" SDF official Redur Xelil said, noting car bombs in each of the cities in the last day.  He said the SDF was now fighting on two fronts - continuing to cooperate with the US-led coalition against Islamic State while also confronting the Turkish armed forces.  In its first big attack since the assault began, IS claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb on Friday in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area.  Five IS militants fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.",en,terrorattack,,

France has been hit by a wave of terror attacks since 2015, many claimed or inspired by the Islamic State group, and has expressed concerns that a Turkish assault on Kurdish forces at the helm of the fight against IS in Syria would bolster the radicals.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Kurdish authorities and foreign powers have warned repeatedly that fighting could allow extremists to break out of captivity.  ""Of course we are worried about what could happen and that is why we want Turkey ... to end"" the assault ""as quickly as possible"", government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told France 3 television.  She was reacting to the Kurdish administration in northern Syria announcing that Turkish bombardment near a displaced people's camp had caused nearly 800 relatives of IS members to flee.  Kurdish forces also claimed that five IS terrorists escaped on Friday from a prison in the northeast.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""I do not know, today, who exactly the people are who fled from the camp; it has been a worry for France since the beginning of this armed intervention,"" said Ndiaye.  Families of militants in Syria, meanwhile, urged the government on Sunday to repatriate French-born fighters and their children, following news of the breakout.  A grouping calling itself the ""Collective of Unified Families"" urged Paris in a statement Sunday ""to urgently repatriate the innocent French children trapped in the war in Syria, and for security reasons ... to repatriate their parents as well.""  France, which accounts for the largest number of European militants in Syria, insists that militants fighting abroad must be tried in the country where they are apprehended but has recently allowed back a handful of adults and several children of militants.  Paris maintains it will consider the files of citizens held in northeastern Syria on a case-by-case basis, and Ndiaye said Sunday the policy remains unchanged.  Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has referred to French-born IS fighters as ""enemies"" of the nation.  ""HUMANITARIAN CRISIS""  The families collective urged the government to act ""before the situation gets worse, before innocent children are killed or injured ... before the foreign prisoners disperse in the Syrian chaos"".  Fighting has engulfed northern Syria since Wednesday when Ankara launched a long-threatened offensive against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it considers ""terrorists"" linked to insurgents in Turkey.  US President Donald Trump has been accused of abandoning a loyal ally in the fight against IS after ordering American troops to pull back from the border.  Ndiaye said that in a call to Trump on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron had pressed upon him France's concerns about the Turkish offensive, and underlined the need to prevent a resurgence of IS in the region.  France and Germany on Saturday suspended arms exports to Turkey.  Ndiaye said there were also fears for a ""serious humanitarian crisis"" in Syria, where the number of people fleeing has soared to 130,000.  Following protests by thousands of members of France's Kurdish community on Saturday, some 300 gathered Sunday in the southern city of Toulouse to denounce Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as an ""assassin"" and accuse Europe of doing little to nothing.  ""If your life is peaceful, if you can sleep well at night, if there are no more attacks around you, it is thanks to the battle of the Kurds"" against IS, said the group's spokesman Nafiye Atac.

3455862,cnn,Eliza Mackintosh Helen Regan,"Syria: Kurdish forces facing Turkish onslaught strike deal with Assad, in major shift",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_meast/~3/ZBVDvuyh07M/index.html,,15/10/2019 3:24,"(CNN) Abandoned by the United States and facing a deepening Turkish military offensive , Kurdish forces near the northern Syrian border have struck a deal with the Syrian government, marking a major shift in the country's eight-year war.  On Monday, Syrian troops were reportedly advancing north towards the border to confront Turkish forces, returning for the first time in years to a region where the Kurds had established relative autonomy, and further solidifying Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's grip on the country.  The agreement between Damascus and the Kurds comes as US President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of all remaining American forces out of northern Syria. The move signals a departure from long-standing US counter-terrorism strategy in Syria, which hinged on a close partnership with Kurdish-led forces to combat ISIS.  In discontinuing that approach, the Trump administration has effectively ceded influence in northern Syria to Assad and his allies and raised the specter of a resurgent ISIS. Over recent days, Kurdish authorities have reported the escape of hundreds of ISIS family members from a camp in northern Syria, and warned that ISIS militants held in prisons could be next to go if fighting with Turkish forces continues to escalate.  The situation began to deteriorate last week when the Trump administration ordered US troops to step aside from the border in northern Syria, effectively paving the way for Turkey to launch its offensive against the Kurds, who they regard as enemies.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who operate in the area are led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey considers a terrorist organization affiliated with the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the incursion into Syria is aimed at clearing a ""safe zone"" along the border to resettle some two million Syrian refugees currently hosted in Turkey.  But there are growing concerns over the safety of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Turkey's path, as Kurdish-controlled towns come under heavy fire, key border towns are seized and main roads are cut off.  Amid the chaos over the weekend, a grisly video began circulating on social media that appeared to show the execution-style killing of a prominent Kurdish politician, as well as her driver, members of Kurdish security forces and several civilians by Turkish-backed militants  The Free Syrian Army or FSA (also called the Syrian National Army), have denied those claims. CNN could not independently verify the video.  Assad's soldiers helping Kurdish forces  Units from the Syrian army reportedly arrived in northern towns Monday, after reaching an agreement with the Kurds to deploy troops along the entirety of Syria-Turkey border.  Syrian state media shared footage that it described as showing local residents welcoming the regime forces.  The new agreement between the Kurds and Damascus represents a new alliance in an area already saturated with infighting.  Key Kurdish factions, explained Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF): Coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters who are allied with the US in the war against ISIS. People's Protection Units (YPG): Kurdish militia which forms the backbone of the SDF and wants an independent Kurdish state in Syria. Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK): Kurdish separatist group linked to the YPG, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and US.  An autonomous administration set up by the Kurds, which covers a wide swathe of north and east Syria, said Sunday that it was the Syrian government's duty to protect its borders and sovereignty.  ""This agreement offers an opportunity to liberate the rest of the Syrian territories and cities occupied by the Turkish army as Afrin and other Syrian cities and towns,"" the statement said.  The group added on Monday that is was in the process of agreeing a ""memorandum of understanding"" on the protection of the border with the Russian side.  The deal means that Kurdish forces, who were considered vital US allies in the fight against ISIS, would be fighting alongside allies of President Bashar al-Assad's regime.  The Syrian government has not commented on such an agreement.  And, despite reports of the new partnership, Ankara said Monday it would move forward with its plans for the northeastern Syrian town of Manbij.  ""The plan is not for Turkey to go into Manbij, the plan is for the rightful owners of the area -- the Arabs, the tribes from that area who we are in touch with, to go in,"" Erdogan told reporters at Istanbul Airport.  ""Our approach is for them to go in and for us to provide security for them.""  ISIS families escape from camp  But Turkey's incursion has been condemned for undermining the stability and security of the whole region, raising fears that the chaos it has created could give rise to an ISIS 2.0.  Turkey and the Kurds have said they would work to ensure the safety of ISIS prisons during the offensive, but as the state of play on the ground continues to shift, so too do conflicting reports over how that threat is being handled.  On Monday, Turkey claimed that a jail holding ISIS fighters was emptied by the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), which controls the area now under attack. The allegation came a day after Kurdish authorities said that 785 people affiliated with foreign ISIS fighters escaped from Ain Issa, an encampment for displaced people, as a result of the fighting. Erdogan suggested the reports were ""disinformation,"" designed to ""provoke the US and Europe.""  CNN was unable to verify either of the claims.  Trump, who has warned he would ""obliterate"" Turkey's economy if it does not contain the ISIS threat, alleged that the SDF was intentionally releasing ISIS fighters.  ""Kurds may be releasing some to get us involved. Easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly. Big sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!"" Trump tweeted on Monday  But, US officials have told CNN there are no indications the SDF have intentionally released any of the 10,000-plus ISIS prisoners in their custody as part of a bid to draw international support.

Operation ""Peace Spring"" is the third major Turkish military operation inside the country since 2016. The scope and depth of the operation are still unknown, but it is likely to change the dynamics of the Syrian conflict in a major way.  Seizing the moment  Since 2012, Erdogan has been trying to establish a ""safe zone"" along the section of Turkey's border with Syria that falls to the east of the Euphrates River.  The Syrian opposition succeeded in pushing the forces of the Syrian regime out of the country's northeast in the summer of 2012, allowing the People's Protection Units, known by its Kurdish acronym YPG, to take control. Turkey says the YPG is the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which it classifies as a terrorist organisation.  Before 2016, Erdogan's plans to intervene militarily in Syria were opposed by both the Obama administration and the Turkish military, which the president did not yet have complete control over. Erdogan, as a result, declined to participate in the US-led war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), declared by Obama following the fall of Mosul, in the summer of 2014.  The United States was not, therefore, allowed to use the Incirlik airbase in the south of Turkey in the war against ISIL. It had, instead, to rely on bases further afield, such as al-Udiad in Qatar and Riffa in Bahrain. Meanwhile, the US shunned an offer by Turkey to arm and train Syrian opposition factions to confront ISIL and opted instead to use the YPG as a local proxy against ISIL.  To conceal the Kurdish identity of the US's chosen proxy in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes fighters from non-Kurdish groups, was established in 2015. The SDF was trained and armed by the US military.  When Turkey eventually decided to change course and allow the US to use its territories in the fight against ISIL in the summer of 2015, it was too late. By then, Russia had entered the fray on the side of the Syrian regime, changing the dynamics of Syria's conflict completely. This meant Turkey was now participating in a conflict entirely different from the one it was offered a role in a few years earlier. The change in circumstances was demonstrated clearly in November 2015, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near its border with Syria, unleashing a major crisis with Russia.  Securing the borders west of the Euphrates  Having received lip service by its NATO allies for its confrontation with Russia, Turkey found itself stuck between a strong rival - Russia - in the Syrian territories west of the Euphrates and an ally unsympathetic to its needs - the US - in the Syrian territories east of the Euphrates.  The failed military coup in Turkey in July 2016 provided Erdogan with an opportunity to mend fences with Russia and to get out of this strategic trap. Just one month after the attempted coup, during which Russia expressed support for Erdogan, Turkey was allowed to move into northwest Syrian and clear the area from both ISIL and the YPG. The operation, named ""Euphrates Shield"", paved the way for the establishment of the Astana process, wherein Russia and Turkey tried to reach a modus vivendi in Syria. Iran later also joined this arrangement.  In February 2018, Russia allowed Turkey to launch yet another operation, this time named ""Olive Branch"", to expel the YPG from Afrin. Having succeeded in securing the section of its border with Syria to the west of the Euphrates River, Turkey turned its attention to the east following this operation. With the defeat of ISIL in that region looming, Turkey started preparing to fill the vacuum that the planned departure of US forces would inevitably create there. To the dismay of Turkey, however, the US decided to stay.  Focusing on Trump  In January 2018, the State Department, under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, outlined a plan for a long-term US military presence in Syria. He defined four key objectives for the open-ended US military presence in northeast Syria. They included ensuring a lasting defeat of ISIL and al-Qaeda, creating the right conditions for the return of Syrian refugees, curbing Iranian influence in the region and holding UN-supervised elections aimed at securing a new leadership in Damascus. The latent motive behind this strategy, as Tillerson put it, was that the US ""cannot repeat the mistake of 2011, where a premature departure from Iraq allowed al-Qaeda to survive and eventually become ISIS"".  Trump was unconcerned. In March 2018, he fired Tillerson and the following month he took almost everyone off guard when he announced the full withdrawal of US troops from Syria. Under pressure from members of his own administration, as well as from regional and European allies, Trump gave the Pentagon and the State Department six months to finish the job against ISIL and pull troops out of Syria.  Turkey took advantage of this schism within the US administration and opened a direct channel with Trump. Hence, by the end of the six month period, Erdogan had called Trump and received assurances that the US would soon be leaving. Trump was quoted as telling Erdogan during their December 2018 phone call on Syria: ""It's all yours. We are done.""  The withdrawal plan, however, was shelved again and the US and Turkey entered into a lengthy negotiation on the issue that yielded no concrete results for almost a year.  On Sunday, October 6, another phone call between Erdogan and Trump changed the dynamics again. Trump decided that he would allow Turkey to go ahead with its military operation and establish a ""safe zone"". Three days later, the Turkish army entered Syria.  New dynamics  Although it is still unclear whether the US is planning to fully withdraw from Syria, or merely give way for Turkey to establish a ""safe zone"" near its border, the Turkish operation has already transformed the dynamics of the Syrian conflict, resulting in new alignments inside Syria and out.  The Arab Gulf states - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Kuwait - as well as Egypt and Israel have already voiced their opposition to Turkey's move. Speaking at an emergency Arab League meeting in Cairo on October 12, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit called Turkey's military operation in northeast Syria an ""invasion of an Arab state's land and an aggression on its sovereignty"". Saudi Arabia State Minister for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir also condemned the Turkish operation and demanded an immediate end to it.  Over the past year, Riyadh has exerted tremendous efforts to convince Trump to maintain a substantial military presence in northeast Syria to counterbalance both Turkey and Iran. Last November, the Saudis committed $100m to convince the US to remain in Syria. At one point, Riyadh even offered to send troops to patrol the area alongside the US and the YPG. Turkey's ""Peace Spring"" operation is, therefore, seen as a major blow to Saudi efforts to keep Ankara out of Syria.  Israel has also condemned the Turkish military operation and expressed sympathy with the YPG. ""Israel strongly condemns the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria and warns against the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds by Turkey and its proxies,"" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote. ""Israel is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the gallant Kurdish people.""  Israel has always been a champion of Kurdish separatism. The establishment of a greater Kurdistan is seen by Israel and some circles in Saudi Arabia as a means to weaken the major powers in the region, such as Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Surprisingly, Turkey's Astana partners, Russia and Iran, have shown more flexibility.  Moscow stated that it understands Turkish security concerns in northern Syria and joined forces with the US to block an EU-drafted statement at the UN Security Council calling upon Turkey to end its military operation.  Iran, too, expressed a similar position. This signals a major shift in the policies of the two countries towards the Turkish incursion. Earlier this year, both Moscow and Tehran had expressed opposition to Ankara's plans to establish a ""safe zone"" in northern Syria.  Now, however, Iran is not in a position to alienate Turkey while facing crippling US sanctions. Moscow also relies on Turkey's cooperation to end the conflict in Syria and secure its interests there. In addition, Russia's major concern at the moment is to expel the US from Syria, punish the Kurds for allying themselves with Washington and push them back into the lap of the Syrian regime.  This is exactly what has happened. Having been abandoned by their American patron, the Kurds now have nowhere to go but back to their old ally in Damascus. This is why they struck a deal with the Syrian regime and asked it to deploy its forces to the Turkish border. This constituted a major shift in the alliances shaping Syria's conflict.  This new arrangement will likely pit the Syrian regime forces against Turkey and the Turkish-backed Syrian opposition. Will Iran and Russia support the Syrian regime in this fight as they did in Idlib? At this stage, Moscow will likely try to work out an agreement between Turkey and the Syrian regime, revive the 1998 Adana Accord on border security between the two sides and establish a status quo acceptable to all.  Moscow made similar arrangements in the northwest in Afrin and in the areas affected by Turkey's ""Euphrates Shield"" operation. Moscow ultimately wants all foreign forces to permanently leave Syria, but it gives securing the departure of the US priority over everything else. Because once Washington gets out, Moscow will be able to decide the fate of Syria on its own, and manipulate the actions of all the other actors involved in the conflict, including Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel.

3459739,cnn,Analysis Arwa Damon Isil Sariyuce Cnn,Turkey's assault in Syria is a boon for Erdogan. Here's why,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/middleeast/erdogan-turkey-syria-incursion-intl/index.html,15/10/2019 0:00,16/10/2019 6:03,"Turkey-Syria border (CNN) A burst of orange flashed from a field on the Turkish-Syrian border, against the backdrop of the setting sun. Rattles of gunfire from Syria pierced the silence of a sleepy Turkish ghost town. This was less than a week into the Turkish offensive into northern Syria, ostensibly to clear a so-called safe zone, in what Ankara calls ""Operation Peace Spring.""  For some in this border area, however, these scenes over the weekend are not unfamiliar.  Turkey has been embroiled in a long-running conflict with Kurdish fighters on the Turkish side of the border, and the operation that Ankara launched across it last week is just the latest flare-up in decades of tensions.  Yet Turkey has ambitious goals for its current operation: to set up a safe zone and eventually resettle upwards of 2 million Syrian refugees living inside Turkey across the border, a move that observers say would dramatically change the Kurdish-Arab demographic balance in northeastern Syria.  This could serve as Turkey's solution to its Syrian refugee population, and ease growing resentment among Turks towards the Syrians who have sought safety in the country. But with recent developments on the ground, it's not clear if that will be part of the bargain.  It's also a rare moment of unification for Turkey. No matter how polarized the country's politics are, there is near unanimous support for military action against the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and its offshoots -- except, of course, from the pro-Kurdish party. This gives Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the chance to rally the country behind him after his party suffered biting blows in recent local elections in Ankara and Istanbul.  Four decades of conflict  Turkey's conflict with Kurdish separatist groups -- namely the PKK, which Turkey considers a terrorist organization -- has spanned four decades and claimed tens of thousands of lives. The PKK insurgency began in earnest in the mid 1980s. Its jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan operated from Syria, and fighters had camps in the country's north. By the late 1990s, Damascus had capitulated to mounting pressure from Ankara, evicting Ocalan and shutting down PKK camps.  In 1998, both countries signed what is known as the Adana agreement, which states that neither will harbor anyone nor permit any activity in their territory which jeopardizes the other.  The PKK is not just labeled a terrorist organization by Turkey, but also the US and the EU.  In 2013, Turkey came close to negotiating peace with the PKK, which would have been a momentous historic victory for Erdogan. But two-and-a-half years later, those talks disintegrated, a tenuous ceasefire was broken and the PKK launched an uprising in southeastern Turkey, for the first time controlling swaths of territory there. Pitched battles ensued before Turkey wrestled back control of the area, while simultaneously dealing with the fallout of PKK and ISIS attacks on towns and cities.  A person inspects the damage from a mortar fired from inside Syria, in Akcakale, southeastern Turkey, on Sunday.  With the rise of ISIS, the US-led coalition turned to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is dominated by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) as their fighting partners on the ground. The YPG is the armed branch of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), a sister organization or offshoot of the PKK.  As the US-backed YPG fought ISIS, Kurdish armed groups expanded their sphere of influence in northern Syria, and Turkey found most of its southern border controlled by what it considers to be an existential threat.  ""Turkey for the first time in history would be cut from the Arab world and this was a source of great paranoia for the Turkish government,"" said Behlul Ozkan, associate professor of international relations at Marmara University. ""All the mountainous regions are also controlled by the PKK. Add into this picture, there was a threat that ran all the way from Iran to the Mediterranean.""  This was a threat that Turkey had not calculated when it launched its high-risk Syria policy back in 2011, Ozkan adds.  Analysts say that Turkey believed that the Arab dictators whom protesters were trying to unseat across the region in the 2011 Arab Spring would not last. It was maneuvering to position itself as the leader of the revolutions across the Middle East and a potential post-revolution era with their collapse. Ankara even met with members of the Kurdish leadership in Syria to convince them to fight the regime, but they refused.  ""AKP (Erdogan's party) tried to convince PYD to fight against Assad,"" said Ozkan. ""There were high-level negotiations in Ankara, in around 2012,"" he said.  When the war on ISIS began, Turkey lost much more than it had bargained for.  ""The dramatic development was not just a PYD state, but one that was supported by Turkey's western allies."" Ozkan explains. ""The PYD also opened an office in Moscow. Suddenly the PYD was in action in Europe, Russia, and the US. Turkey's entire strategy was simultaneously falling apart.""  Russia pulls off coup while Washington in is 'disarray'  The geopolitical stage has now shifted again, and analysts liken what is going on to Turkey's 1974 Cyprus operation.  ""They launched a military intervention against Cyprus and (the attention of) Washington was sucked (in) by the fallout of Watergate"" said Serhat Guvenc, professor of international relations at Kadir Has University.  ""Today, Washington is in disarray. There is no policy. Erdogan and his staff view the current situation as a window of opportunity that should be seized upon.""  But seizing that opportunity has left Erdogan largely isolated, at least publicly. Some European countries announced they have halted arms sales to Ankara. The Arab world has condemned the move.  Facing criticism from Republican lawmakers and members of his own military, Trump on Monday sought to take a harder line on Turkey as the country pushed further into northern Syria. Trump said he was applying harsh new sanctions on certain Turkish officials, and in a phone call with Erdogan, Trump ""could not have been more firm"" in expressing his displeasure at the incursion, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters at the White House on Monday evening.  Mourners attend the funeral of five SDF fighters killed in battle against Turkey-led forces in the flashpoint town of Ras al-Ain on October 14.  Over the weekend, however, the Kurdish administration in northern Syria announced it had struck a deal with the Syrian regime, to have Bashar al-Assad's forces deploy along the border.  And just like that, Russia pulled off a geopolitical coup without firing a single shot.  ""For the Russians, the idea is that the Turks will help them get rid of the Americans without any cost. Turkey is pulling the chestnut out of the fire for Russia and the Syrian regime."" Guvenc said. ""Russia has pulled off a very fine game of diplomacy because the Kurds finally accepted to deal with the Syrian regime to abandon those areas to the regime control.""  ""We will see I think in the coming days to what extent Putin is willing to let Turkey move in Syria,"" he added. ""The only challenge for Putin is to persuade Erdogan to pull out Turkish troops from Syria and return those parts of Syria controlled by Turkish military, but that will be part of future negotiations.""  Russia's ultimate goal is being reached: getting the Americans out of Syria. The Syrian regime is also making large strides forward by regaining areas that were under Kurdish control, breaking a years-long political deadlock in the region.  For Turkey, this is a bitter pill -- but one that it can likely swallow. Toppling Assad was one of Turkey's main priorities during Syria's eight-year war, but if the regime takes over the towns along the Turkish-Syrian border, Turkey's security will be ensured, at the expense of potentially accepting that the Damascus regime will remain in power.  It is hardly the first time in history that the Kurds have been betrayed by Western powers. After World War I, the Kurds were promised their own state only to have their population -- which extends through Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran -- divided by new international borders.  At its core, this is all political horse trading with bloody consequences. The situation in Syria is extraordinarily complex and far from resolved. Syria today is a country where the US has no influence, Turkey has made its move, and where Russia is at the top of the game. And when it comes to this type of geopolitical multidimensional chess, it's the civilian population that has neither a say nor a voice, but is at the mercy of the players.",en,terrorattack,839,['Syria']

Speaking to journalists traveling on his presidential plane following a visit to Azerbaijan Tuesday, Erdogan said a ceasefire was off the table. ""Declare a ceasefire, they say. We will never declare a ceasefire,"" Erdogan said. ""We do not sit at the table with terrorist organizations.""  Erdogan's comments come as Russian-backed Syrian regime troops on Tuesday gained control of the town of Manbij and surrounding areas, until recently an active US military outpost  Russia has stepped up its role in the Syrian conflict by deploying military police to the country's north -- filling a vacuum left by the withdrawal of US troops from the area.  Russian units are patrolling a contact line between Syrian and Turkish forces, according to a statement by Russia's Defense Ministry. On Tuesday, Russia's presidential envoy on Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, told state news agency TASS that Moscow ""won't allow"" clashes between Turkish and Syrian forces on the ground.  After Turkey launched a long-threatened offensive across the border into Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria last week, local Syrian Kurdish leaders struck a deal with Syria's government in Damascus to enforce the border.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who operate in the area are led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey considers a terrorist organization affiliated with the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The SDF, however, are US allies that were considered instrumental in the fight against ISIS in northern Syria.  Turkey's offensive, called the Peace Spring Operation, is aimed at clearing Kurdish forces away from its border area and resettling 2 million Syrian refugees currently hosted in Turkey into a 30 kilometer (18.6 mile) ""safe zone"" along the border.  On Tuesday, the Trump administration said it was dispatching Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O'Brien as part of a delegation departing to Ankara Wednesday, to broker a deal to stop the Turkish military operation in Syria.  The delegation's planned departure comes after President Donald Trump announced sanctions against Turkey and threatened to ""destroy"" the country's economy if it does not halt its incursion.  On Monday, Trump tweeted a statement saying he would soon authorize via executive order new sanctions on current and former Turkish officials. He said he'd also reimpose heavy duties on Turkish steel and cut off trade talks.  It marks an attempt by the White House to adopt a firmer stance after facing harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers and senior national security veterans for withdrawing US troops from northern Syria, paving the way for Turkey's military offensive.  But Erdogan told reporters onboard the presidential plane Tuesday that his government is ""not worried"" about any US sanctions.  ""They are pressuring us to stop the operation (in northern Syria). They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions,"" he said.  Erdogan not concerned about Syrian forces  According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Syrian government forces have taken control of two areas in northern Syria on Tuesday -- more than 1,000 square kilometers around the town of Manbij and an area in Raqqa around the town of Tabqa.  Erdogan said Tuesday that Syrian regime forces entering Manbij was ""not very negative for me"" so long as Kurdish ""terrorists"" are cleared from the region.  ""It's their lands after all. But what is important to me is that the terrorist organization does not remain there,"" he said.  The Turkish president said he told Putin, a key ally of the Syrian government, that ""if you are clearing Manbij of terrorist organizations, then go ahead, you or the regime can provide all the logistics. But if you are not going to do this, the people there are telling us to save them.""  Erdogan also told reporters that the latest delivery of a Russian-made S-400 missile defense system -- which Washington opposes Ankara buying -- will arrive in November or December.  The first delivery of components arrived in July and Erdogan's comments are likely to further rile up US officials, who have threatened to level sanctions against Turkey if the system ever became operational.  The State Department had repeatedly warned that ""Turkey will face very real and very negative consequences if it completes the delivery of the S-400,"" as spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said at the end of May.

Addressing reporters, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, reiterated Washington's demand for a halt to Ankara's offensive - which Vice President Mike Pence will press when he travels to Turkey later on Wednesday.

Thousands of IS prisoners are held in Kurdish-run camps in the region. Two Belgian militants have already escaped from detention there since Turkey launched its offensive, the head of the Belgian national anti-terrorist agency said.

US President Donald Trump denied giving Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a ""green light"" for the incursion.  Almost a week of deadly bombardment and fighting there has killed dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and prompted at least 160,000 to flee their homes.

""Anyway, big progress being made!!!!"" he exclaimed on Twitter. A day earlier, he had proclaimed that a U.S.-brokered cease-fire deal with Turkey marked ""a great day for civilization,"" though the deal's effect was largely to mitigate a foreign policy crisis widely seen to be of his own making.  In a series of tweets, Trump said he had spoken Friday to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid reports that fighting actually had not ended.  ""He told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated,"" Trump tweeted, adding that there is ""good will on both sides."" He said, ""The U.S. has secured the Oil & the ISIS Fighters are double secured by Kurds & Turkey.""  Officials have said a number of ISIS fighters, likely fewer than 100, have escaped custody since Turkey launched its invasion last week.  Trump said nothing further about the European nations he contended had agreed to take some of the IS fighters.  After hours of negotiation in Ankara, the two nations Thursday agreed to a five-day cease-fire in the Turks' deadly attacks on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, but some fighting continued early Friday in a northeast Syrian border town. The Kurds were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State group but came under assault after Trump ordered U.S. troops to leave the area earlier this month.  The agreement requires the Kurds to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border in an arrangement that largely solidifies Turkey's position and aims in the weeklong conflict.  Vice President Mike Pence, who reached the deal with Erdogan, hailed the agreement as the way to end the bloodshed caused by Turkey's invasion.  But he remained silent on whether it amounted to a second abandonment of America's former Kurdish allies, many of whom are branded as terrorists by Ankara. The deal includes a conditional halt to American economic sanctions and no apparent long-term consequences for Turkey for its actions.  Turkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria a week ago, two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the U.S. military from the area.  Trump was widely criticized for turning on the Kurds, who had taken heavy casualties as partners with the U.S. in fighting IS extremists since 2016.  While U.S. officials have insisted that Trump did not authorize Turkey's invasion, the cease-fire codifies nearly all of Turkey's stated goals in the conflict.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the United States had accepted the idea of a ""safe zone"" long pushed by Turkey, and he insisted Turkish armed forces will control the zone. He also made clear that Turkey will not stop at a previously limited zone; he said Turkish control of the Syrian side of the border must extend all the way to the Iraqi border.  Caught in the middle, the commander of Kurdish-led forces in Syria, Mazloum Abdi, told Kurdish TV, ""We will do whatever we can for the success of the cease-fire agreement."" But one Kurdish official, Razan Hiddo, declared that Kurdish people would refuse to live under Turkish occupation.  Trump seemed to endorse the Turkish aim of ridding the Syrian side of the border of the Kurdish fighters. ""They had to have it cleaned out,"" he said.  During a campaign rally in Texas on Thursday night, Trump said, ""Sometimes you have to let them fight, like two kids in a lot, you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.""  In the negotiations, a senior U.S. official said, Pence and national security adviser Robert O'Brien expressed condolences to Erdogan and his military commanders over their dead and injured in the weeklong campaign.  Leading U.S. lawmakers were less pleased than Trump.  Sen. Mitt Romney, the Republicans' presidential nominee in 2012, said he welcomed the cease-fire but it ""does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally.""  A senior U.S. official insisted that the agreement was negotiated in consultation with Kurdish forces, and Pence said the U.S. would ""facilitate"" the Kurds' pullout, but he did not say if that would include the use of American troops.  The Pentagon had no immediate comment.  As Pence was speaking in Ankara, U.S. troops were continuing to board aircraft leaving northern Syria. Officials said a couple of hundred had already departed, with hundreds more consolidated at a few bases waiting to move out.  While the cease-fire seemed likely to temporarily slow legislation in Congress aimed at punishing Turkey and condemning Trump's U.S. troop withdrawal, lawmakers gave no sign of completely dropping the measures.  Shortly before the announcement of the pause in hostilities, Graham and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., introduced legislation that would bar U.S. military aid to Turkey, seek to curb foreign arms sales to Ankara and impose sanctions on top Turkish officials unless Turkey withdraws its forces. Those sanctions would include a report on Erdogan's family assets.  In contrast with Pence's description of a limited safe zone, the agreement would effectively create a zone of control patrolled by the Turkish military that Ankara wants to stretch for the entire border from the Euphrates River to the Iraqi border, though the agreement did not define the extent of the zone. Turkish forces currently control about a quarter of that length, captured in the past nine days.  The rest is held by the Kurdish-led forces or by the Syrian government military, backed by Russia, which the Kurds invited to move in to shield them from the Turks. None of those parties has much reason to let Turkish forces into the areas.  Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, tweeted, ""This is a respite while we surrender to Turkish domination of Northeast Syria.""  ___  AP writers Robert Burns, Deb Riechmann, Alan Fram, Darlene Superville, Lolita C.

It follows repeated claims that there were several children injured in a chemical weapons attack on the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, thought to have involved white phosphorous.  It is a claim vociferously denied by Turkey.  Image: People have been injured in the border town of Ras al Ain  The president invited a relatively small number of foreign reporters to his Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul - the day after he brokered an agreement with the Americans to end the fighting.  During the gathering, which ran for more than an hour and a half, the Turkish leader insisted his forces do not have chemical weapons. ""I am very confident in no way do we have chemical weapons. It is not in the Turkish military,"" Mr Erdogan said.  Advertisement  The president referred journalists to a booklet his officials have produced called Myths and Facts - Disinformation Campaigns Against Operation Peace Spring.  In it, the Turkish officials say their enemies have resorted to ""perception operations"" for the purpose of ""deceiving the national and world public opinion"".  They produced an array of photographs which they said were fake but used to turn public opinion against the Turkish operation.  There were several of people who were victims of chemical weapons but had been taken some time ago, in some cases in entirely different countries.  :: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker  They included one photograph which appeared to show a severely burned man being treated after suffering injuries from a phosphorous bomb.  The picture was actually taken after one of the Israeli attacks against Gaza in January 2009.  The anti-propaganda campaign comes as the United Nations announced it was examining whether war crimes had been committed during the military operation.  Mr Erdogan told the group of foreign reporters the temporary halt in fighting ""was going well"" and there were ""no problems"".  Turkey agrees 'ceasefire' in Syria offensive  But by the end of the first day, the Kurdish-led SDF issued a statement calling for international observers, claiming the US/Turkey agreement had not stopped fighting.  It said: ""Ankara, its occupation army and thousands of its mercenaries disregarded this agreement, did not abide by it and continued their aggression as if such agreement did not happen at all.""  The president appeared to be enjoying his interaction with the foreign media, teasing one reporter: ""Your Turkish is as good as my English"" and ordering corn and baked chestnut nibbles for his guests.  But he responded angrily to one question when the correspondent referred to communication between the US president and the SDF Commander Mazloum Kobane.  ""You are talking about a terrorist organisation,"" he said. ""We are not at war (in northern Syria), because you can only go to war with another state. We are fighting terrorism and terrorists.""  'It was unconventional, what I did'  Mr Erdogan is clearly frustrated with what he perceives to be the lack of support from fellow NATO members, saying: ""Turkey is a NATO member. When did the YPG become a NATO member?""  He went on to ""strongly condemn"" the approach of some countries and their stand towards the YPG.  The president said: ""If you want to fight terror, you need to stand tall. The weapons have to be collected but some of the terrorists' weapons come from fellow NATO members like Germany, Britain and France.  ""This is not acceptable.""  He outlined several times how he expected other countries to share the financial burden of looking after the millions of refugees displaced by the fighting in Syria.  Image: Turkey have disproved some of the images circulating about the attacks  Another document handed out to the group was a portfolio of artist images of how the ""buffer zone"" will look in the future with a dazzling array of facilities including mosques, police stations, government buildings and apartments.  ""But Turkey cannot bear the burden on its own,"" he said.  He wants a donor conference so countries can pledge money to help fund this vision for the buffer zone - and he expects America to be the frontrunner with donations.  I'm told the president has only held two of these gatherings for foreign media in seven years. He's fighting on two fronts - and one of them is the propaganda war.  He knows right now he may have succeeded in his first objective which was to get America to persuade the Kurdish forces to withdraw... now he is working on his second.",en,terrorattack,,

(AP photo)  KABUL, Afghanistan: An explosion rocked a mosque in eastern Afghanistan as dozens of people gathered for Friday prayers, causing the roof to collapse and killing 62 worshippers, provincial officials said. The attack underscored the record-high number of civilians dying in the country's 18-year war.  Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar Province, said the militant attack wounded 36 others. He said it was not immediately clear if the mosque was attacked by a suicide bomber or by some other type of bombing.  ""Both men and children are among those killed and wounded in the attack,'' he said.  Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, strongly condemned the attack on his official Twitter account. ""The Afghan government strongly condemns today's suicide attack in a mosque in Nangarhar province,'' he tweeted.  ""The Taliban and their partners heinous crimes continue to target civilians in time of worship,'' he added.  No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but both the Taliban and the Islamic State group are active in eastern Afghanistan, especially Nangarhar province.  However, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's spokesman in a statement condemned the attack in Nangarhar and called it a serious crime.  Zahir Adil, spokesman for the public health department in Nangarhar Province, said 23 of the wounded were transferred to Jalalabad, the provincial capital, and the rest were being treated in the Haskamena district clinic.  The spokesman for UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said Mr Guterres ""strongly'' condemned the attack and said those responsible must be held accountable.  Amnesty International's deputy South Asia director, Omar Waraich, said the attack ""demands the world's attention''.  ""Flagrant violations of international humanitarian law such as deliberate targeting of civilians are not something anyone should get used to or learn to ignore,'' he said.  The violence comes a day after a United Nations report said that Afghan civilians are dying in record numbers in the country's increasingly brutal war, noting that more civilians died in July than in any previous one-month period since the UN began keeping statistics.  ""Civilian casualties at record-high levels clearly show the need for all parties concerned to pay much more attention to protecting the civilian population, including through a review of conduct during combat operations,'' said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Afghanistan.  The report said that pro-government forces caused 2,348 civilian casualties, including 1,149 killed and 1,199 wounded, a 26% increase from the same period in 2018.  The report said 2,563 civilians were killed and 5,676 were wounded in the first nine months of this year. Insurgents were responsible for 62%. July to September were the deadliest months so far this year.  Efforts to restart talks to end Afghanistan's 18-year war picked up earlier this month, just weeks after President Donald Trump last month declared the talks ""dead'', blaming a surge in violence by the Taliban that included the killing of a US soldier.  US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad visited Pakistan and met with the Taliban's top negotiator, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Baradar is a co-founder of the hard-line Islamic movement and was head of a Taliban delegation to the Pakistani capital.  US officials said Khalilzad was only in the Pakistani capital to follow up on talks he held in September in New York with Pakistani officials, including Prime Minister Imran Khan. They insisted he was not in Pakistan to restart US-Taliban peace talks.  In western Herat province, six civilians including four children were killed Thursday when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb, said Jelani Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor. He added that five other civilians were wounded in the attack in the Zawal district.",en,terrorattack,849,['Afghanistan']

The multi-pronged attack on the checkpoint in the Ali Abad district of northern Kunduz province began late on Monday and set off an hours-long shootout, according to Ghulam Rabani Rabani, a provincial council member.  More:  Along with the 15 policemen killed, two other officers were wounded in the assault, he said.  The attack came as Afghan troops have been battling the Taliban for the past few weeks in Kunduz's Dashti Archi and Imam Sahib districts, Rabani added.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the checkpoint attack.  Strong presence  The Taliban has a strong presence in Kunduz and controls several of the province's districts.  The provincial capital, the city of Kunduz, briefly fell to the Taliban in 2015 before the armed group withdrew in the face of a NATO-backed Afghan offensive.  The city is a strategic crossroads with easy access to much of northern Afghanistan as well as the country's capital, Kabul, about 335km (200 miles) away.  The Taliban pushed back into the city centre again a year later, briefly raising its flag before gradually being driven out again.  The armed group launched another attempt to overrun the city in August but was repelled.  The Taliban now controls nearly half of Afghanistan and has been relentless in its near-daily attacks targeting Afghan security forces, attacks that often inflict heavy casualties.  The fighting has also killed scores of civilians.  'Endless war'  US President Donald Trump, since his 2016 presidential campaign, has spoken of a need to withdraw US troops from the ""endless war"" in Afghanistan.  He has complained the US has served as policemen in Afghanistan and it is not the US military's job.  Washington has about 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan as part of the US-led coalition. US forces are training and advising Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism operations against armed fighters.  Trump had ordered a troop withdrawal in conjunction with the peace talks that would have left about 8,600 US forces in the country.  Last month, US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad brokered a preliminary peace deal with the Taliban.  But a surge in Taliban violence and the death of a US soldier prompted Trump to cancel a secret Camp David meeting where the peace deal would have been finalised and declare the tentative agreement ""dead"".",en,terrorattack,,

The two leaders met in southern Russia with just hours to go before a deadline for the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from parts of Syria under a US-brokered deal.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Putin - who has emerged as the key powerbroker in Syria - said he hoped to find a way to deal with the ""very severe"" situation in the country's north.  Sitting down with Erdogan in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin said he believed that good ties between the two countries ""will let us find an answer to even the most difficult questions"".  Russia and Turkey have emerged as the main foreign players in Syria's conflict, with Moscow's position strengthened after US President Donald Trump announced this month he would be withdrawing American forces from the north of the country.  The announcement cleared the way for Turkey to launch a cross-border offensive on October 9 against the Kurdish YPG militia, viewed by Ankara as ""terrorists"" linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Advertisement  Advertisement  The assault sparked Western outrage and accusations of betrayal from the Kurds, whose frontline fighters were crucial in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria.  Speaking to reporters at Ankara airport on his way to Sochi, Erdogan said he and Putin would discuss ""steps to end (Kurdish fighters') presence in regime-held areas"" of Syria.  Following a deal with US Vice President Mike Pence last week, Turkey announced a 120-hour pause of the offensive from last Thursday under which Kurdish fighters were to withdraw.  Turkey says that deadline expires at 1900 GMT on Tuesday and Erdogan warned Ankara would not hesitate to resume its military assault.  ""If the promises given to our country by the United States are not kept, we will continue our operation from where we left off with greater determination,"" he said.  RUSSIA MOVES IN  Russia is a crucial ally of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and has demanded that Turkey respect the country's territorial integrity.  As the US troops began to withdraw last week, Russian forces moved in to support the Syrian army, whose help against Turkey was requested by the Kurds.  Erdogan said last week he was not bothered by the Damascus regime's return as what mattered to Ankara was pushing back the Kurdish fighters from the proposed 32-kilometre-deep (20-mile) safe zone.  Despite being on the opposite sides of the Syria conflict, Turkey and Russia have been working together to find a solution to the war.  Erdogan said he would also discuss the situation in Syria's northwestern region of Idlib during the meeting with Putin.  Assad said Tuesday that defeating jihadists in Idlib is the key to ending the country's eight-year-old civil conflict.  ""The battle of Idlib is the basis for resolving chaos and terrorism in all other areas of Syria,"" he said while visiting troops on the front line with jihadists in the town of Al-Hbeit in Idlib province.  'TALKING WITH TERRORISTS'  Erdogan confirmed the withdrawal of some Kurdish fighters from the zone he wants to run from Jarabulus in northwestern Syria up to the Iraqi border.  ""Around 700-800 have withdrawn so far,"" Erdogan said, adding that the remaining 1,200-1,300 would reportedly also be pulling out.  ""We are pursuing it. The process will not be over without a full withdrawal,"" he warned.  On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron told Putin that France wanted to see an extension of the ceasefire by Turkey. But Erdogan rejected this on Tuesday.  ""There is no such proposal that was conveyed to me from Macron. Macron is in fact talking about such things mostly with terrorists,"" Erdogan said, referring to a meeting between Jihane Ahmed, the spokeswoman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and the French leader.  Ankara says the YPG is a ""terrorist"" offshoot of the PKK, which has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey since 1984.

Usman Khan, wearing a fake suicide vest and wielding knives, went on the rampage at a conference on criminal rehabilitation beside London Bridge on Friday, killing two people.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The 28-year old Briton, who was wrestled to the ground by bystanders and then shot dead by police, was convicted in 2012 for his part in an al Qaeda-inspired plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange. He was released in December 2018 subject to conditions.  Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, criticised the government's sentencing policies.  ""There's got to be a very full investigation,"" said Corbyn who is seeking to depose Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the election on Dec 12 but trails in opinion polls.  ""I think there is also a question about what the probation service were doing ... and whether the parole board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released from prison in the first place,"" he said.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Earlier, Johnson said the London Bridge attack was a terrorist act and vowed to end a practice whereby serious offenders can be automatically let out of prison early.  ""I have long said that this system simply isn't working,"" he said after visiting the scene of the attack on Saturday.  Islamic State said the attack on Friday was carried out by one of its fighters and was in response to its calls to target countries that had been part of a coalition fighting the jihadist group, according to its Amaq news agency. The group did not provide any evidence for its assertion.  A man and a women were killed in the attack, with local media naming one of the victims as Jack Merritt, a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme which held the conference at Fishmongers' Hall.  Three people remain in hospital with two victims in a stable condition while a third person is suffering from less serious injuries, according to the National Health Service.  ECHOES OF 2017  Police said they were continuing their investigation by searching an address in Stafford and the Stoke areas of central England, with the country's top counter-terrorism officer saying they were not looking for any other suspects.  ""We have found no evidence to suggest anybody else was involved in this attack,"" said Neil Basu.  London Bridge was the scene of an attack during the 2017 election when three militants drove a van into pedestrians and then attacked people in the surrounding area, killing eight people and injuring at least 48.  Islamic State said its fighters were responsible for that attack, but the British authorities have cast doubt on those claims. The 2017 attack focused attention on cuts to policing since the ruling Conservatives took power in 2010.  Friday's attack prompted a pause in election campaigning, but scaled-back activities resumed on Saturday, ahead of the election that could decide the fate of Brexit.  Law and order is now likely to feature more prominently in the campaign in the coming days.  The Conservatives could fail to win an overall majority during next month's election according to a BMG poll published on Saturday, conducted before the attack. It showed their lead over Labour had fallen to six points from 13 a week ago.  On Saturday, Queen Elizabeth sent her sympathies to those affected by the attack and praised those who intervened to thwart the assailant.

Police shot Usman Khan dead after his suspected assault that seriously injured three other people was broken up by bystanders - one armed with a five-foot narwhal tusk and another a fire extinguisher.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Video footage of the confrontation showed Khan, 28, being challenged by a man wielding the tusk - believed to have been taken from a nearby historic hall - and sprayed with the extinguisher.  He had been conditionally released from jail last December after serving less than half of a 16-year sentence for terrorism, and was wearing a suspected fake explosive device.  Moments later armed police officers arrived on the scene and shot him dead.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Investigators have said they are not actively seeking others in relation to the incident, which recalled a three-man terrorist assault two years ago on London Bridge that killed eight.  The latest attack came less than two weeks before Britain's general election, and politicians temporarily suspended campaigning.  Security Minister Brandon Lewis said the government would check whether sentences were being dealt with ""in a proper way"" following Friday's carnage.  ""After any incident like this, there has to be and always is, a full review and lessons-learned exercise taken forward,"" he told BBC Radio.  ""We have to let the investigation complete itself first, but that will absolutely happen.""  ""BUNDLE HIM TO THE GROUND""  Khan, from Stoke in central England, was handed an indeterminate sentence for public protection in 2012, with at least eight years in prison, along with eight others inspired by Al-Qaeda who had plotted to bomb targets including the London Stock Exchange.  They were also found guilty of making longer-term plans including taking part in ""terrorist training"" in Pakistan.  But the sentences of Khan and two co-conspirators were quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2013 and he received a new 21-year sentence, comprising a maximum custodial term of 16 years.  Police on Saturday were reportedly searching a property in Stafford, in central England, thought to be connected to Khan.  Police believe he began the attack at Fishmonger's Hall, a historic building said to contain many ancient artefacts on the north side of the bridge.  It was hosting an event organised by the University of Cambridge's criminology institute on prisoner rehabilitation, attended by Khan, who reportedly arrived with two knives and the fake suicide vest.  Vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope said he was ""devastated"" that the university's staff, students and alumni may have been targeted.  The Metropolitan Police appealed for witnesses from the event to come forward.  As the attack moved to London Bridge, a throng of people could be seen in videos grappling with Khan on a pedestrian walkway.  Tour guide Stevie Hurst told BBC radio that ""everyone was just on top of him trying to bundle him to the ground.  ""I saw that the knife was still in his hand so I just put a foot in to try and kick him in the head: we were trying to do as much as we could to try and dislodge the knife,"" he said.  One man in a suit and tie - identified by media as a police officer - was later seen carrying a large knife away.  ""MISTAKE""  Attention has swiftly turned to how Khan could have been released from prison after serving less than seven years of his sentence.  Inmates are usually released half-way through the type of determinate sentence he was given, and time spent in custody before trial may have been taken into account.  The Parole Board said it had no involvement in his release and that it appeared to have happened automatically as required by law.  During the attack, Khan wore an electronic tag used to monitor criminal offenders, The Times newspaper reported.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who chaired a meeting of the government's emergencies committee late Friday, said he had ""long argued"" it was a ""mistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early"".  Johnson, who hopes to win a majority in a Dec 12 election and take Britain of the European Union, praised the emergency services and the public for their response.  On Nov 4, Britain downgraded its terrorism threat level from ""severe"", the second-highest of five levels, to ""substantial"" - the lowest rating in more than five years.  The 2017 London Bridge attack involved Islamist extremists in a van who ploughed into pedestrians before attacking people at random with knives in nearby Borough Market.  Eight people were killed and 48 wounded. The three attackers, who were wearing fake suicide devices, were shot dead by police.",en,terrorattack,852,"['UK', 'London']"

The attack happened following the surrender of a bandit to the authorities.  Lieutenant Colonel Gerald Monfort, spokesperson of the Joint Task Force Sulu, said the bandits attacked police personnel who were on patrol in Barangay Buhanginan aboard a vehicle around 6.50pm, and a brief gunfight lasting about five minutes ensued.  Members of the 6th Special Forces Battalion, who reinforced the engaged policemen, immediately rushed the four to Camp General Bautista Hospital in SuluÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capital Jolo.  Major General Corleto Vinluan Jr, commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said the attack could be a retaliation for the series of setbacks suffered by the bandits in the continuing crackdown on their ranks.  Vinluan claimed that more civilians are now involved in the campaign against the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu. - The Philippine Daily Inquirer/Asia News Network",en,terrorattack,,

The shooting, which took place in a classroom building at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, left eight people wounded, including two sheriff's deputies who responded to the attack.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the shooter was from Saudi Arabia -- the same nationality as 15 of the 19 men involved in the 9/11 attacks, some of whom attended civilian flight school in Florida.  ""There's obviously going to be a lot of questions about this individual being a foreign national, being a part of the Saudi air force and then to be here training on our soil,"" DeSantis told a press conference.  ""Obviously the government of Saudi Arabia needs to make things better for these victims. And I think they are going to owe a debt here given that this is one of their individuals.""  Captain Timothy Kinsella said the shooter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whose name authorities declined to release Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was an aviation trainee, one of ""a couple hundred"" foreign students at the base.  Saudi Arabia's King Salman telephoned Trump on Friday to denounce the shooting, the official Saudi Press Agency said.  ""He (the king) affirmed that the perpetrator of this heinous crime does not represent the Saudi people,"" the report said.  Trump said in a tweet that King Salman ""just called to express his sincere condolences and give his sympathies to the families and friends of the warriors who were killed and wounded in the attack that took place in Pensacola, Florida.""  Police received their first call about the shooting shortly before 7:00 am (1200 GMT), Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said.  One of the responding deputies eventually killed the attacker, who used a handgun.  Only members of the security forces can bring weapons on base, Kinsella said, and it was not clear how the shooter got the gun onto the premises.  ""Walking through the crime scene was like being on the set of a movie,"" Morgan said. ""You don't expect this to happen.""  Kinsella said the base's security forces first responded before outside police agencies arrived.  The facility, made up mostly of classrooms, was shut down until further notice.  Witnesses described a chaotic scene as police rushed to respond.  Federal agencies are investigating, authorities said, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  Military base shootings rare  Just two days earlier, a US sailor fatally shot two people and wounded a third at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Hawaii before taking his own life.  The Pensacola naval air station hosts 16,000 military personnel and more than 7,000 civilians, and is home to a flight demonstration squadron.  It is an early training center for naval pilots, and is known as the ""cradle of naval aviation.""  The base is the center for the US Navy foreign military training programs, established in 1985 specifically for Saudi students before being expanded to other nationalities.  Saudi Arabia has long been a major US ally in the Middle East, thanks primarily to security considerations and oil.  While mass shootings in the United States are common, those at military facilities are rare.  In July 2015, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez carried out an attack at two military installations in Tennessee that killed four Marines and a sailor, with the FBI concluding that the violence was inspired by a ""foreign terrorist group.""  Two years earlier, Aaron Alexis killed 12 people and wounded eight others at the Washington Navy Yard, just two miles (three kilometers) from the US Capitol building, before being shot dead by officers.  Four years before that, Major Nidal Hasan, a US Army psychiatrist, killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at Fort Hood.  He was considered a ""lone wolf"" who supported terror network Al-Qaeda.  Supporters of tighter gun laws seized on the latest shooting.  ""Our veterans and active-duty military put their lives on the line to protect us overseas -- they shouldn't have to be terrorized by gun violence at home,"" Cindy Martin, a volunteer with the Florida chapter of Moms Demand Action whose daughter works at the naval base, said in a statement.

In Jersey City, crowds of men in black hats surrounded the casket of Mindy Ferencz in the Jersey City neighborhood of Greenville at the site of a synagogue under construction. Hundreds of women, separated from the men as per Orthodox Jewish tradition, were standing in the bitter cold sobbing.  Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered outside the Satmar Shul orthodox synagogue in Brooklyn to mourn 24-year-old Moshe Deutsch.  Orthodox Jewish men carry the casket of one of the victims of Tuesday's shootings in Jersey City.  As the funeral for Ferencz and Deutsch took place, investigators were still trying to determine what motivated the pair of shooters, who were also killed, to carry out Tuesday's attack.  One of the assailants of the deadly attack in Jersey City market has been linked to the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, The New York Times reported Wednesday.  The shooter, David N. Anderson, appears to have a connection to the movement but the extent of his involvement in that group is unclear, a law enforcement official told the newspaper.  The Black Hebrew Israelite movement is best known for its confrontational brand of street preaching in urban areas but it has a complex history in the United States, with sects and branches splintering over theological and leadership disputes. Scholars say what unites most Black Israelites is the belief that African Americans are the true descendants of biblical Jews.  Some members have expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in the past.  David N. Anderson  Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, went on a shooting spree and had an hours-long gunbattle with police Tuesday that left four people dead -- three people in the market and a police officer, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said.  Earlier Wednesday, authorities did not discuss the pair's background and said only they are the ""prime suspects"" in the killing of an Uber driver in Bayonne, New Jersey, Grewal said.  Francine Graham  Authorities were checking into a note found in a stolen U-Haul truck used by the shooters Tuesday that contained both anti-Semitic and anti-police writing, a law enforcement source told CNN.  Posts with similar sentiments also have been found on social media linked to the shooters, the source said.  Law enforcement officers found a operable pipe bomb in the back of the U-Haul, Newark FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie said.  ""It's down at the FBI laboratory right now. It was a viable device, meaning it could be a device that would have exploded,"" Ehrie told reporters Wednesday.  How the attack unfolded  The Tuesday afternoon store attack led to chaotic scenes over several hours in the city across the Hudson River from Manhattan, with heavily armed officers taking over city streets, pulling up in armored personnel vehicles amid the sounds of sirens and gunshots.  Authorities believe the shooters first killed Jersey City police Det. Joseph Seals at a cemetery, and then drove to the Jersey City Kosher Supermarket, kicking off the gun attack and police shootout, Grewal said.  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Around 12:21 p.m., Anderson parked a U-Haul truck directly across the street from the supermarket, about a mile from the cemetery. He exited with a rifle and began shooting at the market while Graham followed him inside.  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Around 12:38 p.m., a bystander called 911 to report Seals' body in the cemetery.  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Around 12:43 p.m., police arrived near the supermarket ""and engaged with the two suspects inside,"" starting a long shootout.  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Around 3:25 p.m., a police armored vehicle broke into the supermarket's entryway.  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Around 3:47 p.m., law enforcement found Anderson and Graham's bodies inside the supermarket.  Earlier Wednesday, Jersey City Department of Public Safety Director James Shea told reporters that authorities learned the incident began as an attack on civilians in the store and progressed into a gunbattle with officers after reviewing surveillance video.  Authorities had been unclear in the immediate aftermath of the attack about how the shootings and the gunfire exchange unfolded.  A survivor escaped after being shot  A person who was inside the market was shot when Anderson and Graham opened fire but was able to flee early on.  ""The survivor was able to escape the store at the beginning of the incident and we are not providing his name at this time,"" Grewal said Wednesday.  Ferencz, 31 and Deutsch were among the three people who were killed in Tuesday's attack.  Ferencz, the wife of the store owner, was killed almost immediately after the two suspects entered. Deutsch, a customer at the store, and a store worker -- Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49 -- were also killed in the shooting, Grewal said.  Deutsch and Ferencz both had ties to the Jewish community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said.  Some officials say the attack was a hate crime  While New Jersey investigators say they don't yet know why the shooters attacked the store, some officials there and in neighboring New York City have said they think the attack was a hate crime.  ""My sentiment is that it should be viewed as a hate crime,"" Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop told reporters Wednesday afternoon. ""There's no question it was an attack on the Jewish community.""  De Blasio said he agreed with Fulop.  ""What we saw yesterday was a premeditated, violent anti-Semitic hate crime,"" de Blasio told reporters in his city Wednesday.  ""In other words, you can say it was an act of terror because it was premeditated, it was violent, and it was directed at the Jewish community,"" the mayor said.  Police responded to reports of shots fired Tuesday in Jersey City.  Officials in both states say they're reaching out to the Jewish community. Fulop said officials would be meeting Wednesday with community leaders.  In New York City, hundreds of police officers will monitor dozens of Jewish locations ""for a number of days to come,"" de Blasio said.  New York state police have increased patrols near synagogues and Jewish establishments, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.  Police officers rush to the scene of an active shooting in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Tuesday.  What the video shows, according to officials  Authorities' latest account of the shootout conflicts with what they said a day earlier. Tuesday, officials initially said the gunfire spanned multiple locations, and CNN affiliates reported the shooting began at a cemetery.  Wednesday, Fulop tried to clarify the timeline.  Police have said the shooting began around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday.  Surveillance video shows a van moving slowly through the city's streets before stopping in front of the store, Fulop said.  ""The perpetrator stopped in front of there, calmly opened the door with two long rifles -- him and the other perpetrator -- and began firing from the street into the facility,"" Fulop said.  ""There were many other (potential) targets available to them that they bypassed to attack that place,"" said Shea, the Jersey City public safety director.  A police officer, three civilians and the two suspects were killed in the shooting, authorities said.  Officers saved lives, officials say  Chaotic scenes ensued when the shooting began. Commerce in the area virtually shut down and schools went on lockdown.  Two police officers happened to be nearby and rushed there immediately. They transmitted information to colleagues and were shot, but they likely saved lives, Shea said. It wasn't immediately clear whether one of them was Seals, the officer who died.  ""Within seconds, more Jersey City police officers responded to their calls, pulled them out of the line of fire and continue to engage the two people carrying guns inside the store,"" Shea said.  ""Had (the two officers) not been there in that location, more than likely more people would have died,"" Fulop said.  City shudders  Grewal, the New Jersey attorney general, said he and his staff are mourning with the city.  ""We recognize the fear that communities rightfully feel after traumatic incidents such as these, and we are committed to providing all resources necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of our fellow residents,"" Grewal said.  Jersey City Public Schools delayed the start of classes Wednesday in the wake of the shooting.  Tuesday evening, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy praised the efforts of law enforcement, who ""responded to this incident not knowing what they were entering, or if they would even make it out.""  ""If not for them,"" Murphy said, ""I shudder, we shudder to think about how much worse today could have been.""  The New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association tweeted: ""We need a lot of prayers right now for Jersey City officers. Keep all those involved in your thoughts.""  Correction: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect name provided by officials for one of the victims.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fund (Unicef) confirmed MalaysiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first case of polio in 27 years on Tuesday.  They said the polio virus contracted by the three-month-old Malaysian boy is the same strain that has been spreading in the southern Philippines since September.  The health ministry today said it will work with the Philippine government and Unicef to source a supply of vaccines.  Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the community will be given 10 types of vaccines as per the National Immunisation Programme.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Philippines can get cheaper prices so we might source the vaccines from them,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said after the opening of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Be a Heart Hero 2019Ã¢â‚¬Â conference by Deputy Health Minister Dr Lee Boon Chye at the National Heart Foundation today.  He voiced concern about the influx of undocumented migrants to East Malaysia, saying that Sabah and Sarawak might have 20% to 30% of undocumented migrants who enter and leave Malaysia without any checks.  Noor Hisham said the Philippines was still using oral polio vaccines (OPV), which Malaysia previously administered until 2008 before switching to inactivated polio vaccines (IPV).  The WHO website states that OPV Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is the main preventive measure against polio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is taken orally as drops and does not require a trained health worker. IPV is given through an injection by a trained health worker.  In countries still using OPV, IPV does not replace the OPV vaccine but is used with OPV to strengthen a childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immune system and protect them from polio.    ",en,diseas,,

A soldier and a militant were killed in two firefights at dawn that allowed troops to rescue the two Indonesians in the mountainous hinterland off Panamao town in Sulu province, said Lieutenant-General Cirilito Sobejana.  Troops, backed by rocket-firing helicopters, were pursuing the militants in an effort to rescue the third Indonesian, he said. ""We have cordoned the area, so we are very optimistic that we will recover the remaining Indonesian,"" Lt-Gen Sobejana told reporters.  The Indonesian fishermen were kidnapped off Malaysia's Sabah state in September by the ransom-seeking militants and taken to their Sulu jungle bases despite tighter security by Malaysian, Philippine and Indonesian forces.  Military offensives against militant groups have reduced abductions in recent years, but they continue to occur. Abu Sayyaf gunmen have staged kidnappings in and off Sabah in recent years, sparking a regional security alarm.  The rescue of the Indonesians came after the military recently inflicted battle defeats on the Abu Sayyaf, which is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the Philippines.  Troops have killed a ""high-value"" but little-known Abu Sayyaf commander, Talha Jumsah, near Sulu's mountainous Patikul town. Jumsah acted as a key link between the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria terror group and local militants, officials said.  ASSOCIATED PRESS",en,terrorattack,,

The strikes targeted the village of Jubass near the town of Saraqeb in southern Idlib province, killing civilians sheltering in a school and nearby, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Children are bearing the brunt of intensifying violence in northwest Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â the United Nations childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organisation Unicef said Tuesday.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nine years into the war, children in Syria continue to experience unspeakable violence, trauma and distress.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Heightened regime and Russian bombardments on southern Idlib since Dec 16 have forced tens of thousands of vulnerable people to flee their homes, according to the UN.  Nearly 80 civilians have been killed by airstrikes and artillery attacks over that same period, according to the Observatory, which puts the number of displaced in recent weeks at more than 40,000.  An uptick in attacks around Saraqeb over the past 24 hours has driven thousands more out, the Observatory added.  The UN has called for Ã¢â‚¬Å“immediate de-escalationÃ¢â‚¬Â and warned of further mass displacement if the violence continues in SyriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last major opposition bastion.  Ground assault    But Russian and regime airstrikes have continued to pummel the region as Damascus loyalists advanced on the ground.  Since Thursday, regime forces have taken control of dozens of towns and villages in southern Idlib following battles with jihadists.  The clashes have killed 260 fighters on both sides, according to the Observatory.  Regime forces are now less than 4km from the strategic city of Maaret al-Numan, the head of the Britain-based monitor, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP.  In a statement on Tuesday, the Syrian army said it has seized 320sqkm from its rivals in recent days, pledging to continue its push until it recaptures all of Idlib.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Syrian army stresses its insistence on cleansing the province of Idlib from terrorism and its sponsors,Ã¢â‚¬Â it said, calling on civilians to exit areas under jihadist control.  Fearing further advances, thousands of Maaret al-NumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s residents have fled towards IdlibÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s north.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I did not expect to have to leave,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Abu Ahmad, poking his head out of the pick-up truck driving him and his family towards a camp for the displaced.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is my home, this is where I grew up,Ã¢â‚¬Â the father of 10 told AFP.  Life-saving assistance  Idlib is dominated by the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former Al-Qaeda affiliate, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.  It hosts some three million people, including many displaced by years of violence in other parts of Syria.  The Damascus regime, which now controls 70% of Syria, has repeatedly vowed to take back the area.  Backed by Moscow, Damascus launched a blistering offensive against Idlib in April, killing around 1,000 civilians and displacing more than 400,000 people.  Despite a ceasefire announced in August, the bombardment has continued, killing hundreds of civilians and fighters.  The latest spike in violence comes after Russia and China on Friday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have extended for a year cross-border aid deliveries to four million Syrians, many of them in Idlib.  The move raised fears that UN-funded assistance could stop entering opposition-held parts of Syria from January unless an alternative agreement is reached.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Humanitarian access must be sustained to provide life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of children everywhere in the northwest and other parts of Syria,Ã¢â‚¬Â Unicef said in a statement.

A little more than a year later, he had to resign after a violent crackdown on protests by security forces and armed militias left hundreds dead and thousands injured.  Since early October, mass demonstrations have been held to demand an end to corruption, better living conditions, independence from regional (mainly Iran) and global (mainly the United States) powers, and the downfall of the entire political system that has been in place in Iraq since the 2003 US invasion.  Although the protests have largely been confined to Baghdad and the Shia-majority areas in central and southern Iraq, the protesters' demands have not been sectarian. And unlike the previous waves of protest movements in Iraq, the current upheaval has been characterised by strong public will, popular agency and belief in the power to change. Importantly, none of the Iraqi parties has been able to coopt the demonstrations.  In addition, protesters have defined their movement as an ''uprising'' or a ''revolution'', which is challenging political legitimacy and current state-society relations. In parallel, they have also labelled the Iraqi authorities as ""the regime"", a word with clear ramifications for the people of this region referring to an authority with no popular support or legitimacy.  What is happening in Iraq is truly remarkable and cannot be compared with any other moment in its recent history. So what got the country to this moment and what happens next?  The roots of an uprising  Chronic and growing dysfunction in three sectors - government, economy and security - is at the heart of the current upheaval in Iraq.  On the political level, the post-2003 system in Iraq is centred on a power-sharing arrangement among the country's three largest ethno-sectarian groups: Shia Arabs, Sunni Arabs and Kurds. According to this informal agreement, the prime minister's post is reserved for a member of the Shia community, the parliament speaker has to be a Sunni, and the president - a Kurd.  On the ground, this system has constrained attempts for meaningful political and administrative reform. As Nechirvan Barzani, president of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), noted recently, the political blocs representing Iraq's three main components have been more interested in their respective constituencies and party politics, than working for the good of the country.  The result is a weak government and a weak prime minister who do not have the full support of political parties and are therefore unable to counter corruption and pursue good governance.  Another weak point of this system is that it has not really allowed for genuine power-sharing. Political power has remained in the hands of dominant Shia actors and has left some groups deeply dissatisfied.  The protests of 2012-13 in Sunni-majority areas, which rejected the perceived sectarian rule of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the KRI's 2017 referendum on independence were signs that this system has not been able to create a sense of equal partnership. The continuing protests in Shia-majority areas demonstrate this system does not satisfy the Shia population either.  On the economic level, the country's continued dependence on its oil resources has prevented sustainable economic development, which, together with the high level of corruption and public mismanagement, has led to the failure of the state to provide for the basic needs of the population.  Successive governments have tried to placate the Iraqi public by expanding the public sector to provide employment for the youth; today two-thirds of the Iraqi budget goes towards paying salaries of government employees. This approach has proven unsustainable and has prevented any real effort being put in diversifying the Iraqi economy and boosting the private sector.  On the security level, Iraq faces major challenges because it does not have unified security and military forces. In addition to the Kurdish Peshmerga and security forces, which operate in a state-within-a-state system and themselves are split along Kurdish party lines, there is a multitude of different forces within the security sector which are not immune to politicisation.  In addition, since 2003, there has been an ever-growing number of militias and armed groups which have wielded significant power within the country and have been instrumentalised by various domestic and foreign powers to pursue their own political interests.  The lack of a unified security force or a ""command and control"" structure in Iraq's armed and security forces has weakened the country, giving space for terrorist groups to proliferate and foreign interference to grow.  What is next?  Today, Iraq finds itself in a major crisis with no clear way out. The Iraqi people have demonstrated that the political elite has lost all popular support and legitimacy. Even religious leaders and institutions, such as Iraq's most senior Shia Muslim leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, which have been unable to unify the Shia parties, are now facing serious criticism.  The problem is, while there is a clear legitimacy vacuum, political actors and militias continue to insist on maintaining their hard power through systems of political and sectarian patronage. These same political actors are also supposed to select a new prime minister and vote on reforms.  So at this point, there seem to be at least two possible scenarios for what happens next.  First, political blocs could agree on a new prime minister who would remain in his post until new elections are held. His mandate would also include passing a new electoral law to satisfy one of the demands of the protesters.  However, given the current makeup of parliament, which lacks a clear partisan majority, the new prime minister will have to be a consensus figure again - ie he would not be able to wield any more power than Abdul Mahdi did. Hence, his attempts to push forward a new electoral law or any reform could be sabotaged by various political blocs.  And as no major party is ready to concede power or position, it is likely they would seek to influence the next elections. Therefore, It is unlikely that this outcome would satisfy the protesters who will likely continue with their anti-government activity.  Second, the parties may not be able to agree on a new prime minister or may clash over the elections, and this could lead to an internal conflict.  Unlike Syria, Iraqi protesters have not resorted to arming themselves, despite the vicious crackdown on their demonstrations. Thus any escalation would be most likely the result of a conflict between Shia armed groups, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's Peace Brigades on one side and the Iranian-backed groups of the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMUs). There are already signs of growing hostility between these groups.  Such a scenario would likely open the scene for even more foreign interference, especially from Iran and the US.  A third scenario - where the demands of the people for radical change are fulfilled - unfortunately, seems unlikely. Vested interests of the main domestic and foreign political actors constitute a big enough force to counter the revolutionary spirit of the streets.  Despite the challenges, popular mobilisation, especially among the youth, has become an important factor in Iraqi politics which is forcing a change in the public discourse on legitimacy. Political actors now face a new political reality and they will have to change their approach to their electorate as pressure from the streets continues.  While the ""downfall of the regime"" will not happen in Iraq, as protesters desire, slow and incremental change in the long term is a significant possibility. The delay of the process and the piecemeal concessions the political elite is likely to give at first will not satisfy the protest movement, which could serve as fuel for continuing popular mobilisation.

Air attacks on November 14 targeted the home of Rasmi Abu Malhous, a Palestinian Authority (PA) employee in Gaza, and his brother Mohamed.  More:  Nine members of the Sawarka family were killed by four attacks over their home in Deir al-Balah. Five victims were children.  The air raids killed Rasmi, his second wife Maryam, 45, and three of his 11 children - three-year-old Salim, Mohannad, 12, and three-month-old Firas.  The bombing also killed Mohamed's wife Yousra, 39, and two of their sons, Moaaz, seven, and Waseem, 13. Mohamed died on November 22 as a result of his wounds.  They were among 34 Palestinians killed by Israeli air raids over the Gaza Strip during two days of cross-border fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad group. At least 63 Israelis also received treatment for injuries from rocket fire from Gaza.  The Israeli army claimed it targeted the house of a military commander belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed group, an allegation rejected by the victims' family.  Israeli statement  In its statement on Tuesday, the Israeli army said intelligence collected ahead of the attack had indicated that the residence ""was designated as an Islamic Jihad terror organisation military compound"".  The army had ""estimated"" that ""civilians would not be harmed as a result of an attack"" on the site, which was not believed to be accessible to members of the public.  191202055310940  An army inquiry later found ""that even though military activity was conducted in the compound, it was not a closed compound, and in reality, civilians were present there,"" it said.  The army said it would learn from its ""mistakes"" to reduce ""the recurrence of similar irregular events.""  It stressed it had made ""considerable efforts ... to reduce the damage to non-combatants"".  The military report also blamed Islamic Jihad for exploiting and endangering non-combatants ""by placing its military assets in the heart of the civilian population and by deliberately acting from within densely populated civilian areas.""  The Israeli army claimed it targeted the house of a military commander belonging to Islamic Jihad, an allegation rejected by the victims' family [File: Mohammed Saber/EPA]  False Israeli claims  The two sides began exchanging fire after Israel killed Islamic Jihad top commander Bahaa Abu al-Ata in Gaza. In response, Islamic Jihad fired rockets into southern Israel, with Israel's military saying it recorded more than 350 projectiles.  A ceasefire, reportedly brokered by Egypt, was declared the morning after the Sawarka family was targeted.  Mohamad Awad, a member of the Sawarka Bedouin tribe and a neighbour of the family, told Al Jazeera the Israeli bombing was a ""war crime"" because Rasmi and his brother Mohamed were civilians and had nothing to do with any armed groups.  191114174542294  ""They raised sheep and were barely making ends meet before they were killed,"" he said.  Awad denied the Israeli army's claim that Rasmi was a member of Islamic Jihad, and said he was an employee of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority (PA) government.  In its Tuesday report, the Israeli army claimed its November operation was an overall success, dealing a blow to Islamic Jihad and increasing the security of Israeli civilians.  In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee said on Twitter the attack targeted the head of the Islamic Jihad's rocket unit, whom he identified as Rasmi Abu Malhous.  ""Rasmi Abu Malhous, leader of Islamic Jihad and the commander of the rocket unit in the central Gaza brigade, was the target of last night in the raid on Deir al-Balah,"" Adraee said.  Israeli newspaper Haaretz had quoted an Israeli army official as saying Adraee's claim appeared to have been based on false rumours spread online.",en,terrorattack,,
3613191,rappler,None,Burkina Faso in mourning amid wave of jihadist attacks,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/rappler/~3/GUta27g9UVI/247966-burkina-faso-mourning-wave-jihadist-attacks-december-2019,,26/12/2019 16:15,"OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Burkina Faso was in mourning Wednesday, December 25, after a wave of jihadist attacks left 35 civilians, mostly women, and dozens of soldiers dead in the troubled West African country.  Security sources told AFP Wednesday that ""around a dozen soldiers were killed"" in an attack overnight in Hallele in the volatile northern province of Soum.  Seven soldiers also died in simultaneous attacks Tuesday, December 24, on the northern town of Arbinda and a military base, which lasted several hours and were of a ""rare intensity,"" the army said, while 80 assailants were killed.  Burkina Faso, bordering Mali and Niger, has seen frequent jihadist attacks which have left hundreds of people dead since the start of 2015 when Islamist extremist violence began to spread across the Sahel region.  ""A large group of terrorists simultaneously attacked the military base and the civilian population in Arbinda,"" the army chief of staff said in a statement.  ""This barbaric attack resulted in the deaths of 35 civilian victims, most of them women,"" President Roch Marc Christian Kabore added on Twitter, which was one of the deadliest assaults in nearly 5 years of violence.  Government spokesman Remis Dandjinou said 31 of the civilian victims were women, and that around 20 soldiers and 6 civilians were wounded.  The president has declared 48 hours of national mourning.  There was worldwide condemnation of the attack, as well as expressions of support for Burkina Faso.  Pope's prayers  In his traditional Christmas message, Pope Francis denounced attacks on Christians in Africa and prayed for victims of conflict, natural disasters, and disease on the world's poorest continent.  The pontiff urged ""comfort to those who are persecuted for their religious faith, especially missionaries and members of the faithful who have been kidnapped, and to the victims of attacks by extremist groups, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria.""  In Brussels, the head of the European Council Charles Michel tweeted: ""Inates in Niger yesterday, Arbinda in Burkina Faso today... Martyr towns, victims of a rampant terrorism that threatens us all. The European Union stands by Africa in its battle against terrorism.""  Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou also expressed his ""solidarity"" and, speaking ""in the name of the Nigerien people,"" offered his ""condolences for all civilian and military victims.""  The morning raid in Burkina was carried out by more than 200 jihadists on motorbikes, triggering a fierce firefight that lasted about 3 hours before armed forces backed by the air force drove the militants back, a security source said.  No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bloodshed, but jihadist violence in Burkina Faso has been blamed on militants linked to both Al-Qaeda and Islamic State groups.  560,000 internally displaced  Leaders of the G5 Sahel nations held summit talks in Niger earlier this month, calling for closer cooperation and international support in the battle against the Islamist threat.  France is also hosting another meeting next month.  Militant violence has spread across the vast Sahel region, especially in Burkina Faso and Niger, having started when armed Islamists revolted in northern Mali in 2012.  The Sahel region of Africa lies to the south of the Sahara Desert and stretches across the breadth of the African continent.  There are 4,500 French troops deployed in the region as well as a 13,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force in Mali to fight insurgents, backing up national forces of the G5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger.  In Burkina Faso, more than 700 people have been killed and around 560,000 internally displaced, according to the UN.  Attacks have targeted mostly the north and east of the country, though the capital Ouagadougou has been hit 3 times.  Prior to Tuesday's attack, Burkina security forces said they had killed around 100 jihadists in several operations since November.  An ambush on a convoy transporting employees of a Canadian mining company in November killed 37 people.  Attacks have intensified this year as the under-equipped, poorly trained Burkina Faso army struggles to contain the Islamist militancy. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,,

A video released on Thursday showed members of the Nigerian affiliate slashing the throats of 10 people and shooting an additional person. A voice-over says the killings are a Ã¢â‚¬Å“message for ChristiansÃ¢â‚¬Â and that all of those killed were Christian, although Nigerian experts said some of them were probably Muslims, based on previous episodes involving the group.  The Islamic State, or ISIS, has lost all of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, but it remains a threat even after Mr. al-Baghdadi was killed in an American raid on his hide-out in northwestern Syria. In addition to the affiliate in Nigeria, which is known as the Islamic State West Africa Province, groups in the Philippines, Afghanistan, Sinai and the Sahel, a 3,000-mile stretch of land south of the Sahara, also claim allegiance to ISIS.  The members of the Islamic State West Africa Province, which is known by the acronym ISWAP, left the Islamic militant group Boko Haram in 2016. According to the International Crisis Group, it has between 3,500 and 5,000 fighters. Its leaders split from Boko Haram in part because they disapproved of the violence that the group and its harsh leader, Abubakar Shekau, has meted out to Muslims, according to analysts.",en,terrorattack,876,['Nigeria']

Images taken at the scene showed a mass of mangled vehicles below clouds of black smoke.  Image: A woman is pictured among bystanders at the scene of the attack  Survivors described the intensity of the explosion as being similar to when a truck bomb detonated in the city two years earlier, leaving more than 500 dead.

""I have never seen such an explosion in my entire life.""  No group has yet said it was behind the attack but it bears all the hallmarks of al-Shabab.  The extremist group, which controls parts of the country, has a history of targeting the city's infrastructure, including checkpoints and hotels, since it was pushed out of Mogadishu several years ago.  The latest bombing will raise questions over whether Somali forces are ready and able to replace an African Union force that has been responsible for boosting security.

The victims were stabbed in the basement of Hasidic Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg's home in Monsey at around 10pm on Saturday, the seventh night of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.

Eight people were also injured in the attack on Sunday, according to local health authority figures quoted by the Security Belt group.  More:  No claim of responsibility had yet been made, but the media office of the southern forces said the blast was caused by a Houthi missile.  The Security Belt forces are part of a southern separatist front in southern Yemen and are backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the fight against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group.  Witnesses told Reuters News Agency that an explosion took place near a guest platform during the parade and that dozens were injured or killed. They reported seeing bodies at the scene.  Al Jazeera's Mohammed al-Attab, reporting from the capital Sanaa, said that al-Dhalea is a ""battlefield"" between the Houthis and the internationally-recognised government forces.  ""On previous occasions, the Houthis have carried out attacks on military parades,"" al-Attab said. ""But al-Qaeda is also active in the area.""  Meanwhile, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saria on Sunday said six ""sensitive"" places in Saudi Arabia and three in the UAE are on a list of military targets, suggesting the group remains prepared to fight on despite informal talks about a truce in Yemen's war.  The priority targets were said to be ""vital and sensitive"" locations, Saria said without giving more details, during a round-up of the group's activities during 2019 and outlook for 2020.  The Houthis have repeatedly said they have targets in Saudi and the UAE in their sights and have carried out missile and drone strikes on civilian airports and oil infrastructure in Saudi, as well as on the capital Riyadh.  In August, the group claimed responsibility for a missile and drone attack on a parade in Aden, the seat of the internationally-recognised government, that killed around 36 people, including a prominent commander.  Yemen has suffered from almost five years of conflict since the Houthi movement overthrew President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government in late 2014. The coup drew military intervention in 2015 by a Saudi- UAE-led coalition, trying to restore Hadi's internationally-recognised government.

The unprecedented attack on the American mission in Baghdad Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in which intruders threw rocks, laid fires and graffitied walls Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sparked fears of a wider proxy war between Iran and the United States, both of them close allies of Iraq.  Supporters of IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi military force laid siege to the embassy in outrage at US airstrikes that killed 25 of their fighters, but pulled back on Wednesday after an order from the group.  On Thursday, more than a dozen black armoured vehicles of the US-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service deployed on the embassyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s streets in the capitalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Green Zone to reinforce security there.  Pro-Iran slogans still covered the entire length of the thick concrete walls breached by the mob.  But the Hashed flags planted by protesters on the embassyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outer walls, as well as photographs of the killed fighters put up in mourning, had been cleared away according to an AFP correspondent.  Embassy staff could be seen cleaning up a reception area the protesters had broken into and torched, and cranes were used to move rocks and debris they had pelted at the embassy.  The attack sparked comparisons with the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran and the deadly 2012 attack on the US consulate in LibyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second city Benghazi.  The Pentagon warned that the Iran-backed group that stormed the embassy would carry out more attacks on US facilities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and would regret it.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The provocative behaviour has been out there for months,Ã¢â‚¬Â said US Defence Secretary Mark Esper.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“So, do I think they may do something? Yes. And they will likely regret it.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are prepared to exercise self-defence, and we are prepared to deter further bad behaviour from these groups, all of which are sponsored, directed and resourced by Iran.Ã¢â‚¬Â  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still here  The violence has also troubled Iraqis who have taken to the streets since October in massive rallies denouncing government corruption, a lack of jobs and poor public services.  The largest grassroots protests Iraq in decades has seen tens of thousands flooding the streets across the capital and Shiite-majority south.  Nearly 460 people have been killed and around 25,000 wounded in protest-related violence.  Demonstrators have worried that the dramatic developments outside the US embassy would either steal their thunder or be mistaken for an extension of their own movement.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“What happened in front of the US embassy was an attempt to draw peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes away from the popular protests now in their fourth month,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ahmed Mohammad Ali, a student protester in the southern hotspot city of Nasiriyah.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still here, protesting for change and hoping for victory,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told AFP.  AliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determination came despite the attempted killings of two activists in Nasiriyah overnight, both of whom survived.  An activist in Baghdad was not so fortunate: Saadoun al-Luhaybi was shot in the head in a southwestern neighbourhood of the capital overnight, a police source told AFP on Thursday.  Around a dozen activists have died in targeted killings across Iraq in what demonstrators say is an intimidation campaign meant to scare them into halting their movement.  Many have persisted, and rallies rocked the southern city of Diwaniyah on Thursday.  Protesters there have shut most government offices but briefly allowed some to reopen this week to allow employees receive their end-of-year salaries.  New rules of the game  The attack on the embassy highlighted new strains in the US-Iraqi relationship, which officials from both countries have described to AFP as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“coldestÃ¢â‚¬Â in years.  The United States led the 2003 invasion against then-dictator Saddam Hussein and has worked closely with Iraqi officials since.  But its influence has waned compared with that of Tehran, which has long and carefully crafted personal ties with Iraqi politicians and armed factions, even during SaddamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign.  Both Washington and Tehran backed Iraqi security forces fighting the Islamic State (IS) group, but the two have been at loggerheads since the United States pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal with Iran in 2018.  Iraqi officials have feared that their country could be used as an arena for score-settling between Iran an the US.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Before this episode, there was an agreement that in post-IS Iraq, the US and Iran donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t attack each other directly,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Renad Mansour, an expert at the London-based Chatham House.

Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force and mastermind of its regional influence, was killed early on Friday near Baghdad's international airport in an air strike ordered by US President Donald Trump.  More:  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei paid tribute to him as a ""martyr"" and promised to exact ""harsh revenge"".  He announced three days of national mourning in honour of Soleimani, who was widely believed to be the second-most powerful figure in Iran.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani echoed the threat of revenge and vowed that there would be consequences. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif condemned the killing as an ""act of state terrorism"" in a statement.  ""The pure blood of Qassem Soleimani will surely strengthen the tree of resistance, unite the Iranian people, and make US policies in the region less effective by the day,"" he said.  Iran's National Security Council has convened an emergency meeting to decide Iran's reaction to the killing. Reports say Khamenei has participated in the meeting for the first time ever, denoting the gravity of the situation.  Iran's supreme leader appointed Esmail Qaani as the new head of the IRGC's foreign operations on Friday.  ""Following the martyrdom of the glorious General Haj Qasem Soleimani, I name Brigadier General Esmail Qaani as the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement posted on his official website.  Several local news sources have reported that a number of Iranian fighter jets are patrolling the western parts of the country, which border Iraq.  The US air strike was a dramatic escalation of tensions with Iran, which have been continuously growing since Trump unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in May last year and imposed crippling sanctions.  'Hero' remembered  IRGC officials, clerics, ministers, members of parliament, and the business community reacted in unison and hailed the commander as a fallen hero.  Gatherings are being organised in Tehran and across the country after Friday prayers to commemorate Soleimani and denounce the US and Israel.  State broadcaster IRIB and radio channels were allotting almost their entire broadcast time to news of Soleimani's assassination and programmes commemorating him. All television presenters wore black and a black strip adorned the top corner of the screens.  An IRIB presenter, who was interviewing IRGC spokesman Ramezan Sharif, kissed his uniform and embraced him as they broke down in tears.  All comedy films slated to be showed in cinemas were postponed and all music concerts were temporarily suspended.  A major passageway in Tehran, which has yet to be announced, will be named after Soleimani, officials said.  ""The assassination of Qassem Soleimani has definitely enraged a majority of Iranians, irrespective of political beliefs,"" said Ali Akbar Dareini, an expert on Iran-US affairs at the Center for Strategic Studies in Tehran.  Soleimani was the most popular political figure in Iran, according to several local and external polls. The latest, a poll commissioned by the Center of International and Security Studies at Maryland University, found that Soleimani had increased his influence, with eight in 10 respondents saying they view him favourably.  'Declaration of war'  ""The unilateral US sanctions were a declaration of economic war and this reckless move is obviously a major escalation and a declaration of war against Iran,"" Dareini told Al Jazeera.  The White House and Pentagon said the attack on Soleimani was carried out with the aim of deterring future attacks allegedly being planned by Iran.  The Pentagon said Trump had ordered Soleimani's ""killing"" after pro-Iran protesters this week stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad.  But Dareini believes the attack will lead to more insecurity and violence across the Middle East ""exactly contrary to what the Americans claim"".    ""This is also a gift to Daesh and all terrorists in the region,"" the political analyst said.  Soleimani, along with Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a key figure in Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) who was also killed in the air strikes, were instrumental to the two countries' fight against ISIL (ISIS).  ""After him [Soleimani], the political, security and military red lines of the region will be transformed,"" tweeted Hesammodin Ashna, a top adviser to President Rouhani.

The killing of IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Major General Qasem Soleimani on Friday was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the United States, which pledged to send thousands more troops to the region.  Iraqi political leaders and clerics attended the mass ceremony to honour 62-year-old Soleimani and the other nine victims of the pre-dawn attack on Baghdad international airport, including Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.  US President Donald Trump said Friday he had decided to Ã¢â‚¬Å“terminateÃ¢â‚¬Â IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military mastermind to prevent an Ã¢â‚¬Å“imminentÃ¢â‚¬Â attack on US diplomats and troops.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,Ã¢â‚¬Â he insisted.  But the strike Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which killed four more Iranian Guards and five members of IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network Ã¢â‚¬â€œ infuriated Iran, whose ambassador to the United Nations, Majid Takht Ravanchi, called it an Ã¢â‚¬Å“act of warÃ¢â‚¬Â by its arch-enemy.  On Saturday, the Hashed said a new strike had hit a convoy of their forces north of Baghdad, with Iraqi state media blaming the US.  But US-led coalition spokesman Myles Caggins denied involvement, telling AFP: Ã¢â‚¬Å“There was no American or coalition strike.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Mourning procession  Mass ceremonies started in Baghdad Saturday for Soleimani Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a veteran military figure revered as a hero by many in Iran and the region Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the other victims of FridayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack.  IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caretaker premier Adel Abdel Mahdi joined Muhandis associate Hadi al-Ameri, Shiite cleric Ammar al-Hakim, former PM Nuri al-Maliki and other pro-Iran figures in large crowds accompanying the coffins.  The coffins were first brought to a revered Shiite shrine in northern Baghdad, where thousands of mourners chanted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death to America!Ã¢â‚¬Â.  Dressed in black, they waved white Hashed flags and massive portraits of Iranian and Iraqi leaders, furiously calling for Ã¢â‚¬Å“revengeÃ¢â‚¬Â.  The crowds headed south to a point near the Green Zone, the high-security district home to government offices and foreign embassies, including AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.  The remains will later be taken to the Shiite holy city of Najaf to the south, and the remains of the Guards will then be flown to Iran, which has declared three days of mourning.  As head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard CorpsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ foreign operations arm, Soleimani was a powerful figure domestically and oversaw wide-ranging Iranian involvement in regional power struggles.  Soleimani had long been considered a lethal foe by Washington, with Trump saying he should have been killed Ã¢â‚¬Å“many years agoÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Tehran has already named SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deputy, Esmail Qaani, to replace him.  His first order of business was made clear Friday when IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised Ã¢â‚¬Å“severe revengeÃ¢â‚¬Â for SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.  US scales back ops  Iraqi paramilitary figures including US-blacklisted Qais al-Khazaali and militiaman-turned-politician Moqtada Sadr have called on their fighters to Ã¢â‚¬Å“be readyÃ¢â‚¬Â.  And, elsewhere in the region, LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tehran-backed Shiite movement Hezbollah threatened Ã¢â‚¬Å“punishment for these criminal assassinsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Amid the tensions, the Pentagon said up to 3,500 additional US troops would be dispatched to IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s southern neighbour Kuwait, to boost some 14,000 reinforcements already deployed to the region last year.  There are approximately 5,200 US troops stationed across Iraq to train Iraqis to fight jihadists.  They have faced a spate of rocket attacks that the US has blamed on pro-Iran factions and which last month killed an American contractor.  On Saturday, a US official told AFP the US-led forces were scaling back operations and refocusing surveillance to watch for new rocket attacks.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our first priority is protecting coalition personnel,Ã¢â‚¬Â the official said, saying there would be only Ã¢â‚¬Å“limitedÃ¢â‚¬Â training and anti-jihadist operations for now.  US citizens were meanwhile urged to leave Iraq immediately and American staff were being evacuated from oil fields in the south.  Abdel Mahdi warned Friday that the US strike would Ã¢â‚¬Å“spark a devastating war in IraqÃ¢â‚¬Â, while President Barham Saleh pleaded for Ã¢â‚¬Å“voices of reasonÃ¢â‚¬Â to prevail.  Pro-Iran factions in Iraq have seized on SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death to push parliament to revoke the security agreement allowing for the deployment of US forces on Iraqi soil.  Iraqi lawmakers were to convene in emergency session on Sunday and expected to hold a vote.  Analysts said the US strike, which sent world oil prices soaring, would be a game-changer.  Phillip Smyth, a US-based specialist on Shiite armed groups, described the killing as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most major decapitation strike that the US has ever pulled offÃ¢â‚¬Â.  He expected Ã¢â‚¬Å“biggerÃ¢â‚¬Â ramifications than either the 2011 operation that killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden or the 2019 raid that killed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

His picture adorned billboards of cities liberated from ISIS, and militia commanders boasted about their battlefield selfies with him and trips into Iran and Syria aboard his private aircraft. He was combat-hardened and untouchable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or so he may have thought.  Before dawn Friday, a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone fired missiles into a convoy carrying Soleimani, soon after his arrival at the Baghdad international airport. Photographs of his charred skeleton quickly surfaced, along with a flurry of questions in America and around the world.  Top U.S. officials on both sides of the aisle say they were blindsided by the move. They are demanding answers about the extreme secrecy shrouding the planning of the attack and its potential consequences.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We had no awareness, no indication; we were not informed and knew nothing until after it happened,Ã¢â‚¬Â one high-ranking Baghdad official told Fox News.  AFTER SOLEIMANI: CELEBRATIONS, CYBER-ATTACKS, AND THREATS TO KICK US TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ  Soleimani had long been deemed an enemy of the United States with American blood on his hands, and no U.S.officials or political leaders mourned his demise.  But the drone strike, signed off on by President Donald Trump, immediately sparked threats of severe reprisals by Iran, pushing the U.S. to the brink of war.  Knowing at least some of the likely fallout, why target Soleimani now?  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strike sought to curb an Ã¢â‚¬Å“imminent attackÃ¢â‚¬Â that threatened Americans in the region, including diplomats and troops. He told Fox News on Friday that it was an Ã¢â‚¬Å“intelligence-based assessment.Ã¢â‚¬Â  A source who worked closely with officials in shaping U.S Syria policy said there were indications that a Soleimani-designed attack was looming.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“He was working to destroy U.S. interests in many countries, pushing for a new government in Iraq more friendly to Iran and destroy the reputation of Trump,Ã¢â‚¬Â the source said.  Yet many Washington insiders and defense experts remain skeptical about whether those attacks were truly imminent.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I believe we have had plans [to eliminate Soleimani] all along. The attack on the U.S. embassy was the trigger to get that ball rolling,Ã¢â‚¬Â said a former Pentagon official and Middle East expert, who spoke on background.  NY TIMES REPORTER'S TWEET OF SOLEIMANI RECITING POETRY DRAWS BACKLASH  The drone attack also killed Soleimani adviser Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, whose militia has been linked to the attacks less than a week ago that killed an American contractor in Kirkuk.  According to Jenna Ben-Yehuda, president of the Truman National Security Project and a former State Department official who worked with the Defense Department, the lead-up to SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slaying under the Trump banner has been building for some time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ starting with Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Then his move to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization in April 2019, the first time the U.S. has ever given that designation to an element of a foreign government, makes Thursday's attack part of a destabilizing chain of events,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“While Secretary of State Pompeo has asserted that the U.S. made the decision to strike on Thursday in response to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœimminent threatsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ against U.S. personnel and assets, the fact that he appears not to have provided the public, Congress, or allies with additional information about those threats casts doubts on the veracity of his claim,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ben-Yehuda added.  WASHINGTON POST BLASTED FOR REFERRING TO QASSIM SOLEIMANI AS IRAN'S 'MOST REVERED MILITARY LEADER'  Kenneth Pollack, a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute, believes the decision to go ahead with the strike came down to having reliable intelligence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where the target would be and when Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and little risk to civilian lives.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We know Qassem may have been planning an attack in general terms, but we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about when and how. I would say we got an intel hit. He was going to be at the airport, on a VIP access road, late at night when civilians were not around and an easy target,Ã¢â‚¬Â Pollack said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The opportunity was too good to pass up.Ã¢â‚¬Â  On Friday, former National Security Advisor John Bolton suggested that the operation was not a last-minute decision.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Long in the making, this was a decisive blow against Iran's malign Quds Force activities worldwide,Ã¢â‚¬Â he tweeted. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Luke Coffey, director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, said it is likely that the U.S. was just waiting for the right opportunity to strike.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“For years, Soleimani has been wreaking havoc across the Middle East. He has American blood dripping from his hands. It was inevitable that he would meet his fate in this manner someday,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  While the Pentagon has remained mum on details of the strike, Iranian media reported that Soleimani had just touched down after a flight from Lebanon. Soleimani was certainly no stranger to Iraq, which borders Iran. He was routinely spotted with officials in Baghdad, and periodically visited the northern Kurdish region to discuss border security and military issues.  Soleimani is believed to have evaded several assassination attempts at the hands of Western, Israeli, and Saudi-connected operatives in recent decades. Both the Bush and Obama administrations passed up other opportunities to kill him, out of concern for retaliation and an escalation of Middle East tensions.  Multiple sources in Iraq indicated that Soleimani was well aware that the U.S. had passed on previous chances to kill him, perhaps fueling his feelings of invincibility.  Unlike other wanted men and terrorist leaders who spent their final years in hiding, Soleimani's actions seemed brazen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even personally joining battles to liberate Christian areas from ISIS in Syria Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a move calculated to build popular support. The fact that Soleimani and al-Muhandis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ two major figureheads Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were traveling together shows their level of comfort in Iraq.  .MICHAEL PREGENT: TRUMP CONFRONTS IRAN WILL STRENGTH - OBAMA SHOWED WEAKNESS AND IRAN BECAME MORE DANGEROUS  While the calculus from the White House is that the killing of the ruthless commander will scare Tehran into toeing the line, there is no way to predict the ramifications across Iraq and beyond.  Last year, the Trump administration officially designated IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a terrorist organization. Iran responded by branding all American troops terrorists. The State Department-issued label also came with expanded authorities to hone in on Iranian assets on Iraqi soil, but the elite Quds Force unit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global intelligence wing and run by Soleimani Ã¢â‚¬â€œ first received the terror tag in 2007.  While the 62-year-old Soleimani had been a favorite child of the clerical regime since the bitter Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and climbed into the top commander position in 1998, his face was not known publically until around 2013 when Iran took on a prominent role fighting on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad next door in Syria.  One high-ranking defense official, who works closely with the U.S. military, said the assassination came as a shock, and even after the news broke, efforts to acquire further information about the strike were met with radio silence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trump made the decision in secrecy, and we condemn it,Ã¢â‚¬Â the official lamented.  But others said action to neutralize Soleimani had to be taken quickly because IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dominance in Iraq was reaching a critical danger point.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The recent protests and even attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, controlled and coordinated by Iran and having under its command KataÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ib Hezbollah, was a clear show of the starting of a wave of direct attacks against U.S. and allied strategic interests, which began with the Iranian-sponsored attack on an Iraqi base that killed an American contractor and wounded American troops,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Johan Obdola, president of the Canada-based Global Organization for Intelligence. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is obvious Iran is planning other major attacks against the U.S.Ã¢â‚¬Â  GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The tensions between Washington and Tehran have been rising for months, but the recent incidences in Iraq Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the death of a U.S. contractor in Kirkuk and the attack against the U.S. embassy in particular probably contributed significantly to the U.S. decision to go after Soleimani directly,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Naysan Rafati, an Iran analyst for the International Crisis Group.",en,terrorattack,,

His comments followed the US assassination of Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, in a drone strike.  Iran has vowed to avenge his killing.  Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that Iran ""is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets"" in response to the general's death.  He said the US had identified 52 Iranian sites, some ""at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD"" if Tehran strikes at the US.  ""The USA wants no more threats!"" Trump added.  The president said the 52 targets represented the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for more than a year from late 1979, after they were seized at the US embassy in Tehran.  Shortly after Mr Trump's tweets, a US government website appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself ""Iran Cyber Security Group Hackers"".  A message on the American Federal Depository Library Programme site read: ""This is a message from the Islamic Republic of Iran.  ""We will not stop supporting our friends in the region: the oppressed people of Palestine, the oppressed people of Yemen, the people and the Syrian government, the people and government of Iraq, the oppressed people of Bahrain, the true Mujahideen resistance in Lebanon and Palestine, [they] will always be supported by us.""  The web page contained a doctored image of President Trump, depicting him being hit in the face and bleeding at the mouth.  What happened earlier on Saturday?  Mr Trump's tweets followed a huge funeral procession for General Soleimani held in Baghdad, where he was killed on Friday.  Mourners waved Iraqi and militia flags and chanted ""death to America"".  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thousands took to the streets of Kerman to mourn Gen Soleimani, a popular figure in Iran  Several rocket attacks shook the area shortly after the procession, including one in the Green Zone near the US embassy.  The Iraqi military said nobody had been hurt. No group has yet said it was behind the development. Pro-Iranian militants have been blamed for other recent attacks.  With Iran already threatening harsh reprisals for the killing of the Quds Force commander, President Trump has clearly determined that the best way to de-escalate is to raise the stakes in advance, making clear what will happen if Tehran follows through on its threats.  The Trump tweet is curious in many ways - not least the symbolic mention of 52 Iranian targets being held at risk - a reference to the 52 US hostages seized in the US Embassy in Tehran back in November 1979.  His mention of targets important ""to the Iranian culture"" suggests a much wider target list than just leadership, military or economic sites.  President Trump is struggling to establish some kind of deterrence. But the ball is now very clearly in Iran's court and it is very hard to see how Tehran can fail to act.  Mr Trump has pursued a contradictory policy ever since he abandoned the nuclear agreement with Tehran - increasing economic pressure, threatening military action, but actually doing very little, even when Iran shot down a sophisticated US drone and struck oil installations in Saudi Arabia.  Above all, he has repeatedly underscored his and Washington's fatigue with its military involvement in the region. This as much as anything else has undermined US deterrence, something Mr Trump is now seeking, belatedly, to restore.  Why did the US kill Soleimani?  General Soleimani was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran, behind Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The 62-year-old spearheaded Iran's Middle East operations as head of the elite Quds Force, and was hailed as a heroic national figure.  But the US branded the commander and the Quds Force terrorists, holding them responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US personnel.  Speaking on Friday afternoon, President Trump said Soleimani was ""plotting imminent and sinister attacks"" on US diplomats and military personnel in Iraq and elsewhere in the region.  Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Soleimani was seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran  The general was killed by an air strike at Baghdad airport early on Friday, on the orders of President Trump.

Qassem Soleimani last week is the latest move in a low-level war between Iran and the U.S. that has been waged with varying degrees of intensity for over 40 years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and is likely to continue long into the future.  Some people fear that recent events will escalate the long conflict into a costly all-out war between the two countries. Others may welcome what they see as the necessary and inevitable showdown leading ultimately to regime change in Tehran.  The killing of Soleimani Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the most prominent military figure in Iran and close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can be seen as an escalation and will almost certainly provoke Iranian retaliation. President TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boast of ordering the killing of Soleimani may further increase pressure on Iran to respond.  NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER O'BRIEN WARNS IRAN OF 'SEVERE CONSEQUENCES' FOR RETALIATION: 'VERY BAD PATH FOR THEM TO GO DOWN'  But although Iranian retaliation for SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killing and counterretaliation by the U.S. seem likely Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and politically advantageous to both governments Ã¢â‚¬â€œTehran and Washington have good reasons to inflict limited pain without engaging in a full-scale war.  Iran has little interest in beginning an all-out war in which Iran itself would suffer major damage. While IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaders describe Soleimani as a martyr, the regime does not seek martyrdom.  The U.S. must expect some immediate spontaneous terrorist attacks, but IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership takes a longer view. Its paramount objective is survival.  And while the Trump administration may want to deter the Iranians from creating politically dangerous situations for the U.S. government and distract attention from the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own domestic political problems, Trump has made clear his opposition to becoming involved in another costly Middle East war. Indeed, he claims that killing Soleimani was necessary to prevent a war.  The past may be prologue to the future. Iran is a master of hybrid warfare. It has used proxies and its own covert operatives to carry out kidnappings and terrorist bombings, sabotage ships at sea and oil facilities on land, blow up embassies, and assassinate government officials. Its reach is global.  Iran can operate on the cyber battlefield as well to torment the United States without offering a clear-cut justification for war. And Iran is well aware of President TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s domestic political problems and AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s election cycle.  Iran has already forced the United States to evacuate diplomats from Iraq, warn U.S. citizens to get out of Iraq, and deploy thousands of additional troops to the Middle East. It can try to create additional crises that draw the United States into further military commitments.  The Iranian regime can also create problems for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s few remaining allies in the region Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies. It can persuade AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increasingly worried allies elsewhere to distance themselves from Washington. AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adversaries will benefit.  At the other end of the spectrum, Iran may further accelerate its nuclear weapons program. And if it has not already done so, American military threats could persuade Iran to initiate a parallel clandestine effort to quickly fabricate and secretly deploy a crude nuclear device as a deterrent or instrument of revenge if the regime is overthrown.  Without risking an all-out war, IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership can distract attention from its own domestic problems, provoke widespread fear and alarm among Americans as well as U.S. allies, and weaken the United States.  One can understand the apprehension in Washington when Iraqi militias and mobs under Iranian control stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday. Any assault on a U.S. diplomatic facility can turn into another Benghazi, where in 2012 Libyan terrorists murdered the ambassador and three other Americans.  From a domestic political perspective, the worst thing to happen would be the takeover of an American embassy in Baghdad or elsewhere that resulted in a protracted hostage crisis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a repeat of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in the Iranian capital of Tehran.  Many blame President CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landslide defeat in the 1980 presidential election on his administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inability to rescue or negotiate the release of the 52 American hostages held by Iranians for 444 days.  The episode taught American presidents that extended hostage situations are politically dangerous.  We do not know what Gen. Soleimani was planning when he was killed while meeting with the head of the militia forces behind the assault on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The militia leader was also killed by the American drone.  But everyone in government knows the history. Taking over embassies crosses a red line for any administration.  Iran has a long history of low-level war with the U.S., going back to the creation of the Islamic Republic in the 1979 revolution that replaced the government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had maintained good relations with the U.S.  The hostage crisis in Tehran was just the first of many anti-American actions by the revolutionary government.  Over 30 years ago, IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps exploited discontent among LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shiites to field proxies who were responsible for the 1983 bombing of the Marine Barracks in Lebanon, in which 241 U.S. service members died.  Iranian-supported Shiite militants also carried out a series of assassinations and kidnappings of Americans and others in Lebanon, creating political crises in Western capitals throughout the 1980s.  President Ronald ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s administration was politically wounded by the scandal that resulted from the revelation that it had secretly sold arms to Iran in exchange for IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assistance in bringing about the release of American hostages. But as some American hostages were released, more Americans were kidnapped.  Iran continues to engage in Ã¢â‚¬Å“detainee diplomacyÃ¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ holding American citizens and dual nationals as currency for future negotiations. The regime might step up its kidnappings in the wake of the killing of Soleimani.  From TehranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective, its actions against Washington were in response to continued American hostility, as well the continued U.S. presence in the Middle East.  Decades ago IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership saw its arch-foe Iraq as an American puppet and believed that the United States encouraged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to invade Iran in 1980. Initially neutral in the contest, the U.S. later tilted toward Iraq, removing it from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and thereby facilitating the shipment of arms and other forms of assistance to Baghdad.  When Iraqi aircraft attacked Iranian oil facilities, Iran retaliated by attacking Kuwaiti ships carrying Iraqi oil. Kuwait appealed to the United States for assistance. Kuwaiti tankers were re-flagged as U.S. vessels and were escorted in the Persian Gulf by U.S. warships.  Iran responded to this by secretly mining the gulf and some of the reflagged vessels were damaged. The U.S. retaliated by attacking Iranian vessels and oil platforms that were being used by IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Revolutionary Guards to coordinate the Iranian campaign.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER  The secret war continued into the 1990s. FBI investigators concluded that Iran had instigated the bombing of Khobar Barracks in Saudi Arabia in which 19 American airmen were killed; nearly 500 others in the Air Force were injured by a gigantic truck bomb.  Iran also supported anti-American Shiite militias during the U.S. occupation of Iraq, which were responsible for more than 600 American deaths.  Hezbollah had Iranian support when it launched a new wave of terrorist attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide. The attacks began after Imad Mugniyah Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a senior Hezbollah operative called a legend by Soleimani and the man responsible for the kidnappings of westerners in Lebanon and terrorist attacks on American and Israeli targets Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was killed by a bomb. The Hezbollah campaign included bombings and assassinations.  In 2011, Iranian operatives were also reportedly involved in a plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Washington with a bomb that would certainly have also killed Americans.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long list of Iranian actions in its low-level war with the U.S., and unfortunately, the list is likely to get longer.  But it would be surprising if Iranian leaders Ã¢â‚¬â€œ despite all their threats following the killing of Soleimani Ã¢â‚¬â€œ decided to go further and risk a full-fledged war with the U.S. that would devastate their country and might end with the overthrow of their regime. The danger comes more from miscalculation than madness.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BRIAN MICHAEL JENKINS",en,terrorattack,,

The strike on the base known as Camp Simba in Manda Bay is the latest by the group in Kenya since Nairobi sent troops across the border in 2011.  Kenya's army spokesman Colonel Paul Njuguna said in a statement that at 5:30 am, ""an attempt was made to breach security at Manda Air Strip.""  ""The attempted breach was successfully repulsed. Four terrorists bodies have so far been found. The airstrip is safe. Arising from the unsuccessful breach a fire broke out affecting some of the fuel tanks located at the airstrip.""  He said the fire had been brought under control ""and standard security procedures are now on-going.""  Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia also confirmed there had been an attack and said the militants ""have been repulsed.""  ""We are not sure if there are still remnants within,"" he said.  Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying it had ""successfully stormed the heavily fortified military base and have now taken effective control of part of the base.""  The group said there had been both Kenyan and American casualties, however this could not be immediately verified.  Al-Shabaab said the attack was part of its ""Al-Quds (Jerusalem) shall never be Judaized"" campaign Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a term it first used during an attack on the upscale Dusit hotel complex in Nairobi in January last year that left 21 people dead.  The Somali jihadists have staged several large-scale attacks inside Kenya, in retaliation for Nairobi sending troops into Somalia as well as to target foreign interests.  Despite years of costly efforts to fight Al-Shabaab, the group on December 28 managed to detonate a vehicle packed with explosives in Mogadishu, killing 81 people.  The spate of attacks highlights the group's resilience and capacity to inflict mass casualties at home and in the region, despite losing control of major urban areas in Somalia.  The Lamu region, close to the Somali border, has been plagued by attacks from Al-Shabaab, with frequent strikes along the frontier notably targeting security forces with roadside bombs.  In their November report, a UN panel of experts on Somalia noted an ""unprecedented number"" of homemade bombs and other attacks across the Kenya-Somalia border in June and July last year.  On Thursday, at least 3 people were killed when suspected Shabaab gunmen ambushed a bus travelling in the area.  According to the Institute for Security Studies, the United States has 34 known military bases in Africa, from where it conducts ""drone operations, training, military exercises, direct action and humanitarian activities.""  US military strikes in Somalia surged after President Donald Trump declared the south of the country an ""area of active hostilities.""  In an April statement, US military command for Africa, AFRICOM, said it had killed more than 800 people in 110 strikes in Somalia since April 2017. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,terrorattack,,

The attack destroyed U.S. aircraft and vehicles, Kenyan authorities said, and at least four attackers were killed.  It was not yet clear whether any U.S. or Kenyan forces were killed. A U.S. Africa Command statement said ""an accountability of personnel assessment is underway."" The midday statement said the Manda Bay airfield was ""still in the process of being fully secured.""  The Al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab, based in nearby Somalia, claimed responsibility and asserted that ""intense"" combat with U.S. forces continued. The U.S. statement called the al-Shabab claims exaggerated and said U.S. and Kenyan forces repelled the attack.  4 KILLED IN KENYAN BUS ATTACK CLAIMED BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS  It is the first known al-Shabab attack against U.S. forces inside Kenya, a key base for fighting one of the world's most resilient extremist organizations.  A plume of black smoke rose above the base. Residents said a car bomb had exploded. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia told The Associated Press that five suspects were arrested and were being interrogated.  An internal Kenyan police report seen by the AP said two fixed-wing aircraft, a U.S. Cessna and a Kenyan one, were destroyed along with two U.S. helicopters and multiple U.S. vehicles at the Manda Bay military airstrip. The report said explosions were heard at around 5:30 a.m. from the direction of the airstrip. The scene, now secured, indicated that al-Shabab likely entered ""to conduct targeted attacks,"" the report said.  The U.S. military said only that ""initial reports reflect damage to infrastructure and equipment."" The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority said the airstrip was closed for all operations.  Al-Shabab's statement included photos of blazing aircraft it asserted were from the attack. A second al-Shabab claim issued hours later asserted that ""intense close-quarters combat"" against U.S. forces continued.  The military's Camp Simba in Lamu county, established more than a decade ago, has under 100 U.S. personnel, according to Pentagon figures. U.S. forces at the Manda Bay airfield train and give counter-terror support to East African partners, according to the military. A U.S. flag-raising at the camp in August signaled its change ""from tactical to enduring operations,"" the Air Force said at the time.  According to another internal Kenyan police report seen by the AP, dated Friday, a villager that day said he had spotted 11 suspected al-Shabab members entering Lamu's Boni forest, which the extremists have used as a hideout. The report said Kenyan authorities did not find them.  Al-Shabab has launched a number of attacks inside Kenya, including against civilian targets such as buses, schools and shopping malls. The group has been the target of a growing number of U.S. airstrikes inside Somalia during President Donald Trump's administration.  The latest attack comes just over a week after an al-Shabab truck bomb in Somalia's capital killed at least 79 people and U.S. airstrikes killed seven al-Shabab fighters in response.  Last year al-Shabab attacked a U.S. military base inside Somalia that is used to launch drone strikes. The extremist group also has carried out multiple attacks against Kenyan troops in the past in retaliation for Kenya sending troops to Somalia to fight it.  This attack marks a significant escalation of al-Shabab's campaign of attacks inside Kenya, said analyst Andrew Franklin, a former U.S. Marine and longtime Kenya resident.  ""Launching a deliberate assault of this type against a well-defended permanent base occupied by (Kenya Defence Forces), contractors and U.S. military personnel required a great deal of planning, rehearsals, logistics and operational capability,"" he said. Previous attacks against security forces have mainly been ambushes on Kenyan army or police patrols.  The early Sunday attack comes days after a U.S. airstrike killed Iran's top military commander and Iran vowed retaliation, but al-Shabab is a Sunni Muslim group and there is no sign of links to Shiite Iran or proxies.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Analyst Rashid Abdi in Twitter posts discussing the attack said it had nothing to do with the tensions in the Middle East but added that Kenyan security services have long been worried that Iran was trying to cultivate ties with al-Shabab.  ""Avowedly Wahhabist Al-Shabaab not natural ally of Shia Iran, hostile, even. But if Kenyan claims true, AS attack may have been well-timed to signal to Iran it is open for tactical alliances,"" he wrote, adding that ""an AS that forges relations with Iran is nightmare scenario.""  When asked whether the U.S. military was looking into any Iranian link to the attack, U.S. Africa Command spokesman Col. Christopher Karns said only that ""al-Shabab, affiliated with al-Qaida, has their own agenda and have made clear their desire to attack U.S. interests.""  The al-Shabab claim of responsibility said Sunday's attack was part of its ""Jerusalem will never be Judaized"" campaign, a rarely made reference that also was used after al-Shabab's deadly attack on a luxury mall complex in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, in January 2019.",en,terrorattack,881,"['US', 'Kenya']"

Asked about reports indicating that intelligence behind the strike was thin, Pompeo told ABCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“This WeekÃ¢â‚¬Â that there was Ã¢â‚¬Å“no scepticismÃ¢â‚¬Â among senior leaders who had access to all of the intelligence.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The intelligence assessment made clear that no action Ã¢â‚¬â€œ allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting and his planning, his terror campaign Ã¢â‚¬â€œ created more risk than taking the action that we took last week,Ã¢â‚¬Â Pompeo said in the interview.  Soleimani, IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pre-eminent military commander, was killed on Friday in a US drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport, an attack that took long-running hostilities between Washington and Tehran into uncharted territory and raised the spectre of wider conflict in the Middle East.

Though it generally focuses on human rights violations, the ICC charged the leader of the jihadist group, Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, with a war crime for destroying cultural artifacts in Timbuktu.  The case was the first criminal charge of its kind. It ""breaks new ground for the protection of humanity's shared cultural heritage and values,"" UNESCO Secretary-General Irina Bokova said at the time. Al-Mahdi eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years in prison  That case has renewed relevance amid the standoff between the United States and Iran days after the United States killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in a targeted drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq, on Friday.  In a tweet Saturday night , Trump said that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets, the United States has targeted 52 Iranian sites -- a reference to the number of Americans taken hostage in the 1979 revolution -- ""some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture,"" he wrote.  ""They attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!"" Trump wrote.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" avoided directly answering whether or not the United States was actually targeting cultural sites and defended Trump's tweeted threat.  ""We will be bold in protecting American interests and we'll do so in a way that is consistent with the rule of law. We've always done that, Jake, and President Trump's tweet doesn't deviate from that one iota,"" he said.  ""So cultural centers are theoretically fair targets, in your view?"" Tapper asked.  ""We're going to do the things that are right and the things that are consistent with American law,"" Pompeo said.  Destroying cultural sites as war crime  Protesters shout slogans against the United States and Israel as they hold posters with the image of Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a US airstrike in Iraq, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during a demonstration in the Kashmiri town of Magam on January 3.  However, an attack on a cultural site would violate several international treaties and would likely be considered a war crime.  In 2017, for example, a United Nations Security Council resolution ""condemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artifacts."" That resolution came as a response to the Islamic State's destruction of a number of major historic and cultural sites in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and 2015.  The UN was clear then that actions targeting cultural locations constituted a war crime.  ""The deliberate destruction of our common cultural heritage constitutes a war crime and represents an attack on humanity as a whole,"" said the spokesman for then-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2015.  Nicholas Burns, former undersecretary of state for political affairs and ambassador to NATO, noted the Trump administration supported the 2017 UN resolution condemning destruction of cultural sites.  ""His threat is immoral and Un-American,"" Burns wrote on Twitter.  JUST WATCHED Khamenei's adviser: Iran response to US will be military Replay More Videos ...

If the United States does carry out Trump's threat to strike any of Iran's cultural sites, then ""for sure no American military staff, no American political center, no American military base, no American vessel will be safe,"" Dehghan said. ""If he says 52, we say 300, and they are accessible to us.""  In a tweet, Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said an attack on a cultural site is a war crime.  ""Having committed grave breaches of (international) law in Friday's cowardly assassinations, (Trump) threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS,"" he said, referring to the phrase for international law norms. ""Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME""  ""Those masquerading as diplomats and those who shamelessly sat to identify Iranian cultural & civilian targets should not even bother to open a law dictionary,"" he continued . ""Jus cogens refers to peremptory norms of international law, i.e. international red lines. That is, a big(ly) 'no no.'""  US officials say widespread opposition to targeting cultural sites  Two senior US officials on Sunday described to CNN's Jim Sciutto widespread opposition within the Trump administration to targeting cultural sites in Iran.  ""Nothing rallies people like the deliberate destruction of beloved cultural sites. Whether ISIS's destruction of religious monuments or the burning of the Leuven Library in WWI, history shows targeting locations giving civilization meaning is not only immoral but self-defeating,"" one of the officials told CNN.  Another official who formerly worked in both the Trump and Obama administrations told CNN: ""As a matter of principle, we as a nation and as a military do not attack the culture sites of any adversary.""  Additionally, several sources told CNN there are no indications -- aside, perhaps, from Trump's tweet -- that the United States would actually strike cultural sites in Iran.  Colin Kahl, former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama and national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, expressed skepticism that there are actually cultural sites on the list of possible retaliatory sites.  ""For what it's worth, I find it hard to believe the Pentagon would provide Trump targeting options that include Iranian cultural sites,"" he tweeted .

Sirte has been controlled by forces aligned with Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) since Islamic State (IS) militants were expelled in 2016.  The rebel forces, loyal to Gen Khalifa Haftar, have been waging an offensive targeting the capital Tripoli.  The GNA has not yet commented.  A resident of the northern city of Sirte, located on the Mediterranean coast, told Reuters news agency they could see convoys of troops belonging to Gen Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA).  ""They control large parts of the city now. We also hear gunfire,"" the unnamed resident added.  The reports came after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that his country's troops had begun moving into Libya to support the GNA in Tripoli.  The UN-backed government is supported by Turkey and its ally Qatar, while Gen Haftar is backed by Egypt and the UAE.  What is happening in Sirte?  The LNA said it had taken control of Sirte following a rapid advance on the city preceded by air strikes.  ""Sirte has been totally liberated... from terrorist groups,"" Ahmad al-Mesmari, spokesman for Gen Haftar's forces, said on television.  It came after a series of posts on Facebook in which the group said it had taken control of key positions, including the local airport, and was making steady progress ""towards the heart of Sirte to cleanse it from the grip of armed militias"".  The GNA has not responded publicly to the reports of the takeover.  Sirte is located roughly midway between Libyan rival armed forces and authorities based in the east and west of the country. It is also near the resource-rich Oil Crescent region.  What's the background?  Libya has been torn by violence since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011 by Nato-backed forces.  The country has two rival administrations, the UN-backed one based in Tripoli, and Gen Haftar's one in the eastern city of Tobruk.  The LNA launched its military offensive against the capital Tripoli last April. The group has intensified its efforts to gain ground in recent weeks as Turkey prepared to ramp up military support for the GNA.

If there is retaliation Soleimani's long-term deputy, Esmail Qaani, will be the one leading it.  Following the assassination Mr Qaani became the new chief of Iran's elite Quds force.  Quds is the overseas arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), set up in the wake of the Iranian revolution in 1979 to defend the country's Islamic system.  Mr Qaani, 63, was born in the north-eastern city of Mashad, Iran's second most populous city and an important pilgrimage site for Shia Muslims. He joined the IRGC in 1980.  Like Soleimani, Mr Qaani is a veteran of the bloody 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, which pitted the forces of the new Iranian government against those of then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  Mr Qaani has said the friendship the pair forged came through the hardships of the conflict. ""We are children of war,"" Iranian media quoted him as saying.  After the war he joined the Quds force and was stationed in Khorasan Province, which borders Afghanistan and Turkmenistan.  Little is known about his activities but it is thought that while Soleimani focused on the west, Mr Qaani looked after Iranian priorities in the east, such as combating drug smuggling and aiding Afghanistan's Northern Alliance in its battles against the Taliban  Mr Qaani is also said to have performed more of a day-to-day, administrative role in the forces.  In a mark of his seniority in the organisation, Mr Qaani was sanctioned by the US in 2012 for his work funding the Quds operations around the world.  Soleimani worked to bolster the Iranian state's influence in the Middle East, playing an active role in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

He quickly echoed promises of action from Iran's leadership over Soleimani's death.  ""God the Almighty has promised to take martyr Soleimani's revenge. Certainly actions will be taken,"" he told state television.  Announcing Mr Qaani as Soleimani's successor, Ayatollah Khamenei said Quds would be ""unchanged"".  While there are questions whether the new Quds chief can match Soleimani's influence, analysts say the strength of the IRGC owes more than just to individuals.

He said the IRGC ""relies much less on individuals than many analysts believe"", adding: ""Soleimani's death will have an impact, but there will be no discernible change to Iran's regional network or operations.

""The act by the United States ... it enraged the feelings of many people outside Iran, inside Iran - that will have consequences for the United States,"" Zarif said.

Tuesday's funeral comes after days of processions that attracted huge crowds in the streets of Ahvaz in southwestern Iran, followed by Mashhad in the northwest, the capital Tehran and the holy city of Qom.  'What are they afraid of?'  In response to the assassination of Soleimani, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned earlier this week that ""a harsh retaliation is waiting"".  Washington argues it killed the commander in self-defence, aiming to disrupt plans to attack US personnel and interests. US President Donald Trump has defended the killing of Soleimani and threatened more retaliatory actions if Iran targets US citizens or assets.  Zarif meanwhile was scheduled to attend the United Nations' meetings later this week, but said his visa request was blocked by Washington.  ""Secretary Pompeo called secretary-general of the United Nations yesterday, and said they didn't have time to consider my request and therefore they will not issue a visa,"" Zarif said, adding that the decision was in violation of US commitments.  ""What are they afraid of? What do they think would happen if I go to New York,"" Zarif said.  ""They think that I cannot communicate with the American people without coming to the United States. I can communicate with the American people sitting at home"".  Although it is unclear how or when Iran may respond to the US assassination of Soleimani, any response is likely to come once the mourning period ends.  In a speech broadcast live on television earlier on Tuesday, Zarif said the US president committed a ""stupid mistake by assassinating the greatest commander who stood in the face of terrorism"".  ""Our region, because of the US intervention ... has become victim to the endless war,"" Zarif said.  ""Removing the US from western Asia is what will ... end wars and death in this region.""",en,terrorattack,881,['US']

On Monday, the forces of Libya's renegade general Khalifa Haftar said they have entered the city and took control of large parts.  Khaled al-Mahjoub, a spokesman of Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), said the fighters captured ""all the districts surrounding the city"", including al-Qardabiya airbase, before moving towards the city centre.  More:  However, on Monday, the GNA dismissed Haftar's claims as ""rumours claiming gains of militias and mercenaries"" supporting the LNA leader.  But on Tuesday, the Sirte Protection Force, a GNA ally, said it had retreated from the city.  ""After studying the situation, our forces took a decision to withdraw outside Sirte, then await orders,"" the Sirte Protection Force said in a statement.  ""Our forces still retain their full capabilities and our withdrawal from Sirte is not the end,"" it added.  A Sirte Protection Force spokesman said the group had withdrawn ""to save the blood of civilians and the youth of the forces"" in Sirte, adding that the LNA got help from ""sleeper cells"" in the city of 120,000.  The spokesman also accused LNA fighters of burning homes and looting in Sirte after entering the city on Monday.  Forces loyal to Haftar denied any violations.  ""These are neither our actions or the Libyan army's actions. On the contrary, we were received with cheers,"" an LNA spokesman told Reuters news agency.  Holding Sirte would be an important gain for eastern-based Haftar, who, since April, has waged a military offensive on the capital, Tripoli, home to the GNA, to try to extend his control across the vast, mainly desert country.  Sirte is just west of important oil export terminals, also controlled by Haftar, and is strategically positioned on supply routes between eastern, western and southern Libya.  Sirte lies in the centre of Libya's Mediterranean coast, and has been controlled by GNA-aligned forces since they ejected the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) from the city with the help of US air raids in late 2016.  On Tuesday, an LNA source said its forces clashed with Misratan forces in Abu Grain area, between Sirte and Misrata.  Since launching a bitter campaign for Benghazi, Libya's second city, in 2014, Haftar has gradually expanded his territorial control across the North African country.  Last April, Haftar launched a military campaign to capture Tripoli from the GNA, but has so far failed to progress beyond the city's outskirts.  200107072132077  His LNA forces have received material and military support from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt, according to United Nations experts and diplomats.  The LNA's advance comes as Turkey has started sending military advisers and experts to Libya to help shore up the GNA, part of rising international involvement in Libya's conflict.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that ""there will be an operation centre [in Libya], there will be a Turkish lieutenant general leading and they will be managing the situation over there. [Turkish soldiers] are gradually moving there right now"".  In response to Turkey's move, the European Union's top policy chief said the bloc must work towards achieving a ceasefire in Libya and called on Turkey not to send military experts and technical teams to the North African country.  ""We asked for a ceasefire and we asked also to stop escalation and to end external interference, which has been increasing in the last days,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters following a meeting with British, Italian, German and French foreign ministers.  According to UN data, more than 1,000 people have been killed since the start of the operation and more than 5,000 injured.",en,terrorattack,889,['Libya']

General Qassem SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s burial went ahead in the early evening in the southeastern city of Kerman, four days after his killing in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq that plunged the region into a new crisis and raised fears of a wider Middle East war.  Soleimani, who commanded the elite Quds Force, was responsible for building up TehranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network of proxy armies across the Middle East. He was a pivotal figure in orchestrating IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-standing campaign to drive U.S. forces out of Iraq.  A senior Iranian official said Tehran was considering several scenarios to avenge his death. Other senior figures have said the Islamic Republic would match the scale of the killing when it responds, but that it would choose the time and place.  U.S. officials have said Soleimani was killed because of solid intelligence indicating forces under his command planned further attacks on U.S. targets in the region, though they have provided no evidence.  U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CNN on Tuesday: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are not looking to start a war with Iran but we are prepared to finish one. What weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to see is the situation de-escalated.Ã¢â‚¬Â  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday Washington had singled out 52 Iranian sites, including ones that are very important to Iranian culture, as targets if Iran attacks Americans or U.S. assets in response to SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.  On Tuesday, however, Trump told reporters he would obey international law against attacking cultural sites in military conflicts.  Soleimani was a national hero to many Iranians, whether supporters of the clerical leadership or not, but viewed as a dangerous villain by Western governments opposed to IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arc of influence running across the Levant and into the Gulf region.  IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opponents say its proxies have fuelled conflicts, killing and displacing people in Iraq, Syria and beyond. Tehran says any operations abroad are at the request of governments and that it offers Ã¢â‚¬Å“advisory supportÃ¢â‚¬Â.  U.S. LETTER  TuesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stampede broke out amid the crush of mourners, killing 56 people, state television said. More than 210 people were injured, an emergency services official told the semi-official Fars news agency.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Today because of the heavy congestion of the crowd unfortunately a number of our fellow citizens who were mourning were injured and a number were killed,Ã¢â‚¬Â emergency medical services chief Pirhossein Kolivand told state television.  SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body had been taken to holy ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite Muslim cities in Iraq and Iran, as well as the Iranian capital Tehran, before arriving in Kerman for burial in the cemeteryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“martyrs sectionÃ¢â‚¬Â, according to the semi-official news agency ISNA.  In each place, huge numbers of people filled thoroughfares, chanting Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬Â and weeping with emotion. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wept as he led prayers in Tehran.  Prompted by a strong public backlash over the killing of Soleimani on Iraqi soil, lawmakers in Iraq voted on Sunday to demand a removal of all foreign forces from the country.  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said the Iraqi military joint operations command had received a letter from the U.S. army concerning a possible U.S. withdrawal. But he said the letterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s English and Arabic language versions were not identical and so Iraq had requested clarifications.  U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had said on Monday that a leaked letter from the U.S. military to Iraq that created impressions of an imminent U.S. withdrawal was a poorly worded draft meant only to underscore an increased movement of forces in the region.

Mehdi Bolourian/Fars News Agency/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS  Abdul Mahdi has told the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad that the parliamentary resolution must be implemented.  U.S. Defense Secretary Esper, however, told a Pentagon news conference on Tuesday that he had not received a request from Iraq to withdraw U.S. troops from the country and noted that the resolution was non-binding.  About 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, where there has been a U.S. military presence since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in a U.S.-led 2003 invasion, with Washington and Tehran vying for the upper hand in the country.  Foreign forces have been in Iraq mainly as part of a U.S.-led coalition that has trained and backed up Iraqi security forces against the threat of Islamic State militants.  Trump also said on Tuesday that if U.S. forces departed Iraq it would leave Iran with a much bigger footprint in the country, although he would like to withdraw U.S. troops at some point since Washington wanted Baghdad to provide for its own security.  Ã¢â‚¬ËœDEFINITIVE REVENGEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will take revenge, a hard and definitive revenge,Ã¢â‚¬Â the head of IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Revolutionary Guards, General Hossein Salami, told the throngs in Kerman before the stampede.  Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said 13 Ã¢â‚¬Å“revenge scenariosÃ¢â‚¬Â were being considered, Fars news agency reported. Even the weakest option would prove Ã¢â‚¬Å“a historic nightmare for the AmericansÃ¢â‚¬Â, he said.  French President Emmanuel Macron, in a phone call to his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday, urged Tehran to avoid any actions that could worsen regional tensions.  Iran, whose coastline runs along a Gulf oil shipping route that includes the narrow Strait of Hormuz, has allied forces across the Middle East through which it can act. Representatives from those groups, including the Palestinian Islamist Hamas and LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hezbollah movement, attended funeral events in Tehran.  Slideshow (6 Images)  Despite its strident rhetoric, analysts say Iran will want to avoid any conventional military conflict with superior U.S. forces.  Friction between Iran and the United States has risen since Trump withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, approved by his predecessor Barack Obama, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran slashing its vital oil exports.

3678355,cnn,Joshua Berlinger Artemis Moshtaghian Jack Guy,"Ukrainian plane crashes in Iran after takeoff, killing 176 on board",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_meast/~3/1dz6tJZh564/index.html,,9/1/2020 11:51,"(CNN) Investigators were scrambling Wednesday to determine the cause of a crash that killed all 176 people on a Ukrainian plane, shortly after it took off from Tehran's international airport.  Iranian state media earlier blamed technical issues on the crash and Ukraine ruled out rocket attacks, but officials in both countries have since walked back their statements and are now refusing to speculate on the cause. Questions are swirling over the timing of the incident, which came just hours after Iran fired a number of missiles at two Iraqi bases housing US troops.  Eighty-two Iranians, 63 Canadians, and 11 Ukrainians died onboard flight PS752, according to a tweet from Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko. There were also 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three British nationals among the victims, he said.  The Boeing 737 jet operated by Ukraine International Airlines took off early Wednesday en route to the Ukrainian capital Kiev, carrying 167 passengers and nine crew before crashing between the cities of Parand and Shahriar. Witnesses described seeing a fireball in the sky and images of the wreckage show charred parts of the plane strewn over a field.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 138 of the passengers were supposed to catch a connecting flight to Canada. That flight landed in Toronto Wednesday afternoon with many seats empty.  The captain of the crashed plane has been identified as Volodymyr Gaponenko, an experienced pilot with 11,600 hours flying on Boeing 737 aircraft under his belt. The instructor pilot was Oleksiy Naumkin, also experienced with 12,000 hours on the aircraft. Ukraine International Airlines president, Yevhenii Dykhne, said, ""It is impossible that there were mistakes by the crew.""  At a press conference in Kiev, he said Tehran airport was ""not a simple airport"" and the pilots required several years of training to use it.  Iran refuses to work with US  The fatal crash comes as hostilities between Tehran and Washington soar. Iran fired rockets at the Iraqi bases in retaliation for a US drone strike that killed Iran's top commander, Qasem Soleimani, on Iraqi soil last week.  It is not known if these events have any link at all to the plane crash but political tensions appear to be surfacing in the investigation.  Searchers have found the plane's black boxes -- a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, which could offer crucial evidence about what happened to the plane leading up to the crash, the Tehran prosecutor told Iranian state media. But Iranian officials do not plan to share information garnered from them with the plane's manufacturer, US company Boeing, as is usual in crash investigations.  Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran's Civil Aviation Authority, told Iran's semiofficial Mehr news agency that the US would not be involved at any stage of the investigation.  ""We will not give the black box to the manufacturer or America,"" he said.  Iranian authorities are working through the debris at the crash site south-west of Tehran.  Under international rules, Iran is responsible for the investigation, but Ukraine should participate in the probe as the state of registry and state of operator, as should the US as the state of design and manufacture of the Boeing aircraft.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Facebook post that he would cancel the rest of his current trip to Oman and would return to Kiev due to the crash.  Zelensky said his government was sending a team of experts and security officials to Iran, on Wednesday evening. ""Our priority is to establish the truth and those responsible for this terrible catastrophe,"" he wrote in a statement on Facebook.  The cause of the crash is not yet known.  What happened?  It is too early in the investigation to know what might have gone wrong, but flight data openly available online provides some clues.  The plane is a Boeing 737-800, a predecessor to the company's 737 Max, which was grounded after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.  The Boeing 737-800 in Tehran climbed to an altitude of nearly 8,000 feet before the aircraft's data suddenly disappeared, according to flight-tracking service FlightRadar 24, which said in a tweet that the jet had been in service for about three and a half years. FlightRadar 24 data suggests that the crash happened within three minutes after takeoff.  According to former FAA chief of staff Michael Goldfarb, the lost data is ""very unusual"" and could suggest a ""catastrophic"" incident.  ""When the data is lost at 8,000 feet suddenly that implies something catastrophic happened to that airplane and they could no longer communicate with the ground control,"" Goldfarb told CNN.  Goldfarb said an ""uncontained"" engine failure -- which would create the type of large fire ball reported by witnesses -- could be to blame, but it was too early to tell. An uncontained engine failure, in which pieces of the engine break apart, releases shrapnel that can destroy the plane.  Alan Diehl, a former accident investigator for the US National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Aviation Administration and Air Force, said that that engine failure would be one of the main focuses of any investigation, considering the aircraft lost contact minutes after takeoff. ""That's the second-most dangerous phase of flight,"" he told CNN.  He said investigators always looks at four main causes in a crash -- mechanical, human, environment and lastly hostile actions.  ""All of those are certainly on the table,"" he said.  The plane was a Boeing 737-800 that had been in service for about three-and-a-half years.  A Boeing spokesperson told CNN they are ""aware of the media reports out of Iran and we are gathering more information.""  The crash takes place just days before the company's new CEO David Calhoun will formally take the job. Calhoun replaces Dennis Muilenburg, who was ousted in December after Boeing's disastrous year.  The American aviation giant is still reeling from the aftermath of the two 737 Max crashes, and has struggled with delays and other issues in its bid to get the planes back in the air.",en,terrorattack,881,['Iran']

GEELONG, Victoria: The Iranian leadership has doubled down on its anti-US rhetoric and promises of retribution. Qasem Soleimani was too important to the regime to let this slide.  As the commander of the Quds Force in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Soleimani was in direct contact with Hezbollah in Lebanon.  Advertisement  Advertisement  He mobilised the militant group to defend Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad against US-backed rebels and armed Islamist groups. Soleimani also visited Moscow in 2016 to make a case for, and coordinate, RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military involvement in Syria.  Soleimani made frequent trips to Iraq to bolster the Kurdish and later the Shia militia push-backs against the Islamic State.  The recapture of Mosul from the Islamic State in 2016 by the US-backed Iraqi army and the Shia Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) was greeted in Iran with joy.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visits the family of the Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by an air strike in Baghdad, in Tehran, Iran Jan 4, 2020. (Photo: Official President Website/Handout via REUTERS)  Advertisement  Advertisement  Soleimani was celebrated as a national hero. The Iranian regime praised him for serving the national security doctrine of offensive defence: Defeating the Islamic State (IS) beyond IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s borders.  DIRECT MILITARY CONFRONTATION IS UNLIKELY  It makes sense, then, that the Iranian regime feels compelled to respond to SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assassination.  Iran cannot afford to let its national hero be slain without retribution. When SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter asked President Hassan Rouhani, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who will avenge my fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood?Ã¢â‚¬Â, his response was swift: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will all take revengeÃ¢â‚¬Â.  But what can Iran do? The Iranian leadership has been woefully aware of its limitations in case of any direct confrontation with the United States.  IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armed forces, including the zealot IRGC, are no match for US firepower. Direct military confrontation will amount to suicide, and the Iranian leadership is in no hurry to act crazy, no matter how deeply hurt it may feel.  This fits the pattern of the cat-and-mouse game the IRGC has been playing with the US navy in the Persian Gulf to disrupt oil shipments without raising the stakes too high.  Iran threatened on many occasions to block the Strait of Hormuz and seriously hurt the global economy, but never carried through as it could have prompted a military retaliation from the US.  The assassination Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, which was ordered by US President Donald Trump, ratcheted up tensions between the arch-enemies. (Photo: AFP/HOSSEIN MERSADIP)  Iran, likewise, had a calibrated response to the re-imposition of crippling US sanctions following TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal: a combination of harsh rhetoric and mild action. Tehran sought to look tough but not too threatening to invite a US reprisal.  But the targeted killing of a celebrated Iranian commander is a game changer, meaning the Iranian response will likely be stronger.    Given the perils of direct confrontation for the Iranian regime, the most likely recourse may be a mobilisation of IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proxy affiliations to exact revenge on the United States, most likely in Iraq.  In fact, Iran does not really need to instruct Shia militia in Iraq to hurt the United States. The Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) also lost its second-in-command (Abu Mahdi al Muhandis) in the same drone attack that killed Soleimani.  Rocket attacks in recent days on the Green Zone in Baghdad are likely to be just the prelude to a major PMU action against US assets in Iraq.  The turning tide against the US military presence, evident in the Iraqi parliamentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resolution to expel foreign forces, could embolden PMU to step up its operations even further.  This would be disastrous for the war-ravaged country, and there is no guarantee that Iran would not be embroiled in the conflict.  RESUME NUCLEAR PROGRAMME?  Beyond the military options, Iran also has two immediate diplomatic options. The first is to completely revoke the nuclear deal and resume its nuclear programme.  With the US withdrawal from the deal in 2018 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the Trump administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subsequent imposition of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum pressureÃ¢â‚¬Â strategy on Tehran Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Iran already has no incentive to observe its commitments.  And Iran was edging away from the deal even before the latest escalation of tensions.  After SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assassination, Rouhani said Iran will recommence uranium enrichment and stockpiles, measures that the nuclear deal was designed to seriously limit and monitor.  The Iranian leadership claims it is still in compliance with the general rules set by the International Atomic Energy Agency to govern nuclear activity for civilian use. This move is designed to drive a wedge between the United States and its European allies.  By addressing European leaders directly, Rouhani reiterated that Iran would be prepared to return to the deal, but only if Europe, Russia and China could offer a way around US sanctions. This scenario looks extremely unlikely.

(AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP)  GOING THROUGH THE UN MAY BE A LENGTHY AND INEFFECTIVE PROCESS  Second, Iran could take its case to the United Nations and seek justice through international law.  In the wake of the Soleimani killing, the Iranian ambassador to the UN lambasted the United States for Ã¢â‚¬Å“an illegitimate actionÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“an act of aggressionÃ¢â‚¬Â.  This move could resonate with the majority opinion in the United Nations, as well as many US lawmakers and international law experts, who have questioned TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s justification for assassinating Soleimani to prevent an imminent threat against the United States.    But going through the UN would be a lengthy and ineffective process as the United States has made a habit of dismissing or ignoring UN resolutions it does not like.  In addition, it is difficult to imagine that any non-military option would be enough to satisfy IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impulse for revenge.

This is a 25 per cent increase over the 86 clusters reported on Monday.  Dengue infections have been rising over the past two weeks, following five weeks of declining figures.  There were 313 reported dengue infections last week. Between Sunday and 3pm on Wednesday, another 189 people were diagnosed with the viral disease.  The current outbreak appears to be quite severe, with 20 people dying of it last year.  Eighty-eight people had the more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever last year; this is more than quadruple the previous five-year median of 20 such cases a year.  Generally, one in five people diagnosed by a doctor to have dengue is seriously ill enough to require hospital care.  The infections appear to be spread islandwide, although there is a slightly higher concentration in the north and the east.  The biggest cluster is in Pasir Ris, with 153 cases. Of these, almost a third are in the parallel roads of Riverina View and Riverina Crescent.  Other big clusters include two in the Yio Chu Kang area, one with 134 people infected and the other with 129 cases.  The National Environment Agency is concerned about increased mosquito breeding with the coming Chinese New Year festivities as ""homes and other premises will be decorated with more ornamental plants"".  On its website it urged people to ""take care of these plants and prevent them from becoming mosquito-breeding habitats by making sure water does not gather in the flowerpot plate or on the soil"".

A small amount the size of a 20-cent coin is enough. One female mosquito can lay 300 eggs in its lifetime.  The NEA added: ""Home owners doing spring cleaning are also reminded to properly dispose of any refuse, including large furniture or household items, to avoid the discarded materials from becoming unintentional mosquito-breeding habitats.""  Dengue fever is spread through the bite of a mosquito, which picks up the virus from an infected person and passes it on to other people it then bites.  Symptoms of dengue include fever, joint ache, nausea and vomiting, headache, and rash. In more severe cases, a person may bleed from the nose or gums.",en,diseas,,

The United States, European countries and Saudi Arabia accused Iran of being behind the attack on Saudi Aramco oil plants in Abqaiq and Khurais that was claimed by the Houthis. Iran has denied any involvement.  More:  According to the report seen by Reuters on Wednesday, the independent UN experts to the Security Council Yemen sanctions committee said: ""That despite their claims to the contrary, the Houthi forces did not launch the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September 2019.""  Riyadh, which is backing Yemen's internationally recognised government in its fight against the Houthis, has long accused Iran of supplying the rebels with weapons. Tehran says it supports the rebels diplomatically and politically but has repeatedly denied providing them with any military aid.  The reported findings by the UN monitors come amid escalating tensions in the region after the US assassinated top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq last week and Tehran retaliated on Wednesday by firing missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops.  The UN investigators said they doubted that the drones and land-attack cruise missiles used in the September 14 attack ""have a sufficient range to have been launched from Yemeni territory under the control of the Houthis.""  ""The panel notes that Abqaiq and Khurais were approached respectively from a north/northwestern and north/northeastern direction, rather than from the south, as one would expect in the case of a launch from Yemeni territory,"" the report said, according to Reuters.  The investigators, who monitor sanctions on Yemen, also said they do not believe that ""those comparatively sophisticated weapons were developed and manufactured in Yemen."" They were not tasked with identifying who was responsible for the Saudi attack.  The attacks that targeted the Abqaiq and Khurais oil plants caused an increase in oil prices and shut down more than 5 percent of global oil supply. Saudi Arabia said on October 3 that it had fully restored oil output.  The Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, signalled in September that Riyadh was waiting for results of UN investigations before announcing how his country would respond.  UN experts monitoring UN sanctions on Iran and Yemen travelled to Saudi Arabia days after the September attack.  Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, told the Security Council in a separate report on December 10 that the UN was ""unable to independently corroborate"" that missiles and drones used in the attacks ""are of Iranian origin"".  The report is from the independent panel of experts that reports twice a year to the Security Council on the implementation of sanctions related to the conflict in Yemen that were imposed in 2014 and 2015.  It was submitted to the UN Security Council Yemen sanctions committee on December 27, but will not be made public for a few more weeks.  ""The Houthi forces continue to receive military support in the form of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, anti-tank guided missiles, as well as more sophisticated cruise missile systems,"" the report found.  ""Some of those weapons have technical characteristics similar to arms manufactured in Iran,"" it said.  A Saudi-UAE-led military coalition intervened in Yemen's conflict in 2015 in support of forces loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who had been forced out by the Houthis.  Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions driven to the brink of famine in a war the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",en,terrorattack,,

""Iraq will remain a zone of conflict,"" said Randa Slim of the Washington based Middle East Institute.  Early Wednesday, Iran launched 22 ballistic missiles at bases in Iraq hosting American and other foreign troops, in a calibrated response to the killing of a top Iranian general in a US air strike last week.  Iran warned Iraq about the raids shortly before they happened and in their immediate aftermath, foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran had concluded its ""proportionate"" retaliation.  US President Donald Trump, too, said Iran ""appears to be standing down"" and even suggested Tehran and Washington could work towards a nuclear deal while cooperating against jihadists.  That hinted at a common desire to contain the fallout, but analysts say it would not be enough to spare Iraq. (READ: Trump pulls back from war with Iran)  ""Both sides are so mobilised in Iraq, which has become such symbolic terrain for hitting out at the other,"" said Erica Gaston of the New America Foundation.  Indeed, US troops and even the embassy in Baghdad had been hit by more than a dozen rocket attacks in recent months, which have killed one Iraqi soldier and an American contractor.  The attacks went unclaimed but the US blamed hardline elements of the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi military network incorporated into the state but linked to Tehran.  The strike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani outside Baghdad international airport on Friday also killed his top Iraqi aid and Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.  'Who is the mediator?'  Just because the US and Iran have struck each other directly does not mean the Hashed would now sit on the sidelines, said Gaston.  ""The Hashed is closer to the tip of the spear,"" she said.  ""There isn't perfect command-and-control in the Hashed, which includes a lot of angry militiamen willing to take revenge on the US,"" she added.  Bolstered by Iran's attack, the Hashed said Wednesday it would take its own steps avenge Muhandis's death.  ""That is a promise,"" vowed leading member Qais al-Khazali.  Hours later, two rockets slammed into the Iraqi capital's Green Zone, the high-security enclave where the US embassy, other foreign missions and some foreign troops are based.  Hashed factions decided in recent days to unite under a ""resistance"" coalition to oust US troops from Iraq.  The spectre of bloodshed was especially worrisome as there is no evident mediator between the parties, said Slim.  In Lebanon, Iran's ally Hezbollah has repeatedly clashed with its sworn enemy Israel but the United Nations' peacekeeping force in the south has usually intervened before the conflict could spin out of control.  But ""who is the mutually liked mediator?"" on Iraqi soil, Slim asked.  Baghdad has long warned that tensions between Tehran and Washington, which began deteriorating significantly in 2018, would bring devastating conflict to the entire region.  Iraq's government had tried to strike a balance between the two countries, both of which have close political and military ties to various elements of Iraq's elite.  Balance now 'impossible'  But the stunning developments of the last week Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the killing of Soleimani to Wednesday's pre-dawn strikes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also hugely exacerbated Iraq's political crisis.  ""It has made a balance impossible and pushed Baghdad squarely into Iran's camp,"" said Toby Dodge, a professor at the London School of Economics.  Figures like Iraq's President Barham Saleh, who was seen as one of the most senior officials with close ties to Washington, would likely see their influence dwindle.  ""If last night was the theatre of retaliation, what today brings is political consolidation and domination of the pro-Iran factions,"" Toby said.  The Hashed's political arm, the Fatah bloc, has already seized on anti-US sentiment over the last week to push for a total ouster of foreign troops from Iraqi territory.  Some 5,200 American troops and hundreds more British, French, Canadian and other forces are based in Iraq to help local forces defeat jihadist sleeper cells.  On Wednesday, Iraqis' reactions to Iran's strikes were much tamer than the anger expressed at the US last week.  ""Baghdad condemns the US publicly, but not Iran,"" said Ramzy Mardini, a researcher and Iraq expert.  While appearing to be pro-Washington in the current climate carries a political cost, some political figures may be busy behind the scenes trying to salvage Iraq's relationship with the US and restore some stability, however fragile.  But, Mardini warned, ""if the crisis escalates, Baghdad's space for manoeuvering will shrink. They'll be forced to pick a side Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it won't be the US.""

Trump and Iranian officials looked to defuse a crisis that on Wednesday had threatened to spiral into open conflict after the killing of a prominent Iranian general in Iraq on Jan 3 in a US drone strike was followed by IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retaliatory attack.  The tit-for-tat military action, after months of rising tension since the United States withdrew in 2018 from IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nuclear pact with world powers, had stoked global concerns that the Middle East was heading towards another war.  But both sides drew back from the brink, while Arab and other international leaders called for restraint.  In Iraq, Muslim Shiite groups, opposed to the US presence in Iraq, also sought to cool passions.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it,Ã¢â‚¬Â Trump told the nation after saying Iranian ballistic missiles fired in the early hours of Wednesday caused no casualties and limited damage.  He said Iran Ã¢â‚¬Å“appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concernedÃ¢â‚¬Â but he said the United States would impose additional sanctions on Iran, adding to measures that have slashed its oil exports and crippled its economy.  Trump, who faces re-election this year and who accused predecessors of dragging the United States into unnecessary regional wars, did not say what new sanctions would involve.  His comments came hours after IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign minister said Iranian missile strikes Ã¢â‚¬Å“concludedÃ¢â‚¬Â its response to the killing of Qassem Soleimani, a powerful general who masterminded IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drive to build up proxy armies abroad.  The minister, Javad Zarif, said on Twitter that Iran did not Ã¢â‚¬Å“seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggressionÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had called IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missile attack a Ã¢â‚¬Å“slap on the faceÃ¢â‚¬Â for the United States and said Iran remained determined to drive US forces out of the region, a policy that analysts say it has pursued via its proxy forces.  But Washington said it had indications Tehran was telling its allies to refrain from new action against US troops.  Calls for patience  US Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News the United States was receiving Ã¢â‚¬Å“encouraging intelligence that Iran is sending messagesÃ¢â‚¬Â to its allied militias not to attack US targets.  Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ite cleric opposed to US and Iranian interference in Iraq, said the Iraq crisis was over and called on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actionsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia the United States blamed for an attack in Iraq in December that killed a US contractor, said Ã¢â‚¬Å“amidst these conditions, passions must be avoided to achieve the desired resultsÃ¢â‚¬Â of expelling US forces.  That contrasted with fiery comments early on Wednesday from Qais al-Khazali, leader of another Iran-backed militia, who said Iraqi forces should respond to the killing of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who died with Soleimani in the Jan 3 US strike.  Arab states, which lie across the Gulf from Iran and feared their region was being dragged into another conflict, also called for cooler heads to prevail in Iraq and beyond.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The brotherly Arab nation of Iraq today is in need of solidarity among its people to avoid war and becoming the site of a battle in which it would lose most,Ã¢â‚¬Â Saudi ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan wrote on Twitter.  In TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s address on Wednesday, he repeated his promise not to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an ambition it denies ever having Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and called for world powers to quit the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that he abandoned.  Trump said world powers should negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran to replace the one set in place under Barack Obama.  Iran has rejected new talks and said negotiations could not be held without an end to sanctions, which have sent IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s currency plunging and slashed vital oil revenues.  There has been no immediate reaction from Iranian officials to TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s address.  The semi-official Fars news agency described the US presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarks as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“big retreat from threatsÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Analysts have said Iran, despite its strident words, has wanted to avoid a conventional war with superior US forces.  US and European government sources said they believed Iran had deliberately sought to avoid US military casualties in its missile strikes to prevent an escalation.  An Iranian army spokesman denied Ã¢â‚¬Å“foreign media reportsÃ¢â‚¬Â suggesting there was some kind of coordination between Iran and the United States before the attack to evacuate bases.

3686019,straitstimes,None,"US House votes to rein in TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war powers amid high US-Iran tensions, United States News & Top Stories",http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-house-passes-measure-to-limit-trumps-ability-to-wage-war-on-iran,10/1/2020 7:19,10/1/2020 12:26,"WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The US House of Representatives voted on Thursday (Jan 9) to stop President Donald Trump from further military action against Iran as the Middle East remained tense after the US killing of a top Iranian commander and IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retaliatory missile strikes.  The Democratic-controlled House voted 224 to 194, almost exclusively along party lines, reflecting the deep divide in Congress. Democrats accused Mr Trump of acting recklessly and backed the war powers resolution, while Mr Trump's fellow Republicans opposed it.  The measure orders the termination of TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war powers to use US armed forces against Iran without CongressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ consent.  The measure now goes to the Senate, which is controlled by TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Republican Party, and faces an uphill battle.  The vote came just hours after Trump said that Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike in Iraq last week last because he had planned to blow up a US embassy.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We caught a total monster and we took him out and that should have happened a long time ago. We did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy,Ã¢â‚¬Â Trump told reporters at the White House.  His remarks seemed to shed more light on what so far have been largely vague descriptions of the intelligence that drove TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conclusion that killing Soleimani and disrupting his plots would be better than any fallout Washington may face.  A White House spokesman called the House-passed war powers measure Ã¢â‚¬Å“ridiculousÃ¢â‚¬Â and politically motivated. The measure ""could undermine the ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to harm,Ã¢â‚¬Â an administration policy statement said.  But if passed by the Senate, the measure does not need TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature to go into effect.  Potentially stepping up international pressure on Teheran, CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US officials said they believed a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed in Iran on Wednesday was brought down by Iranian air defenses by mistake hours after Iran launched its missiles attacks.  Trump said he had suspicions about the cause of the Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 plane crash, adding: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Somebody could have made a mistake.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Iran denied the reports of missiles downing the plane.  NEXT MOVE?  Earlier on Thursday, Iran spurned TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s call for a new nuclear pact, and its commanders threatened more attacks, fuelling worries that an apparent pause in US-Iran conflict could be short-lived.  But each sideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next move was uncertain. Iranian generals resumed their habitual barrage of warnings to Washington, and Trump said new sanctions had been imposed, as his Democratic rivals criticised his handling of the crisis.  Iran fired missiles on Wednesday at bases in Iraq where US troops were stationed in retaliation for SoleimaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killing in a US drone attack of in Baghdad on Jan 3.  Trump said no US troops had been harmed in the strikes and Iran Ã¢â‚¬Å“appears to be standing down,Ã¢â‚¬Â adding that Washington did not want to use its Ã¢â‚¬Å“great military.Ã¢â‚¬Â  The tit-for-tat actions followed months of tension that has increased since Trump pulled the United States out of IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nuclear pact with world powers in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have driven down TeheranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vital oil exports.  Trump said it was time for world powers to replace the 2015 nuclear pact with a new deal so Iran could Ã¢â‚¬Å“thrive and prosper.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬ËœECONOMIC TERRORISMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  Responding to TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s call for a new nuclear deal, IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s UN Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said Teheran could not trust any idea of dialogue when faced with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“economic terrorismÃ¢â‚¬Â of sanctions, Iranian media reported.  IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful Revolutionary Guards also issued new threats to Washington, with one senior commander warning of Ã¢â‚¬Å“harsher revenge soonÃ¢â‚¬Â and another saying WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missile strikes were only the start of a series of attacks across the region.  Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, the new head of the Quds Force, which runs IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign military operations, said he would follow the course pursued by his slain redecessor Soleimani.  Soleimani carved out a sphere of Iranian influence running through Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen, challenging regional rival Saudi Arabia as well as the United States and Israel.  Soleimani was a national hero whose funeral drew vast crowds of mourners. The West saw him as a dangerous and ruthless enemy.  The military comments contrasted with WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarks by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who said Teheran did not want an escalation.  Analysts say that in an election year, Trump wants to avoid getting into a drawn-out conflict.  In turn, Iran will try to avert direct confrontation with superior US forces but can call on proxy militias across the region as US sanctions bite.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not expecting further direct attacks from Iran. We are likely to see more indirect responses through proxies,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ali Alfoneh, senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.  He said there might be a chance for a negotiated solution to the latest standoff as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Trump administration does not appear to actively pursue a war and Iran needs sanctions relief.Ã¢â‚¬Â",en,terrorattack,881,"['US', 'House', 'States', 'States', 'Top', 'Top', 'Top']"

Four soldiers from Iran's Revolutionary Guards rode with him. They parked near a staircase leading to a Cham Wings Airbus A320, destined for Baghdad.  Neither Soleimani nor the soldiers were registered on the passenger manifesto, according to a Cham Wings airline employee who described the scene of their departure from the Syrian capital to Reuters.  More:  Soleimani avoided using his private plane because of rising concerns about his own security, said an Iraqi security source with knowledge of Soleimani's security arrangements.  The passenger flight would be Soleimani's last. Rockets fired from a US drone killed him as he left the Baghdad airport in a convoy of two armoured vehicles.  Also killed was the man who met him at the airport: Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy head of Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), the Iraqi government's umbrella group for the country's militias.  The Iraqi investigation into the attack that killed the two men on January 3 started minutes after the US attack, two Iraqi security officials told Reuters.  National Security agents sealed off the airport and prevented dozens of security staff from leaving, including police, passport officers and intelligence agents.  Investigators have focused on how suspected informants inside the Damascus and Baghdad airports collaborated with the US military to help track and pinpoint Soleimani's position, according to Reuters interviews with two security officials with direct knowledge of Iraq's investigation, two Baghdad airport employees, two police officials and two employees of Syria's Cham Wings Airlines, a private commercial airline which had its headquarters in Damascus.  Probe on suspected leaks  The probe is being led by Falih al-Fayadh, who serves as Iraq's National Security Adviser and the head of the PMF, the body that coordinates with Iraq's mostly Shia militias, many of which are backed by Iran and had close ties to Soleimani.  The National Security agency's investigators have ""strong indications that a network of spies inside Baghdad Airport were involved in leaking sensitive security details"" on Soleimani's arrival to the United States, one of the Iraqi security officials told Reuters.  Mourners attend the burial of Soleimani at his hometown in Kerman on Wednesday [Zoheir Seidanlou//WANA via Reuters]  The suspects include two security staffers at the Baghdad airport and two Cham Wings employees - ""a spy at the Damascus airport and another one working on board the airplane,"" the source said.  The National Security agency's investigators believe the four suspects, who have not been arrested, worked as part of a wider group of people feeding information to the US military, the official said.  The two employees of Cham Wings are under investigation by Syrian intelligence, the two Iraqi security officials said.  The Syrian General Intelligence Directorate did not respond to a request for comment.  'Team of informants'  In Baghdad, National Security agents are investigating the two airport security workers, who are part of the nation's Facility Protection Service, one of the Iraqi security officials said.  ""Initial findings of the Baghdad investigation team suggest that the first tip on Soleimani came from Damascus airport,"" the official said.  ""The job of the Baghdad airport cell was to confirm the arrival of the target and details of his convoy.""  The media office of Iraq's National Security agency did not respond to requests for comment, as did the Iraq mission to the United Nations in New York.  The US Department of Defense declined to comment on whether informants in Iraq and Syria played a role in the attacks.  US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the United States had been closely tracking Soleimani's movements for days prior to the attack but declined to say how the military pinpointed his location the night of the attack.  A Cham Wings manager in Damascus said airline employees were prohibited from commenting on the attack or investigation.  A spokesman for Iraq's Civil Aviation Authority, which operates the nation's airports, declined to comment on the investigation but called it routine after ""such incidents which include high-profile officials.""  Soleimani's last moments  Soleimani's plane landed at the Baghdad airport at about 12:30am on January 3, according to two airport officials, citing footage from its security cameras.  The general and his guards exited the plane on a staircase directly to the tarmac, bypassing customs.  Al-Muhandis met him outside the plane, and the two men stepped into a waiting armoured vehicle. The soldiers guarding the general piled into another armoured four-wheel drive, the airport officials said.

The first two US rockets struck the vehicle carrying Soleimani and al-Muhandis at 12:55am. The four-wheel drive carrying his security was hit seconds later.  As commander of the Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, Soleimani ran clandestine operations in foreign countries and was a key figure in Iran's long-standing campaign to drive US forces out of Iraq.  He spent years running covert operations and cultivating militia leaders in Iraq to extend Iran's influence and fight the interests of the US.  Reuters reported on Saturday that, starting in October, Soleimani had secretly launched stepped-up attacks on US forces stationed in Iraq and equipped Iraqi militias with sophisticated weaponry to carry them out.  Soleimani's killing triggered an outpouring of anger in Iran and call for revenge against the US [File: Ebrahim Noroozi/AP]  The attack on the general sparked widespread outrage and promise of revenge in Iran, which responded on Wednesday with a missile attack on two Iraq military bases that house US troops. No Americans or Iraqis were killed or injured in the attack.  In the hours after the attack, investigators pored over all incoming calls and text messages by the airport night-shift staff in search of who might have tipped off the US to Soleimani's movements, the Iraqi security officials said.  National Security agents conducted hours-long interrogations with employees of airport security and Cham Wings, the sources said. One security worker said agents questioned him for 24 hours before releasing him.  For hours, they grilled him about who he had spoken or texted with before Soleimani's plane landed - including any ""weird requests"" related to the Damascus flight - and confiscated his mobile phone.

A police officer was among the dead, he added.  Provincial home minister Zia Ullah Langu told reporters that investigations by bomb disposal officers indicated that a suicide bomber carried out the attack.  A spokesman for the provincial government, Liaqat Shahwani, confirmed a suicide bomber was to blame.  The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE intelligence group.  A Pakistani military spokesman said on Twitter that paramilitary personnel has reached the mosque and cordoned off the area.  ""A joint search operation with police is in progress, injured being evacuated to hospitals,"" said the spokesman, Asif Ghafoor.

It is rife with Islamist, separatist and sectarian insurgencies and attacks are frequent, even as the number of violent incidents has significantly dropped elsewhere in Pakistan.  Militants still retain the ability to carry out attacks, including on major urban centres and tightly-guarded targets, and analysts have long warned that Pakistan has not yet tackled the root causes of extremism.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“What is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile hit the plane,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's national aviation department, claimed during a press conference Friday.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If they are really sure, they should come and show their findings to the world"" in accordance with international standards, he added, referring to the U.S. and Canada.  UKRAINIAN PLANE SHOT DOWN BY MISTAKE, PENTAGON OFFICIALS BELIEVE  Pentagon officials told Fox News on Thursday that the Ukraine International Airlines flight, which plunged from the sky in a ball of fire shortly after takeoff, was downed by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile.  ""An absolute tragedy,"" one U.S. official told Fox News. ""They just screwed up and it is tragic.""  The U.S. official told Fox News that a Russian-made SA15 missile, which is part of the Tor surface-to-air missile system, was the kind that brought down the aircraft. The crash happened just hours after Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles targeting two military bases housing American and coalition troops.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the downing, also said Friday that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.  IRAN ACCUSES US OF LAUNCHING 'PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATION' FOLLOWING UKRAINE PLANE CRASH  Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian team investigating the crash, said recovering data from the black box flight recorders could take more than a month and that the entire investigation could stretch into next year. He also said Iran may request help from international experts if it is not able to extract the flight recordings.  Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security council, said Friday that he doesn't know if the flight data recorders will be handed over to Boeing, the maker of the plane.  ""I think rather not than yes, but I think all the countries interested in this situation, all those who suffered, will have access to the black boxes,"" he said.  Ukraine currently has 45 investigators in Iran examining the planeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debris. Vadym Prystaiko, the country's foreign minister, said they have been given access to the black boxes and recordings of air-traffic controllers at the Tehran airport. Although investigators have been to the crash site, he said Ã¢â‚¬Å“there are certain pieces that up until this time have not been found or gathered.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Danilov also noted the collection of DNA samples is almost complete, after which countries can repatriate victims' remains.  Videos examined by The Associated Press appear to show the ill-fated airlinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final seconds.  In one video, a fast-moving light can be seen through the trees as someone films from the ground. The light appears to be the burning plane, which plummets to the earth as a huge fireball illuminates the landscape.  Someone off-camera says in Farsi: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The plane has caught fire. ...

Call the fire department!Ã¢â‚¬Â  HOUSE DEMOCRAT CALLS UKRAINE PLANE CRASH 'COLLATERAL DAMAGE' FROM TRUMP'S ACTIONS  Iran's state-run IRNA news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying Friday that Iran ""has invited both Ukraine and the Boeing company to participate in the investigations.Ã¢â‚¬Â He later said a 10-member Canadian delegation was heading to Iran to assist victims' families.  Iran had initially said it would not allow Boeing to take part in the probe, going against prevailing international norms on crash investigations. It later invited the U.S. accident-investigating agency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the National Transportation Safety Board -- to take part in the investigation.  The NTSB said late Thursday that it would Ã¢â‚¬Å“evaluate its level of participation,"" but its role could be limited by U.S. sanctions on Iran. U.S. officials have also expressed concern about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Under rules set by a United Nations aviation organization, the NTSB is entitled to participate because the crash involved a Boeing 737-800 jet that was designed and built in the U.S.  A preliminary Iranian investigative report released Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the burning plane was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down.

The officials said a military air attack targeted Abdul Reza Shahlai, a high-ranking commander in Iran's Islamic Republican Guard Corps but the mission was not successful. The officials spoke to the Associated Post on condition of anonymity in order to discuss a classified mission.  The Pentagon declined to discuss the highly classified operation.  More:  ""We have seen the report of a January 2 air strike in Yemen, which is long-understood as a safe space for terrorists and other adversaries to the United States. The Department of Defense does not discuss alleged operations in the region,"" said Navy Commander Rebecca Rebarich, a Pentagon spokesman.  The Washington Post first reported the development.  A US drone strike on January 3 killed Soleimani shortly after he landed at Baghdad International Airport. Trump administration officials have justified the killing as an act of self-defence, saying he was planning military acts that threatened large numbers of US military and diplomatic officials in the Middle East. Iran, however, called the attack an act of terrorism, and on Wednesday launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq that house US and coalition forces. No one was killed in that retaliation.  The unsuccessful operation against Shahlai may indicate that the Trump administration's killing of Soleimani last week was part of a broader operation than previously explained, raising questions about whether the mission was designed to cripple the leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or solely to prevent an imminent attack on Americans as originally stated.  The Trump administration has been under fire by Democrats and two Republicans in Congress over its decision to order the attack that killed Soleimani.  In an interview that aired on Fox News on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged that the US did not know ""precisely"" when or where the imminent attacks allegedly being planned by top Iranian commander Qassemi Soleimani would take place, but said the threat was ""real"".  Trump on Friday said Iran probably had targeted the US embassy in Baghdad and was aiming to attack four US embassies.  ""We will tell you probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad,"" Trump said in a clip of an interview on Fox News. ""I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies.""

Deputy superintendent Davinder Singh had worked for the police for decades and was a member of an elite counter-insurgency force in the disputed territory, which both India and Pakistan claim in full.  He was apprehended late on Saturday, January 11, when his vehicle was pulled over at a police checkpoint south of Srinigar, the region's main city.  ""The fast moving car was stopped and searched. Two wanted militants and our officer...and a third person were arrested in the operation,"" Kashmir police chief Vijay Kumar told reporters.  Kumar said police and intelligence agencies were questioning Singh, accusing the officer of a ""heinous crime.""  Security forces recovered guns and ammunition from several locations in the follow up to the arrests, including from Singh's residence in Srinagar.  Hours after the 4 men were detained, police killed 3 alleged rebels during a gunfight in southern Kashmir's Tral district, where the arrested militants were based.  One of those arrested was Naveed Baba, the deputy commander of the local rebel outfit Hizbul Mujahideen.  Baba had stolen 4 assault rifles and deserted the police force to join the militant group in 2017, according to police.  Singh had risen steadily through the ranks of the Kashmir security apparatus during his career and was last year awarded a medal by the Indian president for his service.  But years earlier he was accused of forcing a man to help armed militants travel to New Delhi in a deadly attack on the Indian parliament in 2001.  Twelve people including five attackers were killed in the attack, which India blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ prompting a months-long military stand-off that brought the two nuclear-armed countries to the brink of war.  India had accused Pakistan based militant groups of launching the attack and resulted in a months-long military stand-off at the border with Pakistan before both the armies retreated under international pressure.  Singh acknowledged in 2006 he had tortured his accuser, Mohammad Afzal Guru, while he was in custody, but the claims were not taken seriously by investigators. Guru was later convicted for his part in the attack and hanged.  Kumar told Sunday's press conference that the allegations would now be revisited.  ""We will ask him about the attack in the interrogation,"" the police chief said.  Decades of rebellion  Scores of militant groups in Kashmir have fought India's administration of the territory since an armed rebellion broke out more than three decades ago.  Police and Indian troops are routinely accused of human rights abuses against the local population.  Security across the territory has been tightened since August 5, when India revoked Kashmir's semi-autonomous status, arrested the region's top political leaders and imposed a security and communications blockade.

The woman was quarantined after landing in Bangkok from Wuhan, eastern China, where the outbreak began in December.  One person has died and 41 cases of the virus have been recorded so far.  It has been identified as a coronavirus, which can cause illnesses ranging from common colds to potentially deadly Sars.  Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - killed more than 700 people around the world during an outbreak in 2002-3, after originating in China.  In total, it infected more than 8,000 people in 26 countries.  China has been free of Sars since May 2004.

They said the towns of Khan al Subl, Maasaran and several others in southern Idlib province were targeted after a two-day lull in aerial strikes against the last rebel bastion that had been pounded for over a month in a renewed assault.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Russian air strikes have shattered two days of relative calm that gave people a small relief from daily raids,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mohamad Rashid, an activist, said.  Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Idlib province in recent weeks as Russian jets and Syrian artillery pounded towns and villages in a renewed government assault aimed at clearing the opposition.  Senior UN officials said this month that the humanitarian situation had become more acute with at least 300,000 civilians now on the run in Idlib province, adding to the more than half a million people who fled earlier bouts of fighting to the safety of camps near the Turkish border.  The latest offensive had brought the Russian-led military campaign closer to heavily crowded parts of Idlib province, where nearly 3 million people are trapped, the vast majority of whom are women and children, according to the United Nations.  Moscow says its forces, along with the Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias fighting alongside them, are fending off terror attacks by al Qaeda militants whom they say hit populated, government-held areas.  However, they accuse the rebels of wrecking a Ã¢â‚¬Å“deescalation zoneÃ¢â‚¬Â brokered two years ago between Turkey and Russia.  Moscow announced earlier this week it had opened safe corridors to allow people under opposition rule in Idlib province to flee to government-held areas.  Residents say few people have crossed into state-controlled areas, where they fear retribution, and most have headed to the relative safety of areas near the Turkish border.  Many of the residents of the opposition enclave fear the return of President Bashar al AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authoritarian rule and look to Turkey to halt the Russian-led campaign that has killed hundreds and left dozens of towns and villages in ruins.

For most Nigerians, the war over the breakaway state of Biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten, but for the Igbo people who fought for secession, it remains a life-defining event.  In 1967, following two coups and turmoil which led to about a million Igbos returning to the south-east of Nigeria, the Republic of Biafra seceded with 33-year-old military officer Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu at the helm.  The Nigerian government declared war and after 30 months of fighting, Biafra surrendered. On 15 January 1970, the conflict officially ended.  The government's policy of ""no victor, no vanquished"" may have led to a lack of official reflection, but many Nigerians of Igbo origin grew up on stories from people who lived through the war.  Three of those who were involved in the secessionist campaign have been sharing their memories.  'We thought we were magicians'  Christopher Ejike Ago, soldier  He had just finished grammar school and started training as a veterinary assistant at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), in south-eastern Nigeria, when the civil war began.  Almost every student he knew became part of the war effort.  He joined the Biafran army and was assigned to the signal unit, whose responsibilities included ""active intelligence and eavesdropping on the Nigerian military"".  Christopher Ejike Ago The Nigerians who were pursuing us were trained soldiers... We were drafted into the war, given two days' training.""  ""We thought we were magicians,"" said 76-year-old Mr Ago.  ""The Nigerians who were pursuing us were trained soldiers. We were not. We were drafted into the war, given two days' training.  ""Plus the fact that we were hungry. Some of us, our skin was getting rotten. Nobody can fight a war like that.""  In January 1966, some senior Nigerian army officers, mostly of the Igbo ethnic group, assassinated key politicians during a coup in the West African state.  Those killed included Ahmadu Bello, a revered leader in the north.  This led to months of massacres against the Igbo living in the north. Tens of thousands were killed while about a million fled to what was then known as the Eastern Region.  Image copyright Mirrorpix Image caption Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, pictured here in June 1968, was a charismatic figure  These events sparked the Igbo's decision to secede, spearheaded by Ojukwu, who was then the military governor of the Eastern Region.  In the months preceding the war, Ojukwu often visited UNN, the only university in south-eastern Nigeria at the time, to meet with students and prepare them for secession.  Mr Ago looked forward to these visits, and joined the crowd who gathered at the university's Freedom Square.  ""Once his helicopter touched down, everybody went there and, practically, school shut down.  ""He had this incredible sense of humour. He spiked everybody up and we formed songs and were singing and enjoying ourselves.""  In the first year of the war, the Nigerian government captured the coastal city of Port Harcourt and imposed a blockade, which cut food supplies to Biafra.  Image copyright Evening Standard Image caption Nigerian troops seen in one of Biafra's main cities, Port Harcourt, in 1968 after fierce fighting  Mr Ago remembers the overpowering hunger that often forced Biafran soldiers to catch and eat mice. He also remembers the last year of the war when his unit was continuously on the move, fleeing the advancing Nigerian army.  ""Somewhere in the middle of the war,"" he said, ""the Biafrans made some dramatic successes that gave us hope that we might hold the Nigerians until at least some help from outside came.""  By late 1969, all hope was lost.

He collected his portion from an allocation of raw rice to his unit, then set off towards the village of a relative, where he suspected his parents and siblings would be holed up.  ""I had to carry the rice while starving myself, carrying it across rivers and forests until I found them,"" he said.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hunger caused the deaths of many people during the conflict  Many of his friends and classmates had died at the battlefront. But his family was delighted to see that the son and brother they assumed dead was alive. And they were glad that he had turned up with food.  Hunger killed more Biafrans than bullets and bombs.  When the university was reopened a few months after the war ended, Mr Ago returned to UNN, eventually graduating with a degree in plant and soil science.  ""I think we would have done better if we had handled it with a little bit more intelligence,"" said Mr Ago. ""I think now that OjukwuÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ thought he was Jesus Christ.  ""He thought he could do magic. If he had slowed down and allowed some people who were with him to advise him properly, we would have come out better than we did.""  'They only had knives and cutlasses'  Felix Nwankwo Oragwu, scientist  He was a physics lecturer at UNN when the civil war began.  For the next 30 months, he headed the Research and Production (RAP) group comprising Igbo scientists from various fields.  Its primary responsibility was to provide technological support to the Biafran army, which was poorly equipped.  Felix Nwankwo Oragwu When the war started, there was not a single weapon... anywhere throughout Biafra. No gun, no bomb, no nothing.""  The RAP's most notable product was the ""ogbunigwe"", a weapons launcher of remarkable and devastating effect which influenced the outcome of many battles in Biafra's favour, according to historical reports.  ""Without us, the war would have lasted only about 30 hours,"" said the 85-year-old.  ""When the war started, there was not a single weapon either in a store or anywhere throughout Biafra. They only had knives and cutlasses. No gun, no bomb, no nothing.""  In the aftermath of the war, the Nigerian government did not want to impose any form of collective punishment.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Felix Nwankwo Oragwu and others helped develop some of the weapons that Biafran soldiers used  Nevertheless, the Igbo faced some devastating consequences, particularly economically as the Biafran currency that people had accumulated became worthless.  Many Igbo still feel sidelined in Nigerian politics, as since the civil war no-one from the ethnic group has become president.  Increasing cries of marginalisation have led in recent years to the emergence of Igbo groups agitating once again for secession, particularly the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), formed by UK-based British-Nigerian Nnamdi Kanu.

""Biafra would have been a technological nation and would have been able to compete with anybody,"" he said, anger in his voice.  ""That is what makes me sad. By this time, we would have been competing with at least South Korea.""  The scientist's wartime accomplishments had caught the attention of the Nigerian authorities and he was invited by the government to pioneer a special science and technology programme for the country.  He was behind the setting up of four universities of science and technology in different regions of Nigeria and after retirement he published Scientific and Technological Innovations in Biafra, a book he hoped would inspire young Nigerians.  ""Nigeria was programmed by the British colonial authorities not to participate in production and manufacture of global technologies,"" he wrote in the book.  ""The war gave the opportunity toÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ reject the colonial design.""  'An incredible period'  Edna Nwanunobi, teacher  She was teaching English and French in a secondary school in Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria when the civil war began.  While the UK backed Nigeria, France was the most prominent supporter of Biafra.  But English was more widely spoken in Biafra, so translators were needed whenever French officials visited Ojukwu.  Edna Nwanunobi ""You were forced to fraternise with your people more than any time before""  Ms Nwanunobi joined the Biafran ministry of foreign affairs as part of a handful of translators who worked directly with Ojukwu.  ""The war was an incredible period,"" said 82-year-old Mrs Nwanunobi. ""Everybody was forced to go home so you were forced to fraternise with your people more than any time before.  ""And people who worked in every Biafra office were high level people. These were people who were doing all sorts of things and the war forced them out of their positions.""

If any meeting lasted more than two hours, he wouldn't be party to it.""  Her most memorable assignment occurred after the Biafran military captured six Italian oil workers employed by the Nigerian government.  Officials from different European countries travelled to meet Ojukwu to appeal for their release.  ""That was the largest assembly we had,"" she recalled. ""Even the Vatican sent representatives.""  During the meeting, Mrs Nwanunobi conveyed to Ojukwu that he stood the risk of losing European support.  He promised to consider the matter, and the Italians were subsequently released.

A few days later, she left the country for the Biafran office in Paris. During a stopover of several days in Lisbon, she heard that Biafra had surrendered.  Her first concern was for Ojukwu.  ""I was worried that he would come to harm,"" she said softly. ""I didn't want anybody to disgrace him.""  Her worry lifted when she learned that her boss had escaped in his private jet, and was granted asylum by Ivory Coast, a francophone country.  Mrs Nwanunobi spent much of the 1970s in Canada before returning to Nigeria in 1977, where she resumed work as a secondary school teacher.

He died in November 2011 and was given a full military burial in a ceremony attended by then Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, some other African leaders and members of the diplomatic corps.  Fifty years after the Biafran conflict, Nigeria is still battling to maintain its unity, with various groups, not just the Igbo, calling for the restructuring of Africa's most populous state.  It is probably for this reason that the war is barely mentioned.

Macron had called for the meeting in the southwestern city of Pau in December, complaining of a lack of ""clear political condemnation of anti-French feelings"" among the countries comprising the G5 Sahel organisation and threatening a withdrawal of 4,500 French troops stationed in the region in the wake of a series of anti-France protests.  More:  At the summit, France committed an extra 220 troops to Barkhane, its military force countering armed groups in the region. Paris also pledged to implement an intelligence-sharing agreement and integrated military command structure with the G5 nations and said it would ramp up intervention in the ""tri-borders"" region of Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, where much of the violence that began plaguing the area in 2012 has taken place.  But although Macron promised more support and the G5 nations expressed a desire for continued French military involvement, analysts suggest the leaders failed to address political solutions to a crisis which killed more than 4,000 people in 2019.  ""Macron got what he wanted [in Pau], which is a clear and strong reaffirmation by the G5 Sahel countries for French military engagement in the region,"" said Flore Berger, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.  ""While Macron implied [in December] that he could withdraw troops ... this was never a realistic option. The tendency is towards closer cooperation and more involvement. France cannot afford to leave Mali now that the situation is sharply deteriorating.""  Barkhane has so far produced scant results in stemming the security crisis, with attacks in Mali and Burkina Faso currently occurring on a near-daily basis.  Meanwhile, in recent weeks Niger has experienced a string of big attacks on army posts, including one in Inates on December 10 that killed 71 soldiers and another in Changodar on January 9 that left 89 troops dead.  Paul Melly, an analyst at Chatham House, pointed out that the leaders in Pau ""publicly stated, for the first time, that the priority focus"" will be the campaign against the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), an ISIL affiliate that has staged a wave of deadly attacks in recent months.  But many analysts appear to agree that a continuation of France's military strategy will not bring a swift end to the violence, stressing that political goals need to be met for a return to peace.  ""The announcements made seem to further entrench a military strategy led by France that has been failing to provide security and stability in the region for years now,"" said Joe Penny, a journalist and co-founder of The Sahelien, a news site focused on the region.  ""Where are the efforts beyond sending more troops and giving more control to the French military? Why haven't key elements of the Algiers peace agreement been implemented, almost six years later?"" he asked.  The Algiers peace agreement, signed in the Malian capital of Bamako in 2015, was designed to reduce violence in Mali and the wider region. Alongside military intervention undertaken by France, the United Nations and G5 countries, it outlined targets for development which have not been met.  Many areas of the Sahel that have seen the most fighting are severely underdeveloped. Armed groups are exploiting poverty as well as religious and ethnic divisions to recruit fighters and stoke more violence.  Many analysts see this as the root cause of the crisis and were disappointed to see it is not being properly addressed in Pau. Few think what was agreed at the summit will mean anything other than maintaining the status-quo of current military intervention in the Sahel.  ""France needed to raise the stakes and stage a spectacle to show that its troops are deployed at the request of the African governments,"" said Judd Devermont, director of the Africa programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  ""Most of the other announcements - a modest troop increase and a unified command structure - are unlikely to change the strategic picture.""",en,terrorattack,900,['France']

The outbreak, which has killed one person, has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003.  One of the 41 patients reported in the city could have been infected by her husband, Wuhan's health commission said in a statement on Wednesday.  The announcement follows news that a Chinese woman had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in Thailand after travelling there from Wuhan.  No human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the health commission said the possibility ""cannot be excluded"".  The commission said that one man who had been diagnosed worked at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which has been identified as the centre of the outbreak, but his wife had been diagnosed with the illness despite reporting ""no history of exposure"" at the market.  At a press conference on Wednesday following a fact-finding trip to Wuhan, Hong Kong health officials also said that the possibility of human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out despite no ""definitive evidence"".  Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection, said there were two family group cases among the recorded cases in Wuhan, including the husband and wife and a separate case of a father, son and nephew living together.  However, he said mainland doctors believed the three men were most likely to have been exposed to the same virus in the market.  The market has been closed since January 1.  The woman diagnosed in Thailand, who is currently in a stable condition, had not reported visiting the seafood market, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.  WHO doctor Maria Van Kerkhove said Tuesday that they ""wouldn't be surprised if there was some limited human-to-human transmission, especially among families who have close contact with one another"".  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a Level 1 ""Watch"" alert for travellers to Wuhan after the patient was diagnosed in Thailand, saying they should practice normal precautions and avoid contact with animals and sick people.  Wuhan's health commission said on Wednesday that most of the patients diagnosed with the virus were male, and many were middle-aged or elderly.  In Hong Kong, hospitals have raised their alert level to ""serious"" and stepped up detection measures including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers.  Hong Kong authorities said on Tuesday that the number of people hospitalised with fever or respiratory symptoms in recent days after travelling to Wuhan had grown to 71, including 7 new cases since Friday.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) said yesterday that there has not been an outbreak of DENV-3 virus here in the past three decades. This means there is low immunity in the population to this serotype.  There are four dengue serotypes, with the outbreaks here caused by DENV-1 and DENV-2. DENV-2 has been the dominant strain since 2016. DENV-3 generally accounts for a minority of cases.  The NEA said in a statement: ""We have seen an increase in dengue virus serotype 3 cases and clusters over the past month.  ""As Singapore has not seen a DENV-3 outbreak in the last three decades, the population immunity for DENV-3 is low and, therefore, (people are) more susceptible to transmission of the virus. It is thus critical that all residents and stakeholders work closely together with NEA to break the dengue transmission in these clusters, and curtail the spread of the virus.""  It added that DENV-3 infections have been detected in three of the six largest clusters - in Jalan Bangau, Cashew Road and Jalan Paras.  Dengue infections have been on the rise for three weeks. Last week, 345 people were diagnosed with dengue - a 50 per cent rise over the number of infections seen in mid-December. This is the highest number of infections seen at this time of the year, since 2016.  Said the NEA: ""The high Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the community, the current high number of dengue cases, and the increase in circulation of DENV-3 could lead to weekly dengue cases rising above current levels in 2020.""  Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said: ""The recent increase in the proportion of DENV-3 cases could raise the likelihood of having more clinical cases because of the probable lower herd immunity.""

NEA also warned that the mosquito population, which is already high, may go up some more with the advent of warmer months.  It added that in some of the large dengue clusters, ""we have detected mosquito breeding multiple times in the same homes"".  At Bukit Mugliston, for example, mosquito breeding was discovered more than once in 10 homes. In all, 85 people have been infected in the cluster which has been active since October, including eight over the past fortnight.

He stressed that as for travellers found to be having fever or fever symptoms, further examination will be conducted at a health quarantine centre or screening facility at the international entry point (of the traveller).  ""Screening of patients at health clinics and emergency departments at hospitals will also be tightened so as to ensure that suspected cases are handled as per the preventive measures,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.

LONDON, : The Fitbit on your wrist not only counts your steps and minutes of sleep, it can also help tell if you're coming down with the flu: and warn health authorities to get ready to help.  A study in the United States has found that heart rate and sleep data from wearable fitness tracker watches can predict and alert public health officials to real-time outbreaks of flu more accurately than current surveillance methods.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The study used data from more than 47,000 Fitbit users in five U.S. states. The results, published in The Lancet Digital Health journal, showed that by using Fitbit data, state-wide predictions of flu outbreaks were improved and accelerated.  The World Health Organization estimates that as many as 650,000 people worldwide die of respiratory diseases linked to seasonal flu each year.  Traditional surveillance reporting takes up to three weeks, meaning response measures - such as deploying vaccines or anti-virals and advising patients to stay at home - can often lag.  ""Responding more quickly to influenza outbreaks can prevent further spread and infection, and we were curious to see if sensor data could improve real-time surveillance,"" said Jennifer Radin, who co-led that study at the U.S. Scripps Research Translational Institute.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Previous studies using crowd-sourced data - such as Google Flu Trends and Twitter - have experienced variable success, partly, experts say, because it is impossible to separate out behaviour of people with flu from people who search online about it due to more media and public attention during outbreaks.  For this study, Radin's team de-identified data from 200,000 people whose Fitbits tracked activity, heart rate and sleep for at least 60 days during the March 2016 to March 2018 study period. From the 200,000, 47,248 users from California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania wore a Fitbit consistently during the period. The average age was 43 and 60per cent were female.  Users' resting heart rate and sleep duration were monitored and flagged as abnormal if the average weekly heart rate was significantly above their overall average and their weekly average sleep was not below their overall average.  This data was compared to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's weekly estimates for flu-like illness.  Rosalind Eggo, a public health expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the study suggests fitness trackers hold some promise as a disease surveillance tool.

Symptoms of coronaviruses can range from fever and coughing to kidney failure, and in some cases lead to death.  But the new coronavirus in Wuhan appears to not be as lethal as MERS, or SARS, which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003.  Currently, 41 cases of the new coronavirus have been reported in Wuhan, central China's largest city. Five of those patients are in serious condition while 12 have been discharged after treatment, local health authorities said. Other patients are stable and under treatment.  In total, 763 people who had close contact with the infected patients have been traced. Of those, 644 people have been discharged and 119 are still under medical observation, but no infected cases have been found among them, according to health officials.  The man who died on Wednesday fell ill on December 31 and was admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital five days later, where his condition worsened.  Health officials said he suffered from abnormal renal function, inflammation of the heart muscle and severe damage to multiple organ functions. Scans also showed lung damage with possible tuberculosis.  Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team conduct searches on the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.  Thailand confirmed its second case of the new coronavirus on Thursday -- the third case in total found outside of China. The virus was also confirmed Thursday to have been detected in Japan. In all three cases, the infected people had traveled to Wuhan.  In Wuhan, the first, and the majority, of the infected patients have been traced to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which has been shut down for disinfection since January 1. Wuhan health authorities said on Wednesday that some ""environmental samples"" taken from the market tested positive for the virus.  Apart from fish, the market also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes -- sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals, just like SARS and MERS.  The outbreak has cast a shadow over celebrations for Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25, and put the rest of Asia on edge. Hundreds of millions of people in China are expected to travel over the course of the new year period, both within the country and overseas.  Japan has confirmed a case of a new coronavirus that emerged in China, authorities said on January 16.  Researchers have yet to rule out the possibility that the virus could be transmitted from person to person and virologists around the world are now studying its genome sequence shared by Chinese researchers.  On Wednesday, Hong Kong's Food and Health officials said there is a ""limited"" chance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, though added that such a possibility could not be ignored.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a Watch Level 1 Alert -- the lowest of a three-tier travel health notice that warns visitors to Wuhan to ""be aware and practice usual precautions.""",en,diseas,,

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports will begin later on Friday and focus on travellers to the United States via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan.  Advertisement  Advertisement  So far, the new virus has spread outside of China to Japan and Thailand, and CDC officials said in a conference call with reporters that they expect more cases will be reported outside of China. The risk to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said.  Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said in a conference call that the CDC will be sending about 100 additional staff to the three airports - Los Angeles International, San Francisco International and New York's John F. Kennedy International - to supplement existing staff at quarantine stations located at those airports.  Under the screening procedures, travellers from Wuhan will be taken to a separate area in the airport, where they will complete a questionnaire and be checked for fever. Those with symptoms will be asked additional health- and exposure-related questions, and those needing more follow-up will be referred to a designated healthcare facility for more testing.  The coronavirus comes from a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a highly infectious virus that originated in China in 2002 and eventually traveled to 37 countries, killing 774 people.  Advertisement  Advertisement  So far, health officials do not consider the new virus from China to be as lethal as SARS, but the investigation is evolving and much is still not known about whether the virus can spread easily from person to person.  ""This is the stage of the investigation where we need to proceed cautiously and be prepared for any eventuality,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a CDC expert in respiratory diseases, said on the conference call.  China health officials report that most of the patients infected with the virus have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting the virus is new and has jumped from animals to humans.  It is still not clear how well the virus can be transmitted from person to person, but there are indications of some limited spread from person-to-person, CDC officials said.  The World Health Organization earlier this week provided guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered.  ",en,diseas,,

The move to cripple the country's main income source was a protest against Turkey's decision to send troops to shore up Haftar's rival, the head of Tripoli's UN-recognised government Fayez al-Sarraj.  Advertisement  Advertisement  It comes ahead of a conference in Berlin on Sunday that will see the United Nations try to extract a pledge from world leaders to stop meddling in the Libyan conflict -- be it through supplying troops, weapons or financing.  ""All foreign interference can provide some aspirin effect in the short term, but Libya needs all foreign interference to stop. That's one of the objectives of this conference,"" Ghassan Salame told AFP in an interview.  Leaders of Russia, Turkey and France are due to join the talks, held under the auspices of the UN.  Both Haftar and Sarraj are also expected at the gathering, the first of such scale on the conflict since 2018.  Advertisement  Advertisement  After months of combat, which has killed more than 2,000 people, a ceasefire took effect on January 12 backed by both Ankara and Moscow, which is accused of supporting Haftar.  But Saturday's blockade raised fears over the conflict.  The disruption to oil exports is expected to more than halve the country's daily crude production, to 500,000 barrels from 1.3 million barrels, translating to losses of $55 million a day, warned Libya's National Oil Company.  ""Our line at the UN is clear. Don't play with petrol because it's the livelihood of the Libyans,"" warned Salame just hours before the blockade.  ""Don't play with petrol, be it by turning it into a weapon of war or a way to cause divisions or as a bidding tool.""  The oil-rich North African country has been torn by fighting between rival armed factions since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi and toppled his regime.  More recently, Haftar's forces launched an assault in April on Sarraj's troops in Tripoli.  ""VICIOUS CYCLE""  Although Sarraj's government is recognised by the UN, some powerful players have broken away to stand behind Haftar - turning a domestic conflict into what is essentially a proxy war with international powers jostling to secure their own interests from global influence to oil and migration.  Alarm grew internationally when Ankara ordered in troops early January to help shore up Sarraj, while Moscow is suspected of providing weapons, financing and mercenaries to Haftar - something Russia has denied.  ""We must end this vicious cycle of Libyans calling for the help of foreign powers. Their intervention deepens the divisions among the Libyans,"" said Salame, noting that the place of international players should be to ""help Libyans develop themselves"".  The UN envoy said Sunday's meeting will also seek to ""consolidate"" the shaky ceasefire.  ""Today we only have a truce. We want to transform it into a real ceasefire with monitoring, separation (of rival camps), repositioning of heavy weapons"" outside urban zones, he said.  The UN had sought on multiple attempts to bid for peace, but talks have repeatedly collapsed.  ERDOGAN ISSUES WARNING  On the eve of the Berlin talks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Europe to stand united behind Sarraj's government, as Tripoli's fall could leave ""fertile ground"" for jihadist groups like IS or Al-Qaeda ""to get back on their feet"".  Erdogan also played up Europe's fears of a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis in his commentary for Politico news website, that further unrest could prompt a new wave of migrants to head for the continent.  Accusing France in particular of siding with Haftar, Erdogan said leaving Libya to the commander would be a ""mistake of historic proportions"".  France has denied it was backing Haftar. But a diplomatic source noted that the fact that the commander already controls 80 percent of Libya needed to be taken into account.  The European Union is watching with growing alarm at the escalating strife on its doorstep as it counts on Libya as a gatekeeper deterring migrants from crossing the Mediterranean.",en,terrorattack,904,"['Libya', 'Berlin']"

Scientists with the MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease Analysis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which advises bodies including the WHO Ã¢â‚¬â€œ said they estimated a ""total of 1,723"" people in Wuhan would have been infected as of January 12.  ""For Wuhan to have exported 3 cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported,"" Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the authors of the report, told the BBC.  ""I am substantially more concerned than I was a week ago,"" he said, while adding that it was ""too early to be alarmist.""  ""People should be considering the possibility of substantial human-to-human transmission more seriously than they have so far,"" he continued, saying it was ""unlikely"" that animal exposure was the sole source of infection.  Local authorities in Wuhan said a 69-year-old man died on Wednesday, January 15, becoming the second fatal case, with the disease causing pulmonary tuberculosis and damage to multiple organ functions.  After the death was reported, online discussion spread in China over the severity of the Wuhan coronavirus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and how much information the government may be hiding from the public.  Several complained about censorship of online posts, while others made comparisons to 2003, when Beijing drew criticism from the WHO for underreporting the number of SARS cases.

The National Health Commission said on Sunday (Jan 19) departments should work together to carry out preventative measures.    ""Our commission will step up our guard during the Spring Festival, pay close attention to the development and change of the epidemic, and direct the implementation of prevention and control measures,"" the commission said, adding that it believes the outbreak can be controlled.    Wuhan's health authority confirmed earlier on Sunday 17 more cases of the virus in the city, bringing the total number of known patients there to 62.    Two people have died from the virus in Wuhan, the largest city in central China with a population of about 11 million people. Three cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand and one in Japan - involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.    China, the World Health Organizations and authorities across the globe are stepping up efforts to contain the virus, which initially emerged in Wuhan in late December as a wave of pneumonia patients.    Many of China's 1.4 billion people will travel domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year break that begins next week, raising concerns about the virus spreading to other countries.    The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.    Though some experts say the new virus may not be as deadly as SARS, there is still little known about it including its origin and how easily it can be transmitted between humans.    The World Health Organisation said on Sunday that some of the new cases appear not to be linked to the Huanan seafood market, believed to be the centre of the outbreak. Due to China's efforts to implement broader screening, new cases may be identified in the coming days and weeks, it added.    ""The fact that three cases have been exported to Thailand and Japan without connection to the Huanan Seafood Market suggests that the virus has spread beyond the Huanan Seafood Market into the community,"" said David Hui, a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.    Wuhan will strengthen oversight of big events and reduce the number of public gatherings, state media quoted Chen Yanxin, the city's deputy mayor as saying on Sunday.    Wuhan officials said since Jan. 14 they are using infrared thermometers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals in the city to strengthen screening.    Airport authorities in the United States as well as most Asian nations are screening passengers from Wuhan.    A report by the London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said there are likely to be ""substantially more cases"". It estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. - Reuters  Article type: free User access status: 3",en,diseas,,

Health officials say the strain does not appear as lethal as some other strains of coronavirus such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome or Sars, which killed nearly 800 people worldwide during a 2002/2003 outbreak that also originated in China.  KNOWN CASES  As of yesterday, there were 65 confirmed cases of patients with pneumonia caused by the new strain of coronavirus. All patients were either Wuhan residents or people who recently went to the city. Their symptoms included fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.  Of the 62 patients in Wuhan itself, two have died and 19 have been discharged.  Thailand has also reported two confirmed cases of the pneumonia, both of whom were Chinese tourists from Wuhan. Japan has also confirmed one case of a Japanese citizen who visited Wuhan.  LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT VIRUS  The Chinese authorities say that the outbreak is strongly linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, but some patients diagnosed with the new coronavirus deny exposure to this market.  Health officials say there is no clear evidence that the virus spreads easily from one person to another, but they cannot completely rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission.  The Wuhan municipal authorities released information about a married couple who contracted the virus last Wednesday. The husband, who got sick first, worked at the market but the wife denied any exposure to the market in question.  The authorities did not explicitly state whether this was a case of human-to-human transmission.

The airport authorities in the United States as well as many Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea, have stepped up screening of passengers from Wuhan.

Wuhan Deputy Mayor ChenYanxin said the city is leaving nothing to chance and taking various steps to control the spread of the disease.  CONTROL MEASURES  Wuhan officials said they are screening all travellers in the central Chinese transport hub and monitoring all those who have had close contact with confirmed patients.

The photographers who came to cover the protests in my neighbourhood were always men.  Whenever I saw them, I imagined myself like them, taking pictures of the scenes before us.  I think all my pictures reflect day-to-day life in my homeland. In a conflict zone like ours, every picture in its own way, even in this beautiful Himalayan landscape, describes the tragedy of Kashmir. Masrat Zahra, photojournalist  An armed rebellion broke out against Indian rule in Kashmir in the early 1990s. Photojournalists have played an essential role in documenting the bloodshed and rights violations that followed.  Over the past three decades, journalism in Kashmir has emerged as one of the strongest institutions challenging the Indian government, with Kashmiri journalists working relentlessly to keep the story alive.    But it was not an easy choice for me to become a photojournalist.  I was raised in a conservative Muslim family. My father is a truck driver and my mother a homemaker. My parents wanted me to pursue a university degree that would lead to a government job. But I defied their wishes and instead went to journalism school.  Four years after I became a photojournalist, my parents now support what I do.  But photojournalism is still not considered an acceptable career choice for women in Kashmir, where society expects us to stay at home or work in jobs with office hours.  Kashmir through the eyes of its women  Being a female photographer in the field can be frustrating at times. People stare at me because they are not used to seeing a woman with a camera.  I was once harassed on social media and called a ""mukhbir"", or an informer of the Indian army, after people saw a picture of me covering a gunfight. They simply could not understand why a woman would be photographing this because they had not seen it before.  There are other risks as well. Apart from being exposed to the dangers of conflict, journalists have been openly beaten, intimidated and attacked.  But what drove me - and still does - to become a journalist was wanting to show women's perspectives, and to explore my own, too.  The stories and perspectives of women have largely been ignored and buried in the Kashmiri and international media. They have hardly been spoken about - their losses, their resilience.  I wanted to document the untold stories of women and to talk to them. I knew women in my neighbourhood wanted to speak. They were suffering, but would hide their faces and feel uncomfortable opening up to male journalists.  A rebel's funeral  Taken last year, this picture makes me think of the immense and silent suffering of those who have lost loved ones in this conflict.  It was stormy in the early hours of May 24, 2019, when I set out with other journalists to cover the funeral of prominent rebel commander Zakir Musa. For Kashmiris, the civil engineering student-turned-militant was a popular face of Kashmir's new generation of rebels. He was the founder of Ansar Ghazwat-Ul-Hind, a rebel outfit that had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda.  We had to get to Noorpora, a village in south Kashmir's Tral district, about 30km away. I was prepared to ride there on my motorbike, but fortunately, a fellow journalist offered me a ride.  The night was foggy and full of police patrols and security checkpoints. The armed forces had sealed off all entry points to the village and journalists were not allowed through. We changed routes often to evade security. When we arrived, we walked the final 3km in the rain through the crowd heading to the funeral.  The road to the house where the rebel was killed was a sea of mud. Puffs of smoke rose from the burned remains of the cement structure. Thousands of people had gathered around it.  Some men told me to leave. They would not allow me inside. ""She doesn't have manners,"" I heard them whispering. ""What is she doing here among the men?""  I am used to these words by now. They do not affect me.  The empty bed  I found another way in. When Musa's body reached the funeral ground, I was in an attic, preparing for high-angle shots and standing on the edge of the roof. The noise from the slogan-shouting crowd seemed to shake my camera, but I was able to take some pictures of the body before it was taken away to be buried.  The bodies of Kashmiris killed by the Indian armed forces are not taken to the graveyard in a closed coffin. Masrat Zahra, photojournalist  Then, before I put my camera away, I peeped into the viewfinder and saw the empty bed where the rebel's body had been. I took this picture.  For me, the empty bed had a different story to tell, far more haunting than the story it told with a dead body on it. It was the void the frequent killings of fighters and ordinary women and men leave behind in their families.  The bodies of Kashmiris killed by the Indian armed forces are not taken to the graveyard in a closed coffin. They are considered heroes or martyrs and are often carried out on metal beds or stretchers - taken from the hospitals where families have gone to identify them - so everyone can see them.  This picture makes me think of how these beds carry the bodies of young men, women, children, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers before they are gone forever. I think about families coming to kiss them for the last time on those beds. These beds share a connection of death and grief.  Although there are largely men in this picture, I imagine the women - a mother, sister, wife or daughter, looking at the bed a loved one once slept in, and the loneliness and emptiness this brings. I think of their pain.  Lives lost  I think all my pictures reflect day-to-day life in my homeland. In a conflict zone like ours, every picture in its own way, even in this beautiful Himalayan landscape, describes the tragedy of Kashmir. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict, most of them civilians.  This picture also reminds me of my very first news assignment in August 2017. I had to meet the family of Firdous Ahmad Khan, a labourer killed in a gunfight in the southern Kashmiri district of Pulwama. I was worried that his family would not speak to me, or that security forces would stop me. I was afraid of failing to tell the story.  But when I met Firdous' widow Ruksana, then 25 and soon to give birth to their second child, she hugged me and cried and told me about the pain of losing her husband. She was burdened and desperate to speak, and could open up to another woman.  While her story made me extremely sad, I felt a responsibility to tell it. I watched Ruksana's two-year-old daughter embracing her father on a metal bed, kissing and touching his face for the last time before he was separated from them forever and another empty bedframe returned to the hospital.

New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/rappler/~3/klkfdeGmmEo/249739-what-coronavirus-new-disease-spreading-asia-sars-fears,,20/1/2020 20:12,"PARIS, France Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A mysterious SARS-like virus has spread around China with more than 200 diagnosed cases in the cities of Wuhan, Beijing and Shenzhen, plus two people infected in Thailand and another case confirmed in Japan. Here are a few key points about coronavirus.  What is coronavirus?  The UN's health agency says that the outbreak of the disease in Wuhan is a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS.  According to Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at Institut Pasteur in Paris, the new strain is the seventh known type of coronavirus that humans can contract.  ""We think that the source may have been animals sold at market and from there it passed to the human population,"" he told AFP.  The World Health Organization (WHO) says an ""animal source seems the most likely primary source... with some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.""  The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003.  Fontanet said the current virus strain was 80 percent genetically identical to SARS.  A total of 201 people have now been diagnosed with the virus in China, and the outbreak has already claimed 3 lives.  Time to panic?  Fontanet said that the coronavirus appears to be ""weaker"" than SARS in its current form, but cautioned that it could mutate into a more virulent strain.  ""We don't have evidence that says this virus is going to mutate, but that's what happened with SARS,"" he said.  ""The virus has only been circulating a short time, so it's too early to say.""  As for person-to-person transmission Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a key hallmark of pandemics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it may also be too early to tell for sure.  But Wuhan authorities said over the weekend that some of the new cases had ""no history of contact"" with the seafood market believed to be the center of the outbreak.  Authorities have pronounced the risk of human transmission ""weak"" but not impossible.  Fontanet said the fact that the virus had spread beyond China, to Japan and Thailand, was ""starting to make us fear that interhuman transmission is possible.""  Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper last week that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be close to 1,700, much higher than the number officially identified.  WHO has advised that individuals should protect themselves against the virus by thoroughly washing their hands, covering their noses when they sneeze, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with wild or farm animals.  The best way of containing any disease outbreak is to rapidly confirm the source, according to Raina MacIntyre, from the University of New South Wales in Sydney.  ""Tests are being done on animals in the Wuhan region and they should provide some insight,"" she said.  Experts said authorities must be vigilant and monitor travellers coming to and from Wuhan for signs of breathing problems.  Lessons learned?  Fontanet said health workers in China had responded admirably by rapidly carrying out testing among patients and linking the cases to the market in question.  ""We've learned some lessons from SARS. We're better armed and more reactive,"" he said.  Adam Kamradt-Scott, an expert in the spread and control of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, said China had ""has been quick to share the genome sequencing of this novel coronavirus"".  ""This has enabled the identification of this new case in Japan,"" he said.  Fontanet said that such transparency was different to the start of the SARS epidemic, when China ""hid the story for two or 3 months"" at the start of the outbreak. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,diseas,,

The Progress Party's leader, who is also Norway's finance minister, will resign from the government and remove her party from the four-party coalition, robbing the prime minister of her parliamentary majority.  Siv Jensen made good on her threat to leave the government after a 29-year-old Norwegian-Pakistani woman arrived in Norway on Saturday with her son, five, and daughter, three.  Image: Populist Party leader Siv Jensen (L) has threatened to leave the coalition with prime minister Erna Solberg (R)  She is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2013 and married a Norwegian-Chilean IS fighter called Bastian Vasquez, who is believed to have died, before she married another fighter.  ""I brought us into government, and I'm now bringing the party out,"" Ms Jensen told a news conference on Monday afternoon.  Advertisement  The decision to bring the IS bride back to Norway, accompanied by police, was made on ""humanitarian grounds"" over fears one of her children is seriously ill, minister of foreign affairs Ine Eriksen Soreide said.  The mother, who has not been named, was arrested on arrival for ""participation in a terrorist organisation"" and taken with her children to hospital.  But the Progress Party, Norway's third largest, believe she used her child to get her out of the Al Hol camp in northeastern Syria where she has been held since March 2019 with thousands of other women and children.  The mother had refused to let the sick child travel alone to Norway.  ""Many believe she used her child as a shield to come back to Norway,"" said Ms Jensen. ""There are many in Norway who are displeased by this, not just in the Progress Party.""  Image: About 74,000 women and children linked to Islamic State are held in the Al Hol camp  She said she did not feel her party was consulted in the woman's repatriation decision and she faced pressure from local Progress Party leaders to take a stand and pull the party out of the delicate coalition.  Her party had offered to help the children but does not want to provide any government assistance for adults seeking to return home after joining Islamist groups abroad or marrying foreign fighters.  Despite losing her majority, prime minister Erna Solberg, head of the Conservative Party and nicknamed Iron Erna after Margaret Thatcher, is expected to remain in office as head of a minority coalition.  Speaking ahead of the Progress Party's decision to pull out, the prime minister said: ""A majority in the government believed that the concern for the child was paramount.""  A court hearing to determine the condition and length of the woman's custody is happening on Monday.  Under Norwegian law she faces up to six years in prison for participating in a terrorist organisation.  Ms Solberg's Conservatives entered into a coalition with the Progress Party as a minority government in 2013 before the Liberal Party joined them in 2018 and the Christian Democratic Party joined in 2019.  The government risked collapse in 2018 after opposition parties said they would not support a no-confidence motion in then-justice minister Sylvi Listhaug who accused the the centre-left Labour opposition party of believing ""terrorists' rights are more important than the nation's security"".  Labour and its youth organisation were the main targets of Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people with a bomb in Oslo and a shooting attack on a youth camp on the island of Utoya in 2011.

The authorities also said 15 healthcare workers have been diagnosed with pneumonia, confirming that there has been human-to-human transmission.  The outbreak sent jitters through Asian markets as the number of cases more than tripled on Monday to over 200.  The latest victim was a 89-year-old man who developed symptoms on Jan 13 and was admitted to hospital five days later after he experienced severe breathing difficulties, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement. He died on Jan 19.  It said the patient also had underlying health diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease.  In a separate statement posted on its official Weibo account, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 15 medical workers in the city had been diagnosed with pneumonia, with one other suspected case.  Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition, it added.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed that the new pathogen is being transmitted among humans, and not just from animals to humans as was originally hoped.  That puts the virus in a category similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or Sars, which killed almost 800 people 17 years ago. That ailment also represented a high risk to health-care workers.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The risk from this virus causing pandemonium has increased because it is spreading from different countries, and we are now seeing that it can be more easily transmitted from person to person,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dr Sanjaya Senanayake, associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University.  In comparison with Sars, he said, ""the one good factor, I guess, at the moment seems to be the low mortality rate"".  Asian shares fell as investors likened the outbreak to the 2002-2003 spread of Sars, another coronavirus that broke out in China.  ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yuan was down nearly half a per cent and on track for its worst day in a month, while airline and travel stocks fell across the region.  ""Because of Chinese New Year, millions of people will make a move to their home towns across China, which is making the whole situation uncontrollable,"" said Ms Margaret Yang, an analyst at brokerage CMC Markets in Singapore, referring to the Chinese holiday period which formally begins on Friday.  ""The sell-off is just the beginning; we will see more in days to come.""  The outbreak, which began in Wuhan, has spread to more Chinese cities, including the capital Beijing and Shanghai, and four cases have been reported outside the country's borders, in South Korea, Thailand and Japan.  The authorities confirmed a total of 217 new cases of the virus in China as of 6pm on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan.  In Shanghai, officials on Tuesday confirmed a second case involving a 35-year-man who had visited Wuhan in early January, and said they were monitoring four other suspected cases.

With the Chinese New Year just days away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a holiday season during which the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s citizens rack up three billion trips across the country to reunite with family Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the spread of the virus could intensify.  ""The outbreak of a Sars-like coronavirus in Wuhan is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region, now that there is medical evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" said Mr Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific Chief Economist for IHS Markit, in an e-mail statement.  ""Since the 2003 Sars crisis, ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s international tourism has boomed, so the risks of a global Sars-like virus epidemic spreading globally have become even more severe.""  ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health commission has decided to include the coronavirus in the Class B infectious diseases category, which includes Sars, while taking preventive steps typically used for the most-serious ailments, such as cholera and plague, according to a notice posted on the website late on Monday.  Other countries are on alert, stepping up screening of incoming travellers. International airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco started screening from late last Friday, joining cities in Asia that implemented surveillance measure days after the outbreak was reported on Dec 31.  In Singapore, temperature checks at Changi Airport will be expanded to cover all travellers flying in from China.  ""From a public health point of view, both at a national and international level, you have to assume the worst-case scenario - so the Sars scenario - where you had cases going from Hong Kong to all over the world,"" said Dr Senanayake.  The WHO will convene a meeting of its emergency committee on Jan 22 in Geneva, according to an e-mailed statement. Members will discuss ""whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it"".  So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions but such measures could be discussed at WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emergency meeting.",en,diseas,,

The news came as the World Health Organization said it would consider declaring an international public health emergency over the outbreak.  The coronavirus, which has spread to three other Asian countries and infected more than 200 people in China, has caused alarm because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.  The discovery of human-to-human transmission comes as hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing the country in packed trains, buses and planes this week to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives.  Health authorities in the central city of Wuhan, where a seafood market has been identified as the centre of the outbreak, said Tuesday that an 89-year-old man became the fourth person to die from the virus and that 15 medical staff had been infected.  A second case was also confirmed in Shanghai on Tuesday while five people have been diagnosed with the illness in Beijing.  The virus has also reached Japan, Thailand and South Korea, with a total of four people having been hospitalised after visiting Wuhan.  A man showing symptoms of the new disease who travelled to the Chinese city has been put in isolation in Australia as health officials await test results, public broadcaster ABC reported Tuesday.  Rare WHO meeting  Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s national health commission, confirmed that the virus was being transmitted between humans, state media reported late Monday.  The WHO had previously identified animals as the likely primary source, but had warned of Ã¢â‚¬Å“some limited human-to-human transmissionÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Zhong told CCTV that patients can contract the virus without having visited Wuhan.  He also said 14 medical staff had been infected but it was not clear if he was referring to the Wuhan cases.  In southern Guangdong province, two patients were infected by family members who visited Wuhan, he told CCTV.  The WHO said a key emergency committee would meet Wednesday to determine whether to declare an international public health emergency.  The agency has only used the rare label a handful of times, including during the H1N1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or swine flu Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016.  Fears spreading  The Chinese government announced Tuesday it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as the SARS outbreak, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel.  ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s President Xi Jinping said that the virus must be Ã¢â‚¬Å“resolutely containedÃ¢â‚¬Â and stressed that information must be released Ã¢â‚¬Å“in a timely mannerÃ¢â‚¬Â, in his first public comments on the outbreak on Monday.  The Communist government was accused of covering up the SARS outbreak in 2003 but some foreign experts have praised the swift release of information on the new virus.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The speed of response is testimony to improved global preparedness,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Jeremy Farrar, director of British healthcare foundation Wellcome Trust.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“But we must not be complacent, there is still much to be done to ensure countries across the world are protecting people from epidemic threats of diseases known and unknown,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Nearly 200 confirmed cases are in Wuhan, where the city announced it was enforcing stronger supervision of markets and public transportation hubs, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“encouraged the cancellationÃ¢â‚¬Â of unnecessary public gatherings.  The city has set up an epidemic prevention and control headquarters.  Special screening measures have been set up at airports in Australia, Singapore, the United States, and Thailand.  In Hong Kong, health officials said they were expanding enhanced checks on arrivals to include anyone coming in from Hubei province, not just its capital Wuhan.  Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the official figure.

Round the world, airports tightened screening of travellers from China as officials confirmed the coronavirus strain is contagious between humans.  The World Health Organization (WHO) called a meeting for Wednesday to consider declaring a global health emergency.  The outbreak, which began in the central city of Wuhan, also sent shivers through financial markets as investors recalled the fallout from ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002/2003 that it initially covered up.  The SARS coronavirus killed nearly 800 people then.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll stay at home during the holiday. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m scared as I remember SARS very well,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Zhang Xinyuan, who had been bound from Beijing for the Thai resort of Phuket before she and her husband decided to cancel their air tickets.  Authorities have confirmed more than 300 cases in China, mostly in Wuhan, a provincial capital and transportation hub, where the virus may have originated at a seafood market.  There have been six deaths in that city, Mayor Zhou Xianwang told Chinese state television on Tuesday.  The virus has been spreading around other parts of China, however, including five cases in the national capital Beijing. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected.  Abroad, Thailand has reported two cases and South Korea one, all involving Chinese travellers from Wuhan. Japan and Taiwan also confirmed one case each, both nationals who had been to Wuhan.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Information about newly reported infections suggest there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission,Ã¢â‚¬Â said WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regional director for the western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai.  Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, on Monday set up an epidemic response command centre. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further.  Though the origin of the virus was yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to WuhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seafood market.  The virus can cause pneumonia, with symptoms including fever and difficulty in breathing. As those symptoms are similar to many other respiratory diseases, extra screening is needed.  A woman wearing a mask walks along a street in Beijing, China January 21, 2020. REUTERS/Jason Lee  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus in Wuhan is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region now that there is medical evidence of human-to-human transmission,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific Chief Economist for IHS Markit.  So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions but such measures could be discussed at WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meeting.  ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National Health Commission will also give an update at a press briefing at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Wednesday.  RUSH FOR MASKS  Airports in the United States, Australia and across Asia have begun screening passengers from Wuhan.  In the city itself, officials have been using infrared thermometers to screen passengers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals since Jan. 14.  The Lunar New Year is a major holiday for Chinese, many of whom travel to join family or have a foreign holiday.  Images of long lines of people queuing to buy face masks were circulating widely on Chinese social media.

Shanghai cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s market regulator warned it would punish speculators hoarding masks or other products used for preventing diseases, according to the Shanghai Observer, a web publication backed by a Communist Party newspaper.  But Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health CommissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team investigating the outbreak, sought to ease alarm, saying in footage shown by state television there was no danger of a repeat of the SARS epidemic so long as precautions were taken.

3754327,rappler,None,Ã¢â‚¬ËœNovel coronavirusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or 2019 nCoV,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/rappler/~3/g6_x9mewzk8/249868-novel-coronavirus-what-we-know-so-far,,22/1/2020 1:18,"MANILA, Philippines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday, January 21, confirmed that it is investigating a case of Ã¢â‚¬Å“non-specific pancoronavirusÃ¢â‚¬Â found in a 5-year-old Chinese boy in Cebu City.  Health officials have ruled out MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS and SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS. This means that the samples from the child, which are currently being tested in Australia, could be one of the 5 other existing coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, including the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), which started in Wuhan, China and has infected over 200 people.  The World Health Organization (WHO) is set to hold an emergency meeting to discuss this novel virus that has since been found not just in China but in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea as well. The WHO said the mode of transmission for the virus is still being determined, though a Beijing government expert said it could be contagious between humans.  HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we know so far:  When did it start?  The first cases of nCoV were revealed by Chinese state media on December 31, after 44 people from the Chinese city of Wuhan were confirmed to be infected. Initial reports referred to the disease as Ã¢â‚¬Å“mystery viral pneumonia,Ã¢â‚¬Â as infected people exhibited flu-like symptoms like persistent coughing, fever, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing.  Where did it come from?  The infections started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, a city of 11 million. It is the capital of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hubei province and also serves as a major transport hub in the country. There are fears that the virus might spread as many people travel across the country during the Chinese New Year. Officials in Wuhan have put in place strict screening measures of people traveling out of the city, with medics even taking passengersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ temperatures before planes are allowed to fly out.  So far, cases have been confirmed in Shanghai and Beijing. The virus has also reached South Korea, Japan, and Thailand, with cases confirmed in people with history of travel to Wuhan.  Health officials in China have said that the virus probably originated in animals and was transmitted to humans by contact with animals at a live market, but such suspicion has yet to be confirmed. Chinese officials in China have also said that the virus can spread from person to person, but the WHO has yet to make a similar pronouncement.  How is it related to SARS and MERS?  The pneumonia-like disease caused by the 2019 nCoV is similar to SARS and MERS in that nCoV, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, is also a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that can cause a range of diseases in humans and animals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ diseases as simple as the common cold to diseases like MERS and SARS. (READ: What is coronavirus? New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears)  MERS is a viral respiratory disease that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. By the end of 2015, 483 deaths and a total of 1,180 cases were reported in the Middle East. MERS symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia may also be present, but not always.  Though it remains unknown where exactly the virus came from, health officials have said that the virus might have come from camels, which is common in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.  SARS is another viral respiratory disease which originated in Guangdong province, southern China in 2003. A SARS epidemic spread to 26 countries in 2003, resulting in a total of 8,000 cases and over 800 deaths in China and Hong Kong. Transmitted by human-to-human contact, it is characterized by the following flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, diarrhea, shivering, cry cough, and shortness of breath.  The virus is believed to have come from bats and spread to other animals. Unlike MERS that was found to infect mostly older men with chronic conditions, SARS was found to infect both health and unhealthy individuals.  It is not yet known whether the 2019 disease infecting over 200 in China is caused by a more severe kind of coronavirus like MERS and SARS, but the WHO has emphasized that 3 of the 4 who have died due to the new virus had pre-existing illnesses. Like MERS and SARS, though, the disease emerging from the 2019 nCoV cannot be treated through vaccination. Control of the disease is done through close monitoring, symptom management, and rest.  How severe is it?  The 5-year-old boy in which the 2019 nCoV was found is recovering, according to DOH. He remains under observation in a hospital in Cebu City, still experiencing cough but no longer feverish.  WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s country representative to the Philippines, Rabindra Abeyasinghe, said in a January 21 press briefing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“it is too early to say this is a severe disease.Ã¢â‚¬Â Abeyasinghe reiterated that the 3 people who have died due to the virus were proven to have pre-existing illnesses.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We still need to understand better the mode of transmission and what needs to be done specifically for management,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added. WHO recommends the use of tried and tested guidelines used for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are advocating following those same precautions until we have clearer information that will help us form more specific guidelines,Ã¢â‚¬Â Abeyasinghe added.  For now, DOH and WHO are reminding people to practice proper hygiene, as transmission may be from contacts with animals or other humans. They have also advised the public to practice frequent handwashing and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.  Proper cough etiquette is to be observed as well: maintaining distance and covering your nose and mouth with tissue, a towel, or the crook of your elbow. DOH and WHO are also calling on people to ensure that food is well-cooked while the potential source of the virus is still being identified.  What is the government doing?  The health departmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is on high alert, especially with travelers from Wuhan and China manifesting fever or signs of respiratory infection. The BOQ is set to meet with airlines to remind them of measures to observe in light of the scare. They will ensure that airlines have universal protective kits on board and remind them of protocols in handling cases on board and reporting cases to authorities on the ground.  DOH also said that health workers are also expected to be more vigilant when in contact with patients with acute respiratory infection, especially those with travel history to China.  Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the PhilippinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“detection capability is still evolving.Ã¢â‚¬Â The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), DOHÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main research arm for prevention and control of infectious and tropical diseases, has yet to determine whether the virus found in the 5-year-old boy in Cebu was MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV.  Duque said RITM would have to acquire samples of the new coronavirus from China to be able to test whether samples found here are indeed the same.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“WHO is in constant coordination with the Chinese health ministry as to when the available primer (DNA sample of nCoV that will serve as basis for determining other samples of nCoV) will be given to countries so it will serve as the basis for our own testing and treatment,Ã¢â‚¬Â Duque said.

They said a family of eight including six children was killed in the rural village of Kfar Taal west of government-controlled Aleppo, while another nine civilians were killed in Maardabseh in the southeast of Idlib province.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“God take revenge on all tyrants. There is no one else left in my family, they are all gone,Ã¢â‚¬Â Abu Yasser, 71, a relative of the family wiped out in Kfar Taal, said in a voice recording sent to Reuters.  At least 22 other civilians were killed in other strikes by Russian and Syrian government warplanes on rural opposition areas that have been hit hard since the Russian-led military campaign, supplemented by Iranian militias, began in December.  The aerial bombings in which Moscow has also deployed special forces on the ground to push deeper into rebel-held territory has left dozens of towns in ruins and knocked down hospitals and schools, rescuers and aid agencies say.  U.N. officials said last week a humanitarian crisis in the Idlib region of far northwestern Syria, the last significant rebel redoubt in Syria after almost nine years of civil war, had worsened with at least 350,000 civilians now on the run.  Another half a million people fled earlier bouts of fighting to the safety of camps near the border of Turkey, which backs some rebel factions in the northwest.  A ceasefire brokered between Turkey and Russia to end the latest offensive collapsed nearly 10 days ago when Moscow resumed heavy strikes on civilian areas in what residents said was a strategy of bringing the armed opposition to its knees by striking its popular base.  The latest offensive has brought President Bashar al-AssadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military campaign closer to heavily populated central areas of Idlib, where nearly 3 million people are trapped, according to aid charities and U.N. agencies.  Moscow and Damascus deny accusations of indiscriminate bombing of civilians, saying they are fighting jihadist militants who they say have stepped up their attacks on civilians in Aleppo city in northern Syria.  Syrian state television said two women and a child were killed in a rocket attack by Ã¢â‚¬Å“terroristsÃ¢â‚¬Â - its standard term for anti-Assad rebels - on a crowded neighbourhood of Aleppo.

Those living in the city have been advised not to leave, in a week when millions of Chinese are travelling for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.  The airport and train stations will be closed to outgoing passengers.  Bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance transport networks will shut down from 1000 local time on 23 January.  Those living in Wuhan had already been told to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings.  Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said it was a ""very strong measure"" that would ""not only control the outbreak, they will minimise spread internationally"".  Meanwhile, after a day of discussion the WHO's emergency committee has not yet decided whether to declare a ""global emergency"" over the virus. Talks will continue on Thursday.  The outbreak has killed 17 people, and there are more than 500 confirmed cases.  However, calculations by scientists at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggest there are 4,000 people sick with the virus in Wuhan.  Skip Twitter post by @MRC_Outbreak UPDATE: Report estimates 4000 cases #coronavirus #2019nCoV    Our estimate at 4,000 cases is more than double the past estimate due to increase of number of cases outside China.

There is also evidence of human to human transmission with the novel virus spreading to family members and healthcare workers.  But understanding how easily and how often the virus spread between people is one of the major outstanding questions in this outbreak.  Beyond Wuhan, it has spread to several Chinese provinces, the US, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.  Late on Wednesday, Chinese authorities confirmed the number of dead had almost doubled - from nine - in the space of a day. All fatalities so far have been in Hubei, the province around Wuhan.  Officials in Hong Kong also reported the territory's first two cases.  Known for now as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously been identified in humans. The Sars virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold.  A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola.  Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO said more time was needed to reach a decision. ""This is a complex and evolving situation,"" he said.  ""The decision about whether or not to declare public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence,"" he added.  Chinese officials said the country was now at the ""most critical stage"" of prevention and control.  ""Basically, do not go to Wuhan. And those in Wuhan please do not leave the city,"" said National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin in one of the first public briefings since the beginning of the outbreak.  The virus infects the lungs and symptoms start with a fever and cough. It can progress to shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.  The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities.  'Imagine shutting down London before Christmas'  By James Gallagher, BBC health and science correspondent  Wuhan is starting to look like a city in quarantine.  Officials had already warned residents not to leave the city and visitors not to come.  Now the reported public transport ban - which includes flights - slams many of the routes in and out of the city shut.

The previously unknown and contagious coronavirus strain emerged from the central city of Wuhan, with cases now detected as far away as the United States. Officials believe the origin to be a market where wildlife is traded illegally.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, had risen to 17 late on Wednesday, state television quoted the provincial government as saying.    Hours earlier, officials had put the toll at nine dead, all in Wuhan, and more than 470 cases confirmed in China.  Contrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people, China has this time given regular updates to try to head off panic as millions travel at home and abroad for the Chinese New Year.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ""The rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading,"" National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin said.  The World Health Organization (WHO) began an emergency meeting to rule if the outbreak was a global health emergency.  After official appeals to stay calm, many Chinese were cancelling trips, buying face masks, avoiding public places such as cinemas and shopping centres, and even turning to an online plague simulation game or watching disaster movie The Flu as a way to cope.  ""The best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,"" said one commentator on China's Twitter-like Weibo.  The virus has spread from Wuhan around China to population centres including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong.  Abroad, Thailand has confirmed four cases, while the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one.  President Donald Trump said the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a good containment plan. ""We think it is going to be handled very well,"" he said at Davos in Switzerland.  RESPIRATORY THREAT  Li said the virus, which can cause pneumonia, was being spread via breathing. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. About 2,200 people in contact with infected people were in isolation.  There is no vaccine for the virus.

Because there's no cure for the virus,"" said Fu Ning, a 36-year-old woman in Beijing. ""You have to rely on your immunity if you get an infection. It sounds very scary.""  Fears of a pandemic initially spooked markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit and the yuan falling, but they were regaining their footing on Wednesday in approval of China's containment response.  Across China, companies from Foxconn to Huawei Technologies and HSBC Holdings were warning staff to avoid Wuhan and handing out masks. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said he was advising employees not to visit China.    With more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China's main industrial and commercial centre and an important transport hub, home to the country's largest inland port and gateway to its giant Three Gorges hydroelectric dam.  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases would appear as China stepped up monitoring. But Li said there was no evidence of ""super-spreaders"" capable of disseminating the virus more widely, as happened during the SARS outbreak. SARS was thought to have crossed to humans from civet cats sold for food.  GLOBAL PRECAUTIONS  Airports round the world have stepped up screening of people from China.  Russia's consumer safety watchdog said it had strengthened its sanitary and quarantine control, Britain said it would start enhanced monitoring of passengers arriving from Wuhan and Singapore started screening all passengers arriving from China.  The Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed its first case of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus and tightened body-temperature screening measures.

North Korea banned foreign tourists from Wednesday due to the virus, several foreign tour operators said, losing one of its main sources of foreign currency.  Sport too was affected, with some qualifying boxing matches for the 2020 Olympics set for Wuhan cancelled and women's football qualifiers shifted to Nanjing.

The new strain of the virus has so far killed 18 people in China and there are more than 500 confirmed cases.  A Scottish government spokeswoman confirmed that two people diagnosed with flu were now being tested for the virus. Three others are also being tested on a precautionary basis.  At least three of the patients are believed to be Chinese nationals.  Prof Juergen Haas, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh, earlier said three suspected cases were in Edinburgh. There had also been thought to be a fourth case in Glasgow.  All those being treated in Scotland have respiratory symptoms and have been in Wuhan, thought to be the source of the outbreak, in the last 14 days.  Wuhan has gone into lockdown, along with other areas across the Hubei province.  It is not yet known which hospitals are treating the patients, one of which is an Edinburgh student.  Samples are being sent in category A transport to a laboratory in London for urgent testing.  The Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""There are currently no confirmed cases of Coronavirus (WN Co-V) in the UK and the risk to the Scottish public remains low.  ""We are co-orientating with Health Protection Scotland a daily incident management team to continue to monitor the situation as it develops, including on the number of any potential cases going forward.""  Image caption Prof Juergen Haas said it was ""very likely"" that there would be confirmed cases in the UK  Prof Haas, head of infection medicine at Edinburgh University, said it was ""very likely"" that cases would be confirmed in the UK.  ""In any European countries there is a danger that these cases occur,"" he said. ""Here at the University of Edinburgh we have more than 2,000 students from China and they are always coming and going back to China so we are relatively sure we will have cases in the UK from travellers coming back from China.""  He warned that the spread of the virus might increase as more people travelled around for Chinese New Year, within China and to other countries.  Any suspected cases have to be isolated and staff dealing with them must wear protective clothes including gloves, masks and goggles.  Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are particularly at risk.  Dundee University has a joint education partnership with Wuhan University, where students from Wuhan complete the final year of their architecture degree at Dundee. Many opt to remain at Dundee for a further year to obtain their Masters qualification.  The university said there were currently 34 students from the programme in Dundee, having arrived in September 2019 and said five members of staff had returned from a visit to Wuhan last week.  No health concerns have been raised.  ""We will continue to monitor the situation taking advice from the relevant agencies as to appropriate action,"" the spokesman said.  The university has also advised students to be careful if receiving packages from areas where the virus is present, especially if they contain food items.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption A total of 500 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed  Other Scottish universities have given general advice to students travelling to China and said anyone who has been in China, or other areas where incidents of infection have been reported, within the last 14 days, and is experiencing respiratory symptoms, to contact their GP or NHS 24.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was questioned about the risk to people in Scotland at First Minister's Questions at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday.

The Ministry of Health on Thursday announced that the first confirmed Wuhan virus case in Singapore was a 66-year-old Chinese man.  The Wuhan resident, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20, flew from Guangzhou. He is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition.    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Science has made a lot of progress since SARS, so this time with a new coronavirus, the scientists have been able to identify and sequence it much faster than happened with SARS and share the information with other countries in a much more expeditious way,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mr Lee.

The march called by Moqtada al-Sadr aims to pressure Washington to pull out its troops, but many anti-government protesters fear it could overshadow their separate, months-long demonstrations that have challenged Iran-backed Shi'ite groups' grip on power.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Sadr opposes all foreign interference in Iraq but has recently aligned himself more closely with Iran, whose allies have dominated state institutions since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.  Throngs of marchers started gathering early on Friday at al-Hurriya Square in central Baghdad and near around the city's main university, Reuters witnesses said. Marchers avoided Tahrir square, symbol of mass protests against Iraq' ruling elites.  ""We want them all out - America, Israel, and the corrupt politicians in government,"" said Raed Abu Zahra, a health ministry worker from southern city of Samawa, who arrived by bus at night and stayed in Sadr City, a sprawling district of Baghdad controlled by the cleric's followers.  ""We support the protests in Tahrir as well, but understand why Sadr held this protest here so it doesn't take attention from theirs,"" he added.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Men and women marched waving the red, white and black national colours, and chanted slogans against the United States, which leads a military coalition against the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.  ""DO NOT CROSS THIS BARRIER""  Some were wearing symbolic white robes indicating they're willing to die for their country while others sat looking out over the square from half-finished buildings, holding signs reading ""No, no, America, no, no, Israel, no, no, colonialists"".  Marchers were protected by Sadr's Saraya al-Salam brigades and Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella grouping of Iran-backed Shi'ite militias, witnesses said.  It is unclear if the march will end up at the gates of the US Embassy, the seat of US power in Iraq and the scene of violent clashes last month when militia supporters tried to storm the compound.  Main roads in Baghdad were barricaded by security forces and the city's Green Zone, which houses foreign missions, were blocked off with concrete barriers. Outside the US embassy, a sign reads ""Warning. Do not cross this barrier, we will use pre-emptive measures against any attempt to cross"".  The US killing of Iranian military mastermind General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad this month has raised the spectre of more civil strife in a country torn by years of sectarian conflict.

Sadr, head of Sairoon, the largest coalition bloc in parliament, has capitalised on rising regional tensions, which soared after the United States assassinated Iranian military general Qassem Soleimani on Iraqi soil.  More:  The January 3 US military drone strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi commander of the pro-Iranian Hashd al-Shabi militias (PMF).  As calls for an end to interference grew louder, the Iraqi parliament on January 5 backed a non-binding resolution for all foreign troops - including 5,200 US soldiers - to leave the country.  Those calls were renewed at Friday's rally at Jadriya, a neighbourhood where politicians live and work.  ""Today's protest is a referendum called for by the Iraqi people who consider the presence of US forces within the country a danger to them and to the region,"" civil servant Asad al-Hashemi told Al Jazeera.  ""The US is the reason for the corruption and all of our misfortunes.""  He said the American presence stokes dissent and increases the liklihood of people ""acting out against it on our terrain, thus turning Iraq into an ongoing battlefield for competing geo-political interests.  ""We want to reclaim our sovereignty back.""  A soldier stands in a building overlooking the protest in Jadriya neighbourhood [Emma Francis/Al Jazeera]  On Wednesday, Iraqi President Barham Saleh met US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The two leaders agreed on the need to keep US forces in Iraq, much to the consternation of the pro-Sadr protesters.  Mohammed Jasim al-Kinani, 55, one of the leaders of the southern Kinani tribe, called the Salih-Trump meeting ""unacceptable"".  ""The people should take it upon themselves to follow through the parliament's vote of expelling US forces from Iraq,"" he said.  'Get rid of US forces'  The number of demonstrators suggested tens of thousands rather than a million, but their demands of an end to foreign interference - with particular emphasis on the US withdrawal - were vociferous nonetheless.  Mariam, an 18-year-old high school student, attended the protest with her mother and sisters.  ""I'm here today to protest against the United States occupying our lands,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""We want to liberate our country from these chains of oppression. We've been suppressed and hurt by the US's own interests in the region so we want them out of Iraq.""  Tribal leader Mohammed Jasim al-Kinani, right, said the Trump-Salih meeting on Friday where both leaders agreed to keep American soldiers in the country was 'unacceptable' [Emma Francis/Al Jazeera]  In addition to the sea of Iraqi flags, many protesters, young and old, had plain white flags tied around their shoulders - a tribute to Sadr's late father, the Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr.  The elder Sadr was known to wear a white cloth which symbolised a shroud, representing that he was ready for death whenever.  Thabet al-Yasiri, who is unemployed, travelled from Samawa, a southern city, to attend.  ""This is my first time protesting since the anti-government demonstrations began last October,"" he said. ""First we have to get rid of the US forces, then we should focus on tackling government corruption and reforms.""  Ranging protest movements  Meanwhile, a separate and large anti-government protest movement centred in Tahrir Square has gripped the capital and the Shia-majority south for almost four months, with Iraqis demanding complete overhaul of the political landscape, early elections and more accountability.  At least 500 protesters have been killed, and while Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi stepped down, he continues to act in a caretaker capacity.  On Friday, protesters in Tahrir Square derided Sadr's march as a show of support for the government.  ""The Sadr current want an end to foreign interference by the same system we are protesting against,"" protester Ali Adnan said, speaking from the barricaded Jumhuriyyeh Bridge just off Tahrir Square.  The 23-year-old, who is from the southern city of Basra, said the October protest movement is different because it is ""youth-led"" and not called for by a specific political party.  ""We want a democratic, sovereign, national and transparent government- that's all. We're sick of these parties and the muhasasa system,"" Adnan said.  But several people in Jadriya expressed said that the two movements overlap.  ""Today's protest in Jadriya is calling for one of the same demands as the anti-government movement, which is an end to foreign interference and corruption,"" Sheikh Hussein Karbalai, a cleric from Karbala, told Al Jazeera.  ""We believe the US is the source of the corruption in this country and that's one of the reasons they must get out of our affairs.""",en,terrorattack,907,['US']

The march has rattled the separate, months-old protest movement that has gripped the capital and the Shiite-majority south since October, demanding a government overhaul, early elections and more accountability.  In the early hours of Friday, thousands of men, women and children of all ages massed under grey skies in the Jadiriyah district of east Baghdad.  ""Get out, get out, occupier!"" some shouted, while others chanted, ""Yes to sovereignty!""  The American military presence has been a hot-button issue in Iraq since a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside Baghdad airport on January 3.  Two days later, parliament voted for all foreign troops Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including some 5,200 US personnel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to leave the country.  The vote was non-binding and a senior US official sad Thursday that Washington had yet to open talks with Baghdad on a troop pullout.  ""There has not been any real engagement,"" said ambassador James Jeffrey, the US special envoy for Syria and the coalition against the Islamic State group.  But he added that operations against the jihadists had been on hold since the drone strike, which triggered retaliatory Iranian missile strikes targeting US troops in Iraq.  ""Coalition operations have been primarily on pause in Iraq as we focus on force protection and looking into the way forward with the Iraqi government,"" Jeffrey said.  Long opposed to the US troop presence, Sadr seized on the public anger over the drone strike to call ""a million-strong, peaceful, unified demonstration to condemn the American presence and its violations"".  Several pro-Iran factions from the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, usually rivals of Sadr, have backed his call and pledged to join.  Preparations were in full swing as early as noon on Thursday, with additional checkpoints across Baghdad to secure the protest area and buses ferrying in people for the rally.  'Politicised' protests  But separate anti-government protesters, who have braved violence that has left 470 people dead since October, fear their cause could be eclipsed by Sadr's powerplay.  ""Sadr doesn't represent us,"" one teenager said defiantly late Thursday on a blocked-off thoroughfare in Baghdad.  To head off Friday's gathering and ramp up pressure on authorities to enact reforms, young demonstrators blocked streets in Baghdad and across the south this week.  When Sadr announced the rally last week, many feared he would hold it near Tahrir (Liberation) Square Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the main focus of the long-running protests.  But his spokesman Saleh al-Obeidy said late Wednesday that they had chosen Jadiriyah, near Baghdad University, as the gathering place.  That, in turn, has sparked worry that angry crowds could attack the presidential palace or the high-security Green Zone, home to the US embassy and other foreign missions.  The move would not be without precedent for Sadr, who urged followers to storm the Green Zone in 2016 in a challenge to the government over undelivered reforms.  Sadr battled US forces at the head of his Mehdi Army militia after the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.  He later branded himself a reformist and backed the recent anti-government protests when they erupted in October.  The firebrand cleric controls parliament's largest bloc and his followers hold top ministerial positions.  The 46-year-old is a notoriously fickle politician, known for switching alliances quickly.  ""Some sides representing the October revolutionaries think Iran is solely responsible for Iraq's ruin and others represented by the Hashed or its supporters say America is the source of ruin,"" Obeidy said Wednesday.  ""We believe that both are behind this ruin, and Sadr is trying to balance between the two.""  Hedging bets  Harith Hasan of the Carnegie Middle East Center said Sadr was trying to sustain his ""multiple identities"" by backing various protests.  ""On the one hand, (he seeks to) position himself as the leader of a reform movement, as a populist, as anti-establishment,"" Hasan told AFP.  ""On the other hand, he also wants to sustain his image as the leader of the resistance to the 'American occupation',"" partly to win favour with Iran.  Sadr may also have domestic motivations, Hasan said.  ""This protest will show Sadr is still the one able to mobilize large groups of people in the streets -- but it's also possible he wants other groups to respond by giving him more space to choose the prime minister.""

It can lead to pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.  The World Health Organisation on Thursday declared the virus an ""emergency in China"", but stopped short of declaring it a global health emergency.

This is a rare, nonpartisan issue our divisive political climate. President Trump ran on this concept in 2016, and the 2020 Democratic field of candidates vying to take on Trump is echoing the sentiment as well.  When the campaign rhetoric fades, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ending the endless warsÃ¢â‚¬Â is hard to form into coherent foreign policy. No serious president can afford to walk away from the Middle East without exposing us to the threat of terrorism or of losing the strategic fight to regional competitors such as Iran or near-peer competitors such as Russia and China.  The national security establishment presents the complex issues in the Middle East as a binary choice. They suggest we must either fight until we secure a victory they cannot define, or that we must pull everyone out and retreat from the world.  KENT INGLE: IRAN CONFLICT ILLUSTRATES WHY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT. WAR POWERS RESOLUTION TIES TRUMP'S HANDS  This is a false choice. We have other options. To understand our options we must accept that we have failed in our post-9/11 wars.  We have failed because we refuse to accept that war and international power have changed. If wars could still be won by a decisive military victory against a foe able to accept the terms of surrender, the U.S. would have no rivals. We would experience victory whenever we chose to use our military might.  The main reason we have failed in our post-9/11 wars is our inability to define a clear mission. What is the goal of the War on Terror?  For proof of our failures, look no further than our most infamous post-9/11 wars. Afghanistan just had its most lethal year for U.S. troops since 2014. To add insult to travesty, the release of the ""Afghanistan Papers"" closed out 2019, exposing lies that attempted to cover up nearly two decades of failure.  Iraq, despite years of experts claiming that the government we installed was a stable partner, teeters from disaster to disaster. Iraq has been our most costly and controversial chapter in the War on Terror, and it now threatens to ignite a new conflict with Iran.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER  Our terrorist enemies elude defeat by abstaining from decisive engagement in battle, rendering our tactical victories meaningless in the long run. Our strategic rivals, Russia and China, thrive when we are over-extended in wars that we have no hope of ending. Our conflicts also keep us busy in non-strategic areas while Russia and China strategically maneuver abroad and conduct information and economic warfare against our homeland. Our strategic rivals win when we expend resources with no return on our investment.  The main reason we have failed in our post-9/11 wars is our inability to define a clear mission. What is the goal of the War on Terror? Immediately after 9/11, we set out to destroy Al Qaeda. But within a few months, we completely deviated from that clear objective and began nation-building, first in Afghanistan, and then in Iraq. We have not recovered since.  We fight terror to eliminate those who seek to attack our homeland. The ability to locate and kill these terrorists does not require the U.S. to expend resources toppling, propping up or building nations. The myth of Ã¢â‚¬Å“fighting them over there so we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to fight them hereÃ¢â‚¬Â is not supported by data. Most of our casualties in the War on Terror have not been inflicted by terrorists or insurgents who possess the intent and capability to attack us outside their countries. Most of the enemies we are fighting in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan are fighting for local or regional goals.  The majority of post-9/11 attack plans against the homeland emanated from Yemen and Pakistan and were thwarted by our intelligence and law enforcement efforts, not due to an enduring military presence on the ground.  Our goals in the region are to ensure that bad people do not physically hold enough ground to dedicate time and resources to launching attacks against us. We also need to contain Iranian aggression and prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Additionally, we must check Russian encroachment and limit their influence on allies such as Turkey, which would threaten our European allies.  To accomplish these goals we must be judicious with our power and only extend force when and where we must. Luckily, many of our goals are complementary. Our first goal, protecting our homeland from an attack by the Islamic State or Al Qaeda, complements our need to push back on Iranian expansion.  ISIS is an existential threat to Iran and its allies, they are fighting over the same terrain for different objectives, their continued non decisive conflict is in our interest. We can prolong their fight by limiting our strikes against either side and maintaining clandestine ties with members of both sides. Both sides will be highly motivated for funding, air support and weapons. We can exploit their immediate tactical needs for our strategic gain.  The fight between our radical Islamist enemies will be brutal. We must limit our risk by removing the vast majority of our troops, especially those operating in an overt capacity, from their reach. Our bases, patrols and meaningless engagements with the locals only serve as opportunities to attack us. We can launch any limited military operations we need from neighboring countries.  Simultaneously, we must sanction Iran, Iraq and Syria to limit IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reach. IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inability to fund their proxies will limit their influence on the region and allow us to have more influence on cash strapped militias.  Allowing the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Iran to fight also complements our strategy of limiting Russian expansion in the region. Russia is committed to ensuring port access in Syria and is seeking influence with Turkey. This places Russia in the center of our enemies, attempting to appease all sides and prime for military and economic over-extension.  If we remain spread across the region, our enemies retain the ability to strike us. If we remove ourselves, we take that option off the table, and we are free to use our economic power and intelligence services to achieve our goals.  We can exert additional pressure on Iran and Russia by ending our futile efforts in Afghanistan. The result will look the same whether we leave tomorrow or in another 18 years. The Taliban will return. The only thing we need from Afghanistan is to ensure it is not used as a staging ground for terrorism.  We can accomplish this through a combination of extending our covert drone war from Pakistan and by paying off key members of the Taliban to give up foreign terrorists for financial gain. Simply put, we offer them the chance to get rich or get bombed. The Taliban may also be used to destabilize IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eastern border, allowing our rivals to fight each other.

The country's most important celebration has been all-but cancelled for people in a dozen cities who have been ordered to hunker down.  On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves.  China has launched a massive quarantine effort across much of Hubei province, affecting more than 40 million people.

The nationwide death toll has now jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan.  Confirmed cases of infection nationwide also surged, to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei.  In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said.  The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, January 24, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola, and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals.  Protect yourself  ""Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,"" said a man in a surgical mask at a store where customers were stocking up on protective gear.  But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities.  ""The government is in control of this. It's not a problem.""  The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and spread to a number of other countries. (READ: What we learned from SARS, according to ex-DOH chief Manuel Dayrit)  It has now been reported nationwide and in a dozen other countries, with France on Friday saying 3 cases had been confirmed there Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the first known infections in Europe.  Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections.  Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed until the coast is clear.  ""Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,"" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native.  ""It'll be great just to be able to make it through [the outbreak].""  Trump praise  China's aggressive response has won praise internationally, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of a sluggish response and stonewalling the international community.  ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" United States President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the US confirmed its second case.  ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,"" he added.  ""It will all work out well.""  China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus.

The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down anyway during the week-long break.  The outbreak emerged in late December and has been traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat.  The World Health Organization on Thursday, January 23, stopped short of declaring a global health emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions.  Wuhan, however, now resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits.  Wuhan's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth.  But police manning a roadblock on the way to the site on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the spread of the virus.  The scale of the crisis has prompted authorities to start construction on a new field hospital in Wuhan to deal with the outbreak, which state media said could be ready in 10 days.

People wear face masks as they select products in a supermarket in Beijing as China is hit by an outbreak of the new coronavirus, January 25, 2020. REUTERS/Thomas Peter  Whether the outbreak will continue to spread at this rate depends on the effectiveness of control measures, the scientists who conducted the studies said. But to be able to contain the epidemic and turn the tide of infections, control measures would have to halt transmission in at least 60% of cases.  The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 41 on Saturday, with more than 1,400 people infected worldwide - the vast majority in China.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London who co-led one of the studies.  FergusonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team suggest as many as 4,000 people in Wuhan were already infected by Jan. 18 and that on average each case was infecting two or three others.  A second study by researchers at BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lancaster University also calculated the contagion rate at 2.5 new people on average being infected by each person already infected.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict (it) will be substantially larger by Feb. 4,Ã¢â‚¬Â the scientists wrote.  They estimated that the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the outbreak began in December will alone have around 190,000 cases of infection by Feb. 4., and that Ã¢â‚¬Å“infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at the Kirby Institute, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said on Saturday that it is highly concerning that in recent days the infection has become widespread.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The more widespread the infection in other parts of the China, the greater the risk of more global spread,Ã¢â‚¬Â MacIntyre said.  Australia, a popular destination for Chinese visitors, confirmed its first four cases of the virus in travellers from China, all of whom had been to Wuhan.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“What we need is more data to be published on risk factors, transmission, incubation period and epidemiology, so we can understand what control measures are most appropriate,Ã¢â‚¬Â MacIntyre said.

The UN health body said in a situation report published late Sunday that the risk was Ã¢â‚¬Å“very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In a footnote, the WHO said there had been an Ã¢â‚¬Å“errorÃ¢â‚¬Â in previous communications published on Thursday, Friday and Saturday which Ã¢â‚¬Å“incorrectlyÃ¢â‚¬Â said the global risk was Ã¢â‚¬Å“moderateÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Asked for more detail, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said only that it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“an error in the wordingÃ¢â‚¬Â.  The WHO on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus an international public health emergency Ã¢â‚¬â€ a rare designation used only for the most severe outbreaks that could trigger more concerted international action.  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is visiting China this week to discuss further action to contain the virus, on Thursday said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergencyÃ¢â‚¬Â.  WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cautious approach can be seen in the context of past criticism over its slow or too hasty use of the term, first used for the deadly 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.  During that outbreak, the UN health agency was criticised for sparking panic-buying of vaccines with its announcement that year that the outbreak had reached pandemic proportions, and then anger when it turned out the virus was not nearly as dangerous as first thought.  But then in 2014, the WHO met harsh criticism for dragging its feet and downplaying the severity of the Ebola epidemic that ravaged three west Africa countries, claiming more than 11,300 lives by the time it ended in 2016.

""All the sequences we've extracted are similar to the one that China initially posted a couple of weeks ago,"" she said.  All passengers arriving from Wuhan are currently subject to testing in 20 US airports, but since China has suspended all flights out of the stricken city, there are fewer and fewer travellers from there arriving in the US.  The virus has also reached other Chinese provinces and China has announced that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties.  That has rendered redundant the current measures to contain the virus in the US.  ""I expect that in the coming days, our travel recommendations will change,"" said Dr Messonnier.

The virus, named as 2019-nCoV, was first detected in December and has infected more than 4,500 people globally and killed 106.  More:  All deaths so far have been in China, with most around the southern city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.  So far, only four cases of the coronavirus have been detected in Europe, three in France and one in Germany.

""So we know a lot about how this type of infection spreads. We've got experience in managing it so that the patients are more likely to survive and also less likely to infect others, especially healthcare workers, nurses and doctors.""  SARS, another flu-like virus which also originated in China, infected almost 8,000 people across 17 countries in late 2002 and early 2003, killing nearly 800 people.  The spread was largely confined to Asia, with only 34 cases confirmed in Europe.  MERS was deadlier but did not have a global outbreak.  While with SARS and MERS, carriers showed symptoms, reports suggest that the new coronavirus can be passed on by people who have not yet shown signs of infection, complicating efforts to limit the spread of the disease.  We've completed one clinical trial with a MERS vaccine and we have started the second one in Saudi Arabia, and so we're using that technology to make a novel coronavirus vaccine. Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University  The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the global risk of the new virus as high but stopped short of designating it a public health emergency of international concern, a term reserved for only the most severe outbreaks.  ""If the virus comes to Europe and spreads, we need to trace the carriers, we need to test them and if they are positive they need to be quarantined. So in that case, we need rapid diagnostic tests,"" said Herman Goossens, director of the Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics (PREPARE), an EU-funded network that supports clinical research to address the outbreak of infectious diseases.  PREPARE works with more than 1,000 hospitals and labs across 42 European countries to ensure clinical trials for new diseases are rolled out quickly, so countries can begin to detect and treat patients with speed.  It is currently circulating standardised case report forms to gather case information and assisting diagnostic labs with developing tests for the coronavirus.  ""What we are doing now is to devise the protocol, prepare the hospitals, prepare the contracts and get ethical approval Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and then we would start the trial immediately as the number of cases are increasing Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ it depends on the number of cases in Europe,"" Goossens told Al Jazeera.  Early signs of this outbreak suggest it will not be as dangerous as SARS, according to Goossens, who said the current two to three percent mortality rate would drop as more, previously-unreported cases emerge.  ""There are a lot of cases outside of hospitals that are not in the statistics,"" he said. ""So I think that's where mortality will be below one percent. It will be much, much less violent or aggressive than the SARS virus.""  Chinese researchers published the 2019-nCoV sequence on a public database earlier this month, launching an immediate race to develop a vaccine.  ""[Unlike with Ebola in 2014,] nobody's got a vaccine ready to test against novel coronavirus because we've never seen it before,"" Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University, told Al Jazeera.  ""It's going to be a minimum of three months before anybody is ready to start doing the first clinical testing.""  Vaccines typically take so long to develop that epidemics have mostly subsided before they are widely available, but that may begin to change with the use of vaccine platforms.  This new technology allows immunologists to develop new vaccines from older, proven models, rather than starting from scratch each time.  Experts can now react much quicker to outbreaks of infectious diseases, said Gilbert, whose own lab has already started research using this approach.  ""We've completed one clinical trial with a MERS vaccine and we have started the second one in Saudi Arabia, and so we're using that technology to make a novel coronavirus vaccine.  ""Because we got good immunogenicity results, good strong immune responses in our MERS vaccine trial, we would expect to do the same again with the novel coronavirus.""  These advances in medical technology could produce a vaccine in a fraction of the time older methods require - sometimes up to 10 years - but would still require a minimum of one year before it could be used on a large scale, meaning public health approaches focused on detection and containment will remain vital until then.  ""It's going to take months to contain the outbreak initially, and we may then see small clusters of cases coming up in various different places,"" said Gilbert.

The US government is keen to place its own teams on the ground to review the raw data and learn more about the pathogen, which has so far claimed more than 100 lives.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have already started at the NIH and with many of our collaborators on the developing of a vaccine,Ã¢â‚¬Â National Institutes of Health (NIH) official Anthony Fauci told reporters.  The process would take three months to start the first trial, three more months to gather data, before being able to move into its second phase, and is being undertaken by the biotech firm Moderna.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“But we are proceeding as if we will have to deploy a vaccine,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Fauci.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“In other words, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking at the worst scenario that this becomes a bigger outbreak.Ã¢â‚¬Â  China was severely criticised for its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-03, which claimed hundreds of lives, mostly on the mainland and in Hong Kong.  During that health emergency, scientists had begun to develop a vaccine, but it was never deployed, Fauci said.  Separately, the chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson told AFP that his company was also developing a vaccine.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will utilise the same technology that was used in the development and manufacture of Johnson & JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ebola vaccine which is currently deployed in DRC and Rwanda,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Paul Stofells.  It is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the same technology was also used to construct our Zika and HIV vaccine candidates.Ã¢â‚¬Â  US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has offered China assistance three times in dealing with the crisis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so far without success.  This would be necessary so that Ã¢â‚¬Å“we can see raw data, raw evidence and help design the types of studies and analyticsÃ¢â‚¬Â to answer critical questions such as incubation period and whether the infection can be transmitted while patients donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have symptoms.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are urging China Ã¢â‚¬â€œ more cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response,Ã¢â‚¬Â Azar told reporters.  But the World Health Organisation announced later Tuesday that China had agreed to allow a team of international experts into the country to work with their Chinese counterparts.  China was quick to sequence the genome of the 2019 novel coronavirus and make it public, allowing scientists around the world to develop diagnostic tools and winning praise for its efforts, in contrast to the SARS outbreak.

Scientists in mainland China and the United States were also separately racing to produce a vaccine for the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people and infected thousands.  Yuen, chair of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, revealed that his team was working on the vaccine and had isolated the previously unknown virus from the city's first imported case.  ""We have already produced the vaccine, but it will take a long time to test on animals,"" Yuen said, without giving a specific time frame on when it would be ready for patients.  Professor Yuen Kwok-yung did not give a time frame on when the vaccine would be ready. PHOTO: South China Morning Post  But he said it would take months to test the vaccine on animals and at least another year to conduct clinical trials on humans before it was fit for use.  HKU researchers based it on a nasal spray influenza vaccine previously invented by Yuen's team.  Researchers modified the flu vaccine with part of the surface antigen of the coronavirus, meaning it could prevent influenza viruses as well as the new coronavirus, which causes pneumonia.  The vaccine, if successfully tested, could be the answer to a disease that has infected more than 4,600 people globally and killed over 100 on the mainland, mostly in Wuhan, centre of the outbreak.  Hong Kong had so far seen eight confirmed cases. From noon on Monday to noon on Tuesday, 78 more people were reported as suspected cases. Currently, 103 people are in isolation in public hospitals.  Although mainland media quoted Chinese infectious diseases expert Li Lanjuan on Monday as saying a vaccine targeting the coronavirus was being developed and could be made in around a month at the earliest, Yuen expressed doubts.  He said the one being developed on the mainland is likely to be an inactivated virus vaccine, which consists of a virus grown in a culture that has had its infectivity destroyed by chemicals or radiation.  To test the vaccine, it will have to be injected into an animal to see if it produces a good immune response, Yuen said. The vaccinated animal would then be exposed to the virus to see if is protected.",en,diseas,,

The US, which so far has five confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, has urged Americans to reconsider or postpone travel plans to China because of the outbreak. It also warned specifically against travel to the Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak in China with thousands of cases.  Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said during a news conference that he had offered to send a team of US infectious disease experts to China to assist with its public health efforts and that more cooperation and transparency would help make the response more effective.  ""Beyond that, all options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions,"" he said.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday that China had agreed to it sending international experts ""as soon as possible"". It was not clear when the WHO delegation would head to China and what countries would participate in the mission.  The US is seeking on-the-ground access to study health data that might confirm if the virus can spread before people have symptoms such as a fever, and to help with China's disease containment measures, said Mr Azar and other US health officials during the news conference.  Despite its fast spread, Mr Azar said risks of the disease are unclear, as the US is still learning about its severity, incubation period and whether there is a real danger of it being transmitted by people without symptoms.  There was no evidence of person-to-person transmission in the US, he said, adding that it was not necessary for Americans to wear surgical masks in public places.  He did not say what specific travel restrictions are being considered. The US is expanding screenings of travellers from China and has centres monitoring their health at 20 airports, up from five.

All the patients had recently returned from Wuhan, China, where the virus originated. More than 6,000 people have been infected in China, officials say, with more than 130 deaths worldwide.  More:  While the three patients in Canada are in isolation and officials say the risk remains low, Canada's approach to addressing the mysterious coronavirus has been driven by the lessons learned during the SARS outbreak more than 16 years ago.  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was another respiratory coronavirus that originated in China, infecting more than 8,000 people worldwide and killing more than 900.  Outside of Asia, Canada was hit the hardest by SARS, accounting for 438 suspected cases and 44 deaths. The virus was an unprecedented challenge to modern healthcare systems, especially in Toronto where the cases were concentrated.  Nearly 17 years later, experts say Canadian healthcare workers are better trained, global communication has improved, more efficient plans are in place for outbreaks and there has been a ""revolution"" in virus detection - although testing is still far from instantaneous.  Virus detection  Following the SARS outbreak, Canada established a committee to assess how the system responded to the illnesses and suggest improvements. Its report, Learning From SARS, found one of the biggest challenges was that SARS resembled many other respiratory infections, and there was no reliable lab test for the virus, so it was, therefore, hard to diagnose.  The toll it took on healthcare workers was especially devastating; 100 were infected and three died. They worked under intense pressure and fear of contracting the new and deadly virus.  While working to contain SARS in Toronto in 2003, Dr Allison McGeer contracted the virus, and survived. She said the key difference between the 2019 novel coronavirus and SARS is the ability to test patients.  ""When SARS first started arriving, we had no capacity to know whether somebody had SARS or something else because there was no diagnostic test for it, so everyone had to be treated as if they might have SARS,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""And that, of course, is much more difficult - it's an enormous load on the system. Now, you come in, we think you might have SARS, you get a test, we find out.""  A directions sign is seen at Sunnybrook Hospital, where a patient is being treated in isolation for what Canadian health officials call the first presumptive confirmed case of novel coronavirus, in Toronto, Ontario [Carlos Osorio/Reuters]  The science of detecting and sequencing viruses has vastly improved since SARS, McGeer said. On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) became aware of several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan that did not match other known viruses. On January 7, Chinese authorities confirmed to WHO that they had a new coronavirus, which has temporarily been named 2019-nCoV. Chinese health officials published the genetic sequence of the virus online, allowing other health agencies to develop diagnostic tests.  ""In the last 17 years, there's been a revolution in viral diagnostics, and so the concept that you could identify a virus and have it sequenced and post the sequence in a week 15 years ago was completely out of the question,"" McGeer said.  ""It's this really rapid evolution of the ability to sequence DNA and RNA and the development of pipelines to put those sequences together and make sense of them,"" she added. ""So, a big piece of it is just straight technology, but the second piece is about sharing information.""  Communication  Another major issue during the SARS outbreak was the sharing of basic information.  The virus now known as SARS broke out in China in November 2002, but Chinese officials did not report it to WHO until February 2003, actively covering up its spread.  With the novel coronavirus, Chinese officials initially said the virus was under control, leading to accusations that China was slow to act. Wuhan police arrested eight people for spreading ""falsehoods"" about the virus online, and detained journalists reporting on the outbreak. But on January 19, a Communist Party newspaper warned against concealing cases, and the next day a Chinese health official stated on a CCTV news programme that people should avoid Wuhan. After that, it appears China became more transparent about the threat, and Chinese scientists made their research public.  During SARS, Canada's provincial and federal governments were not great at sharing information, either, according to the 2003 review. Ontario's infectious disease software was ""an archaic DOS platform used in the late '80s that could not be adapted for SARS."" There were no data sharing protocols between jurisdictions. The report recommended creating an arms-length agency at the federal level, to ""reduce the chances that the health of Canadians would inadvertently be held hostage in a jurisdictional disagreement among levels of government"".  As a result of the review, Canada created the arms-length Public Health Agency of Canada and similar agencies at the provincial level.  Healthcare workers help a visitor going to the intensive care unit put on a gown and mask to protect against contracting SARS at North York Hospital in Toronto [File: Mike Cassese/Reuters]  Dr Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada's Public Health Agency, said that in the years following SARS, the country's agencies work together through a federal-provincial-territorial council.  ""This allows us to stand up very quickly, such as in this instance [with the novel coronavirus],"" she said.  Unlike during SARS, there are also now cross-jurisdictional response plans in place for biological agents and influenza pandemics, she added.  The SARS epidemic exposed a lack of international cooperation, so in 2007, WHO implemented its International Health Regulations (IHR), an agreement between 196 countries to build their capacities to detect, assess and report public health events.  Travel and trade restrictions can be economically devastating for countries, so, to avoid travel restrictions, the IHR includes specific measures at ports, airports and ground crossings to prevent the spread of viruses across international borders.  Despite the improvements, however, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedro Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday called for reforming the current system for declaring international emergencies to potentially a three-phase system.  Screening and training  China now has travel restrictions in place in Hubei province where the virus originated, and 45 million people are under quarantine.  When travellers arrive in Canada from China, they interact with primary inspection kiosks that scan passports, take a photo of them, and ask them to declare goods. These kiosks are now programmed to ask about travel history to Wuhan and Hubei province.  If travellers say they have visited the relevant areas of China, that information is flagged to a border agent who will ask questions about their health.  If travellers develop symptoms, they are directed to call health professionals to notify them in advance that they recently travelled to Hubei province, so that healthcare workers can be prepared and shield themselves with protective gear.  McGeer said professionals would be cleaning their hands carefully, wearing gloves and protective gowns, face shields to protect their skin and eyes, and a respirator that prevents them from inhaling the virus.  Compared with SARS, McGeer said there is no difference in what health professionals are wearing or doing.  ""If anything the precautions we were using at the beginning of SARS were more stringent than what we're using now, because we know more about coronaviruses than we used to. But our practice in using [protective gear] is better, and generally speaking, our healthcare workers are much better trained,"" she said.  Because McGeer has been in a similar situation, she said feels for the Chinese healthcare workers, patients and their families.  ""I've been there, albeit, on a much smaller scale, our outbreak was not as large, and it was different because it was primarily in hospitals, and this outbreak is not the same, but it's the same thing in terms of intensity of testing, and shortages of things, and just the chaos of trying to take care of patients well in an outbreak when many things are uncertain.""",en,diseas,,

Coronavirus: What is a global health emergency and how could it affect you?  How dangerous is the new 'mystery' coronavirus?  The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency after the deaths of 170 people in China and the spread of the disease across the globe.  The decision came in the WHO's third meeting to discuss the crisis, after it previously declined to take such a step.  What is a global health emergency?  Officially called a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), it is defined as ""an extraordinary event"" that poses a public health risk through the international spread of disease which could require an international response.  Image: A worker in a protective suit disinfects the Dongxinzhuang village in Shandong province  It suggests a situation that is ""serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected"" which may need an immediate response.  Advertisement  It is considered a call to action and a ""last resort"" measure.  How many global health emergencies have there been?  Since 2009, there have been five:  The 2009 swine flu pandemic; the 2014 polio declaration; the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa; the 2015-16 Zika virus epidemic; and the Kivu Ebola epidemic as of July 2019.  Any new subtype of human influenza is automatically declared a global health emergency - such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), smallpox, and wild type poliomyelitis.  Why has it taken so long for coronavirus to be declared one?  The virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS which killed nearly 650 people across China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.  But after several meetings over the past week, the WHO had stopped short of declaring a global emergency.  Its declaration could now trigger containment and information-sharing guidelines and may disappoint Beijing, which has expressed confidence in defeating the virus.  Thousands on ship lockdown over virus fears  Trade and travel restrictions are also possible, meaning holidaymakers might have their plans affected in some parts of the world.  Experts say it could also affect the Chinese economy.  ""The fear is that they (the WHO) might raise the alarm bells... so people are taking money off the table,"" said Chris Weston, from Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.  Image: People in Hong Kong have formed enormous queues for protective masks  Image: Shoppers in Hong Kong wear masks as the government shut down parts of the border  What happens next?  The declaration will trigger recommendations to all countries aimed at preventing or reducing the spread of the virus, while avoiding unnecessary interference with trade and travel.  The WHO said its greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, who may not be able to contain it.  WHO chief: We don't know what damage virus could do  ""We are all in this together and we can only stop it together,"" said the WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  Didier Houssin, the chairman of the emergency committee, said it would hold countries to account over extra measures they may take.  Although the organisation has no legal authority, it can ask governments to provide scientific justification for any trade or travel restrictions.  Is this like SARS?  Unlike SARS, which also originated in China, it is believed the new virus can spread during the incubation period of one to 14 days - possibly before an infected person shows symptoms.  So far, the new coronavirus does not appear to be as deadly SARS, but there have been more cases overall.  Where has it spread so far?  The vast majority of nearly 8,000 cases so far identified have been in China, mostly in and around the city of Wuhan.  Image: Air Asia flight attendants arrived in Kuala Lumpur wearing face masks  Image: People line up outside a drugstore to buy masks in Shanghai  Other countries with confirmed cases include Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, the UAE, the US and Vietnam.  The WHO is looking closely at cases of person-to-person transmission outside Wuhan, which would suggest that the virus has the potential to spread further.  Race to develop coronavirus vaccine  What are authorities doing?  Around 60 million people are under lockdown in China's Hubei province - of which Wuhan is the capital.  Wuhan's local transport networks - including bus, subway and ferries - were suspended from 10am on 23 January, and airport and train stations closed.

This developed as China's health commission reported on Friday that the confirmed cases of infection have reached 9,692.  Another 102,000 people were also reportedly under medical observation with possible symptoms of the respiratory ailment.  The UN health agency defines an international emergency as an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.  More:  China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December.  Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.  Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries - including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam - where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.  Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China.  ""The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,"" he said.  ""Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.""  ""This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,"" he said. ""On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak.""  China-Russia border closed  In response, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman said Beijing has confidence and capability to win the war against the outbreak.  Hua Chunying, the ministry spokeswoman, also said China will continue to work with the WHO and other countries to maintain global and regional public health security.  A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries.  The announcement also imposes more disease-reporting requirements on countries.  Medical staff in protective suits treat a patient with pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, in Wuhan, Hubei province [File: China Daily via Reuters]  In the wake of numerous airlines cancelling flights to China and several businesses have temporarily closed hundreds of shops, Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China.  ""There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,"" he said.  He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.  ""During my discussion with the president and other officials, they're willing to support countries with weaker health systems with whatever is possible,"" Tedros said.  Meanwhile, Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile (4,180 kilometre) border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak.  It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1.  In another development, Beijing announced on Friday that it is sending charter planes to bring back citizens from Hubei who are overseas ""as soon as possible"".  This is in view of ""practical difficulties that Hubei citizens, especially those from Wuhan, have faced overseas"", said Hua, of the ministry of foreign affairs.",en,diseas,,

Despite the continued violence, the Trump administration says it is considering reducing the number of US troops fighting terrorist groups and assisting local forces in the country from approximately 12,000 to 8,600 even in the absence of an agreement with the Taliban aimed at reducing violence and jump-starting talks between the insurgents and the internationally backed government in Kabul.

A flight carrying passengers from China lands at RAF Brize Norton near Oxford, Britain January 31, 2020. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez  Officials had warned that the United Kingdom was highly likely to have cases of the new coronavirus, which first emerged in ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s central province of Hubei and has killed 213 people so far.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The patients are receiving specialist National Health Service (NHS) care and we are using tried and tested infection-control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,Ã¢â‚¬Â said EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty.  He said the two infected patients, who local media said had been staying at a hotel in the city of York, had been transferred to a specialist infectious disease unit in Newcastle, northeast England.  Whitty said it could turn out to be a relatively minor infection as there was only a 2% mortality rate.  Staff, other patients and the general public would not be at risk, he said and health officials were tracing those who had been in close contact with the pair.  Whitty also said they were extending their advice so that anyone who had returned from China should Ã¢â‚¬Å“self-isolateÃ¢â‚¬Â if they developed symptoms of any kind.  On Thursday, Britain raised the perceived risk level to the country from an outbreak of coronavirus in China to moderate from low after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.

The returning Britons will be quarantined for 14 days at an NHS facility in northwest England.  One of those on board, Ben Williams, told BBC TV he had just got married in China and had been on his honeymoon. He said he had been forced to leave behind his wife, a Chinese national, because they had not had time to arrange for her to come.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hopefully itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only a few months,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“It (SARS) was unknown, she just came in like any ordinary person,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the senior consultant with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).  Advertisement  Advertisement  The country was ill-prepared for the outbreak at the time, she said, noting there were not enough isolation rooms and efforts then were based out of the old Communicable Disease Centre compound on Moulmein Road Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which has since been replaced by the NCID.  The new facility is better placed to handle the Wuhan coronavirus situation, she noted.  The NCID, which officially opened in September last year, has more than 330 isolation rooms at its Jalan Tan Tock Seng location.  Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS affected 8,098 people worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths across 17 countries.  Advertisement  Advertisement  In Singapore, 238 were infected, resulting in the deaths of 33 people here.  For her work in tackling the SARS crisis, Dr Ang received the National Day Award (Medal of Valour) and the Courage Medal.  Dr Ang - who also chairs Tan Tock Seng HospitalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infection control committee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also played a role in controlling the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Eighteen people died in that outbreak here.  THE CURRENT SITUATION  The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a ""global emergency"".  As of Saturday morning, there were more than 11,000 confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus worldwide, with 258 reported deaths, all in China.  Singapore now has 16 confirmed cases of the virus, including a 47-year-old Singaporean who travelled to Wuhan with her family.  In dealing with the virus, Singapore has learned many lessons from dealing with SARS 17 years ago, she said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Each outbreak is different, but the core principles remain the same.Ã¢â‚¬Â  These include Ã¢â‚¬Å“very strict compliance with infection control measuresÃ¢â‚¬Â, as well as ensuring accurate information gets disseminated to stem rumours and misinformation.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Part of the reaction to any outbreak response is managing fears on the ground, as well as coming up with relevant recommendations,Ã¢â‚¬Â she noted.  For example, while frontline staff at NCID such as doctors and nurses - as well as others such as security staff who may also have to deal with patients - may need to wear masks, this is not necessary for everyone.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in finance, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to wear a mask,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  While morale is generally high, she acknowledges that there are concerns among staff who are dealing with the current coronavirus situation.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are fears, especially for those who didn't go through SARS,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dr Ang.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I saw Singapore's first SARS case, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still alive and standing,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.  The work of handling patients cannot be just be left to junior staff, she said, adding senior staff including consultants must also be seen to be doing their part.  Senior anesthetists were among the first to volunteer to be on call during the SARS crisis in 2003, she noted.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seniors cannot just be hiding in their offices, they have to be there.Ã¢â‚¬Â  On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected.

Sweeping new restrictions will also be imposed on American citizens, with those returning from the province at the disease's epicentre placed in facilities for mandatory 14-day quarantines, said Health Secretary Alex Azar.  Advertisement  Advertisement  US citizens coming from other parts of China will undergo health screening at ports of entry and then be placed under monitored self-quarantine at home.  ""I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,"" said Azar during a briefing at the White House, adding the directives would take effect on Feb 2 from 5pm eastern time (2200 GMT).  ""Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents, who have travelled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time,"" he added.  The restrictions apply to people who have travelled to the designated areas in the two weeks prior to their attempted entry.  Advertisement  Advertisement  There have been six confirmed US cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, which originated in a live seafood market in Wuhan, in Hubei province, in December.  The World Health Organization has already declared the epidemic a global emergency, and the Chinese death toll rose Friday to 213 while total infections reached nearly 10,000, surpassing the SARS epidemic of two decades ago.  Three US airlines, American, Delta and United said they would soon suspend all flights to China.  FIRST FEDERAL QUARANTINE IN 50 YEARS  Earlier, officials imposed mandatory 14-day quarantine orders on 195 Americans who were air evacuated from Wuhan, the first time a federal directive of this kind was issued for more than 50 years. The last case involved a person who was evaluated for smallpox in the 1960s.  A plane carrying the repatriated citizens, who include diplomats and their families, touched down at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, on Wednesday and officials initially said the passengers would be asked to voluntarily isolate themselves for up to 72 hours.  Early signs were good, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared that none of the individuals showed symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.  One of the individuals tried to leave the base and was placed under quarantine by the state of California, said CDC official Marty Citron, before the federal action.  QUESTIONS OVER TEST ACCURACY  The repatriated group submitted samples for testing at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta - but officials now say they are not certain about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools.  ""We are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital, we've seen people who had detectable virus, and they didn't have the technical virus, and then three days later they had detectable virus,"" said Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.  Given that the extent of asymptomatic transmission was not yet clear, a negative test was not being used as a release criteria.  ""It isn't like it's a horrible test, but it is not a test that's absolute,"" added CDC immunologist Anthony Fauci.  Despite the seemingly drastic actions, the US public ""should not let fear or panic guide your actions,"" said senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, but instead exercise normal precautions for stopping the spread of respiratory viruses.  These include washing your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, disinfecting surfaces, staying home when sick and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and then throwing it in the trash.  ""We do not currently recommend the use of facemasks for the general American public,"" said Messonnier. ""This virus is not spreading in your communities.""  ""Please do not assume that just because someone is of Asian descent that they have this new coronavirus,"" she added, noting there are four million Chinese Americans in the US.

Referring to a circulating text message that contains a list of ""places to avoid"" in Singapore, NEA said that there is no need for members of the public to avoid these locations.

Acting clinical director for the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Dr Shawn Vasoo told CNA that rumours claiming members of the public can get the coronavirus infection from walking through certain places is Ã¢â‚¬Å“categorically untrueÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“You don't get infection typically from places, but from infected persons. So I would say that the messages that have been going out on WhatsApp and other social media Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ we should not be spreading them because it causes an unnecessary degree of paranoia and worry amongst people.

Dr Vasoo also said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“close contactÃ¢â‚¬Â typically refers to people who are living in the same household, those who are caring for someone who might be infected, or those who are the same space for a prolonged period of time.

Two work at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop in Cavan Road, in Lavender, that caters to Chinese tour groups.  The third is a maid of one of the women, while the fourth is a tour guide who had taken groups to the same shop.  The tour group in question has since returned to China.  In addition, another two confirmed cases were announced on Tuesday (Feb 4).  The two were among a group of 92 people flown back to Singapore from Wuhan on a Scoot flight last Thursday. Before this, another two on the same flight had been reported as confirmed cases.  In total, there are now 24 confirmed cases in Singapore.  Four of the new cases constitute ""limited local transmission"", the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday.

Should that happen, Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions - such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, and paring down non-essential care services - to slow the spread of disease.  The country has been preparing for such clusters, and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters to the broader community, MOH said.  As surveillance has been stepped up, more such local clusters are expected, including more cases of local transmission, it added.  The ministry has also started contact tracing to ring-fence the cluster and limit further spread.  Cases with limited community transmission are not unexpected, said Mr Gan, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force to defend the country against the virus.  ""This is a scenario which we are prepared for,"" he said, noting that efforts will help reduce the risk of escalation.  ""As the situation evolves, we will step up our posture accordingly to further contain the situation in Singapore.""  With local transmission happening here, the Government is stepping up cleaning of public areas, as well as measures to lower the risk for vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly.  To keep students safe, for instance, schools will implement staggered recess times, and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps. Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large-scale gatherings.  As an added precaution, the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China.  In addition, all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, since last week.  Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals, and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility. Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often, especially high-traffic areas.

ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG    The earlier 18 confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported, comprising 16 Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.  One has been discharged, said the ministry on Tuesday.  The update was given after a two-day lull on Sunday and Monday, when no new cases were reported.  The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community, it must prepare for a long fight against the virus, Mr Gan had told Parliament on Monday.  The coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan late last year. As of Monday, it had infected more than 20,000 people and claimed over 420 lives, mainly in China.

Outside mainland China, there have been close to 300 cases and two deaths, one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.  Global authorities have warned of more person-to-person spread, with the United States, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission.  On Tuesday, Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10. They said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China - including one from Wuhan. But he showed symptoms only on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia.  Chinese data suggests that the coronavirus, while much more contagious than Sars, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at Wuhan's South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission.  Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non-essential travel to China, while visitors with recent travel to China or those with Chinese passports will not be allowed entry here.  The six new cases  - The 19th case is a 28-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who had no recent travel history to China. She works as a sales staff member at health product shop Yong Thai Hang at 24, Cavan Road, in Lavender, that primarily served Chinese tourists.  She developed a sore throat and fever on Jan 29 and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) last Thursday, but was discharged from hospital after her chest X-Ray result came back negative for pneumonia.  She did not leave her home in Jalan Bukit Merah from Friday to Sunday and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.  - The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She lived in Hougang Street 61 and also worked at Yong Thai Hang.  She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Monday.  Related Story Interactive: What we know so far about the coronavirus  Related Story Interactive: Places impacted by the coronavirus so far  - The 21st case is a 44-year-old Indonesian woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She is the domestic helper of case 19, and stayed with her employer in her home in Jalan Bukit Merah. She reported symptoms on Sunday and had not left her home since then.  She was admitted to SGH on Monday.  - The 22nd and 23rd cases are Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. They did not have symptoms when they boarded the flight and were quarantined when they landed in Singapore.  The two cases tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday even though they still showed no symptoms.  They are now warded in isolation rooms at NCID.  All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were, as an added precaution, tested for the coronavirus.  - Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singapore resident who had no recent travel history in China.  She is a tour guide who took groups to Yong Thai Hang, the same shop where cases 19 and 20 worked.  The tour guide did not show any symptoms when she went to NCID on Monday. She was immediately isolated and is now warded in an isolation room in the centre.  She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday afternoon.

Volunteers in protective suits disinfect a railway station as the country is hit by an outbreak of the new coronavirus, in Changsha, Hunan province, China February 4, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS  ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s markets steadied after anxiety erased some $400 billion in market value from ShanghaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s benchmark index the previous day, and global markets also staged a comeback after a sell-off last week, but the bad news kept coming.  Macau, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest gambling hub, said it had asked all casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks to help curb the spread of the virus.  In another announcement that will compound worries about the economic impact, Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) said it would gradually suspend production at its South Korean factories because of supply chain disruptions from the outbreak.  The Hong Kong death took to 427 the toll from the virus, including a man who died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak.  Chinese authorities said the toll in mainland China rose by a record 64 from the previous day to 425, mostly in Hubei, the virtually locked-down province whose capital is Wuhan.  Singapore reported six more cases, including four local transmissions, taking its tally of infections to 24, the health ministry said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Though four of these cases constitute a local transmission cluster, there is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission in Singapore,Ã¢â‚¬Â it said in a statement.  New cases were reported in the United States, including a patient in California infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China.  It was the second instance of person-to-person spread in the United States after a case reported last week in Illinois.  The total number of infections in mainland China rose by 3,235 to 20,438, and there were nearly 200 cases elsewhere across 24 countries and ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen, including its mortality rate and transmission routes.  Such uncertainties have spurred extreme measures by some countries to stem the spread.  Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to an island in the Indian Ocean, while Japan ordered the quarantine of a cruise ship with more than 3,000 aboard after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for the virus.  ON STRIKE  In Hong Kong, hospital staff said the 39-year-old male victim had a pre-existing chronic illness and had visited Wuhan in January before falling ill.  Thousands of medical workers in the former British colony held a second day of strikes to press for the complete closure of its borders with mainland China, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam left open three remaining checkpoints.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Cheng, a 26-year-old nurse among the strikers.  The Asian financial centre has confirmed 17 cases of the virus and its public hospital network is struggling to cope with a deluge of patients and measures to contain the epidemic.  Hong Kong was badly hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that emerged from China in 2002 to kill almost 800 people worldwide. WHO figures show SARS killed 299 people in Hong Kong then.  Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.  In Wuhan, authorities started converting a gymnasium, exhibition centre and cultural complex into makeshift hospitals with more than 3,400 beds for patients with mild infections, the official Changjiang Daily said.  The United States said on Friday it would block nearly all foreign visitors who have been to China within the past 14 days, joining Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam and others with similar restrictions.  China accused the United States on Monday of scaremongering and said on Tuesday it would welcome its help to fight the outbreak.  The White House said China had accepted its offer of U.S. experts among a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus.  With Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing.  Many airlines have stopped flights to parts of China, with JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest carrier, ANA Holdings (9202.T), the latest to announce cuts, saying it would slash the number of flights to Beijing by two-thirds for at least seven weeks.  Hong KongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) plans to cut 30% of its global capacity over the short term, including 90% of capacity to mainland China.  Slideshow (20 Images)  Organisers of the Singapore Airshow said a meeting of about 300 international aviation officials had been cancelled although the show itself would go ahead this month.

3819697,cnn,Joshua Berlinger Junko Ogura Emiko Jozuka,Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan quarantined after passenger diagnosed with coronavirus,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_asia/~3/FE_Y6gHe5_0/index.html,,5/2/2020 4:12,"Tokyo (CNN) Japanese authorities are racing to contain a possible outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus after it was revealed that an infected passenger flew into Tokyo and spent a few days aboard a Princess Cruises ship, forcing authorities to lock down the vessel and quarantine thousands of people on board .  The ship, the Diamond Princess, ended its planned 14-day itinerary early and is currently docked off the coast of Yokohama, not far from the Japanese capital. Medical officials are going room-by-room to check each guests' temperature and medical condition, Japan's health ministry said in a statement. Several passengers have reported feeling ill, and the tests to check if they contracted the virus will take four to five hours, the ministry said.  Passengers and crew will now be required to stay on board until at least Tuesday night.  There are 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew members on board, Princess Cruises said in a statement.  A member of the media checks his phone as the Diamond Princess cruise ship sits anchored in quarantine off the port of Yokohama on Tuesday.  Japan has previously reported 20 cases of the novel coronavirus, all unrelated to the cruise.  Though Japanese officials have moved quickly to respond to this case, it has renewed concern about just how easy it could be for one patient who is unwittingly carrying the virus to pass it on in an increasingly globalized world where millions of people travel at ease.  Health authorities say patients can be infectious even if they are not presenting symptoms. The incubation period is believed to be about 14 days. However, researchers are still working to determine whether the Wuhan coronavirus can spread via what's known as the fecal-oral route, an important factor in determining just how infections the virus is, said Dr. John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at the University of Hong Kong.  However, Nicholls cautioned against panic because there are just too many unknowns surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus and this case to determine how widely one individual could spread the virus.  ""These days, you can fly anywhere, so there's going to be more chance that isolated cases my come up in other countries,"" Nicholls said. ""At this stage there's no evidence of wide spreading in other communities.""  The man who tested positive for the virus is an 80-year-old from Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese city said in a statement. The infected patient had not been to healthcare facilities or seafood markets, nor had he had exposure to wild animals during his incubation period -- meaning he likely contracted the virus from another human. The man visited mainland China for ""a few hours"" on January 10, the statement said.  The man flew into Tokyo -- the world's most populous city -- on January 17 with his two daughters, and two days later said he began developing a cough, Hong Kong authorities said. He boarded the cruise in Yokohama on January 20, and when it stopped back in Hong Kong on January 25, part of its pre-planned itinerary, he got off and never returned. He sought medical attention on January 30 and was diagnosed with the virus shortly after. He is currently in a stable condition.  Princess Cruises, which is owned by the Miami and London-headquartered Carnival Corporation, said in its statement that the man did not visit the ship's medical center.  It's also unclear how many passengers may have disembarked early. The Japanese health ministry said it is tracing people who may have disembarked in Okinawa, the cruise's second-to-last stop. The ministry is also investigating the infected patient's movements during his time in Japan but must rely on authorities in Hong Kong for information since the patient is there, authorities said.  Health authorities were screening guests on the Diamond Princess Tuesday.  Some 6,000 passengers on a cruise ship in Italy were quarantined last week after two guests were suspected of having the Wuhan coronavirus. Italy's health ministry said tests revealed the duo had a different flu virus, not the coronavirus that has spread through China.  Several cruise lines have announced measures aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. Princess Cruises and Carnival Cruises have all enacted controls barring guests from ships if they have traveled from or through mainland China in the 14 days prior to the departure date of the cruise. Royal Caribbean took similar action, but extended the date to 15 days and also included Hong Kong as well as mainland China.  Health workers are seen on board the Diamond Princess in this photograph taken by a passenger.  More cases and more travel advisories  The novel coronavirus has infected more than 20,000 people in the two months since it has been identified, and killed 427 people -- 425 people in mainland China, a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong, who died Tuesday.  The vast majority of the cases have been confirmed in Hubei province. Its capital, Wuhan, is believed to be the epicenter of the outbreak. The city has been essentially locked down and about 60 million people throughout Hubei are under some sort of travel restriction to stop the spread of the virus.  More than 185 cases have been confirmed in over 25 places worldwide, prompting countries and airlines around the world to place varying levels of travel restrictions on China.  The most stringent appear to be in the United States, banning all foreign nationals who have entered China in the last 14 days. Washington has faced criticism for its move at home and abroad. Some, like Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, have called the Trump administration's guidelines opaque and confusing. Beijing also slammed the US decision as an overreaction that would feed into mass hysteria about the virus.  ""The US government hasn't provided any substantial assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its Embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers. All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Monday.  Hua also said the US decision to bar foreigners who had been to China in recent days was likely a violation of their civil rights and was rejected by the World Health Organization (WHO).  The WHO said last week that it was advising countries to enact ""measures to limit the risk of exportation or importation of the disease,"" but without what it called ""unnecessary restrictions of international traffic.""",en,diseas,,

A day later, the group visited a health product shop at 24 Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, among other places.  CASE 19    Case 19 is a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident who works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang, a complementary health product shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists. She has no recent travel history to China.  She reported having a sore throat and fever on Jan 29 and sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day, MOH said.  View of Yong Thai Hang 24 Cavan Road.

She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Jan 31 to Feb 2. On Feb 3, she was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and tested positive for the novel coronavirus past 11pm on the same day.    MOH's director of services Associate Professor Kenneth Mak told reporters that the patient had not met the ""case definition"" on Jan 30 because she did not have pneumonia when she was checked at TTSH and had no recent travel history to China.  The situation changed on Feb 3 when she went to SGH, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia, Assoc Prof Mak said.    CASE 20  Case 20 is a 48-year-old Singaporean woman who also works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang. She has no recent travel history to China.  The woman, who stays at Hougang Street 61, reported onset of symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 3. Details of her movements between those dates were not provided.  ""Given that she is a colleague of case 19, she was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated,"" MOH said in a press release. Test results confirmed the infection on Tuesday morning.  CASE 21  Case 21 is case 19Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s domestic helper. The 44-year-old Indonesian national has no recent travel history to China and resided at Jalan Bukit Merah as well.  She reported onset of symptoms on Feb 2 and did not leave her place of residence. She was also admitted to SGH on Feb 3. She was tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Tuesday afternoon.

3822395,channelnewsasia,None,Cold symptoms that people normally 'shrug off' make mild cases of COVID-19 hard to detect: Experts,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-cold-symptoms-mild-cases-asymptomatic-12783758,,3/6/2020 12:38,"SINGAPORE: Some patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms may have only had a slight fever, according to preliminary findings from a local study, which helps explain why coronavirus cases have sometimes been hard to detect.  On Thursday (May 28), authorities said that among pre-school staff members, 13 individuals have tested positive for COVID-19 out of more than 33,000 tested.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The Ministry of HealthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak said on Thursday that most of the pre-school staff who tested positive are not infectious, as these were not active infections but old ones. The majority were also asymptomatic cases.  From May 18 to May 28, at least 27 out of 57 COVID-19 cases found in the community were asymptomatic. The cases found from active testing of pre-school staff are among them.  Infectious diseases expert Alex Cook said that he is Ã¢â‚¬Å“not too concernedÃ¢â‚¬Â about the newly detected asymptomatic infections, since it was known that a fraction of infections are asymptomatic from quite early in the pandemic.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Ã¢â‚¬Å“While the number seems very surprising at first, especially if you scale it up to the whole population, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s less worrying than (it) initially appears. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known that there is probably undiagnosed infections, but these findings start to shed light on how much there has been so far,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the vice-dean of research from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore.  Professor Cook added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop asymptomatic cases per se, but we can try to stop them from contributing to the epidemic, by doing sweeps just like this one. Mass testing has been one of the cornerstones of KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success in bringing their epidemic under control.Ã¢â‚¬Â  MANY WITH MILD SYMPTOMS  Case details published by MOH also show that, of the cases since May 18, about 10 people went to work despite onset of symptoms. Among them are a 58-year-old woman who went to work at Bishan MRT station, three women who work at various pre-schools and a few who were on duty at worker dormitories Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where the majority of the coronavirus infections are now centred.  Data from studies have suggested about 80 per cent of COVID-19 patients will experience mild symptoms and remain relatively well, about 15 per cent will develop more severe disease, mainly pneumonia, and about 5 per cent of those infected may require critical care.  For those with mild symptoms, it can be just a mild fever which goes away after the first two days of illness, according to an ongoing study by the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.  The qualitative study, which started from March, examines COVID-19 patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experiences through in-depth interviews. One of the preliminary findings from the study was that many patients initially had mild and non-specific symptoms, so it was hard for them to decide to seek medical care.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Because the symptoms were very mild, some of the interviewees just did not suspect this was COVID-19,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dr Mark Chen, NCIDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head of research, in response to media queries about why some patients may have gone to work despite the onset of symptoms. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But there could also be other reasons, and we are working with our partners to understand this issue better.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This is one of the reasons the virus is so hard to control, said Professor Cook.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The symptoms for many cases, and probably for most cases early in the infection, are quite Ã¢â‚¬ËœgenericÃ¢â‚¬â„¢: They may resemble the kinds of colds that we routinely shrug off,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The pre-school staff, in particular, are probably exposed to so many bugs through their work that it would be natural for them or their GP (general practitioner) not to have suspected this was COVID-19.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I hope with the increase in testing capacity we can test all cases with any suspect symptoms arriving in primary care, as that should help cut transmission substantially.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Singapore has swab tested 218,996 people as of May 25, equivalent to about 38,400 people tested per million of its population.  WHEN SHOULD I SEE A DOCTOR?  Since the start of the outbreak, MOH has advised people to consult a doctor if they have fever, cough and other flu-like symptoms. They are to be issued five days of medical leave and are required to stay at home for the duration.  Authorities have also provided an online symptom checker which helps the public determine if they are at risk. Among the symptoms on its checklist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ difficulty breathing, cough, a fever of above 37.5 degrees Celsius, sore throat, diarrhea, a runny nose and loss of taste or smell. Many of these are not specific to COVID-19.  While the loss of taste and smell, or anosmia, is relatively specific for COVID-19, it is present in less than half of all COVID-19 patients, NCID said. A number of people with mild symptoms have reportedly tested positive for the disease after noticing this particular symptom.  For non-specific symptoms, such as sore throats, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harder to tell.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would say, if by the next day things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get better, or if additional symptoms develop, then it is a signal that one should see a doctor and be properly evaluated,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dr Chen.  This is particularly if there are other factors that may increase the risk of catching COVID-19. Dr Chen pointed out that MOH is now updating the public daily on some places that COVID-19 patients visited.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Those that visited these places need to be extra vigilant if symptoms develop. Because even if we scale up our capacity to test for COVID-19, which the Ministry of Health has already done, to get tested, you have to go seek help in the first place,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you have symptoms, then go to Public Health Preparedness Clinic or polyclinic, and let the doctors there assess you accordingly.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Professor Cook also noted that with increased testing, authorities will find more COVID-19 cases.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This could cause the numbers of diagnosed cases to rise. However, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better to have sweeps than no sweeps, so perversely a rise in the total number of cases may actually be a good thing in terms of the control of the epidemic,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.

The 11th Ebola outbreak in the vast central African country's history comes just weeks before it had hoped to declare the end of the 10th in the east.  Health Minister Eteni Longondo said that ""4 people have already died"" from Ebola in a district of the northwestern city of Mbandaka.  ""The National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) has confirmed to me that samples from Mbandaka tested positive for Ebola,"" Longondo told a press conference on Monday.  ""We will send them the vaccine and medicine very quickly,"" he said, adding that he planned to visit the site of the outbreak at the end of the week.  The capital of Equateur province, Mbandaka is a transport hub on the Congo River with a population of more than a million.  Equateur province was previously hit by an Ebola outbreak between May and July 2018, in which 33 people died and 21 recovered from the disease.  ""This is a province that has already experienced the disease. They know how to respond. They started the response at the local level yesterday (Sunday),"" Longondo said.  The eastern epidemic  The Ebola epidemic in the country's east has killed 2,280 people since August 2018, and officials had hoped to be able to proclaim it over on June 25.  For it to be officially over, there have to be no new cases reported for 42 days Ã¢â‚¬â€œ double the incubation period.  The eastern epidemic was just 3 days away from being declared over on April 10 when a new case was reported.  Seven new cases were then recorded, including 4 deaths, two recoveries and one patient who fled, and the clock was restarted on May 14.  The World Health Organization also extended its Public Health Emergency of International Concern designation for the epidemic, which has mainly affected the North Kivu province.  Two experimental vaccines have been widely deployed to fight the outbreak, with more than 300,000 people vaccinated across the country.  However efforts to contain Ebola in the east have been hindered by attacks on health workers and conflicts in the country's volatile region, long riven by militia killings and ethnic violence.  The eastern Ebola outbreak is the second worst in history, after an epidemic in 2014 killed about 11,000 people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Coronavirus, measles  The newest Ebola outbreak is the 11th in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the highly contagious hemorrhagic fever was identified in 1976 in Equateur province in the country then known as Zaire.  The virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person.  The death rate is typically high, ranging up to 90% in some outbreaks, according to the WHO.  The country is also fighting its own surging coronavirus outbreak, recording 3,195 infections Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2,896 in the capital Kinshasa Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and 72 deaths, according to official figures released Monday.  ""We are in an ascending period of the curve,"" Longondo said, adding that it was still too ""risky"" to lift measures imposed on March 20 to stem the spread of COVID-19.  Under the measures, travel is banned between Kinshasa and the rest of the country.  No coronavirus cases have been reported in Equateur province. Mbandaka is 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Kinshasa, but the two cities are connected by the Congo river, with a trip down it taking about a week.  DR Congo's coronavirus front man, virologist Jean-Jacques Muyembe, first identified Ebola in 1976 along with Belgian Peter Piot.  ""I have devoted all my life and all my career to fighting Ebola,"" Muyembe has said.  The country is also facing a measles outbreak which has killed more than 6,000 people since early last year, as well as recurring flare-ups of cholera and malaria. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rappler.com",en,diseas,,
3823573,cnn,Mary Ilyushina,Belarus strongman faces mass protests after jailing of his main rivals,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/europe/belarus-protests-intl/index.html,21/6/2020 0:00,22/6/2020 11:48,"(CNN) Mass protests are spreading across Belarus as opposition to the reelection campaign of President Alexander Lukashenko grows, local media and human-rights organizations have reported.  Lukashenko has ruled the former Soviet republic of more than 9 million people since 1994 and is running for the sixth time in an election scheduled for August 9. He has long drawn international criticism for suppressing dissent, and the country's secret police -- still known as the KGB -- often detain and harass opposition activists and independent journalists.  Demonstrations on Friday, in which thousands marched on the streets of 10 cities, were prompted by a series of arrests, in what the opposition activists called an attempt to take popular candidates out of the presidential race. Two of Lukashenko's main opponents are currently in KGB and police detention: popular YouTube blogger Sergei Tikhanovskiy, who was detained in late May, and former Belgazprombank chairman Viktor Babaryko, who was arrested on June 18 along with his son and campaign manager, Eduard Babaryko, according to their campaigns.  Following the news of the latest arrest, activists started forming ""human chains of solidarity,"" some of which stretched from to several kilometers, according to the organizers and local media reports  The independent non-governmental organization Viasna , which monitors protest activity in Belarus, reported Saturday that at least 120 people were detained overnight, including many journalists.  On Friday, Lukashenko said the protests are a foreign plot and claimed that the country's law enforcement ""thwarted a Maidan,"" alluding to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that ousted the country's pro-Russian president.  ""We managed to take some steps ahead of schedule and quash the large-scale plan to destabilize Belarus,"" Lukashenko said according to state-run news agency BelTA . ""We showed the true faces of the puppets we had here and puppeteers who sit outside Belarus.  ""Don't make me choose. If I behave myself in a democratic way, if I show them that I'm so warm and fuzzy, I have a chance to lose the country altogether,"" Lukashenko added.  Babaryko is considered to be Lukashenko's main opponent in this presidential election. His campaign says they have collected 425,000 signatures in support of his candidacy, passing the bar of 100,000 signatures.  The country does not have reliable independent political polling, but in early June, a meme ""Sasha three percent"" was trending on Belarusian social media, referring to low numbers for Lukashenko in unofficial polls from independent online outlets. Sasha is a nickname for Alexander.  Eduard Babaryko's girlfriend said in a Facebook post Thursday he is being questioned in the KGB detention center on tax evasion charges. Lawyers for Viktor Babaryko said they have not been able to visit their client. As of Saturday, the Babarykos have not been released.  The arrest was preceded by a series of police raids in Babaryko's offices and apartments of his family members. Head of the Belarusian Committee of State Control Ivan Tertel said that 20 current and former bank executives linked to Babaryko have been arrested on various charges, including tax evasion and embezzlement, and confessed that ""Babaryko is the organizer of a criminal scheme.""  Babaryko denies any wrongdoing and says the charges were politically motivated.  Protesters hold their hands in the air during a rally in Minsk on June 19.  Lukashenko has claimed that several candidates running against him in this election have ties to Russia. Several Belarusian outlets called Babaryko ""a Kremlin-linked candidate"" as he ran Belgazprombank, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom, for the past 20 years. Babaryko himself denied the allegation and asked the media not to call him a pro-Russian candidate. Lukashenko has long cultivated close relations with Russia, which has close economic ties and a customs union with Belarus.  ""[Lukashenko] is doing it because of the roadmap on deep integration with Russia... in which Belarus loses its sovereignty, and it prompted a wave of public outrage,"" Babaryko said in an interview with Russia's independent news outlet RBC . ""So now any hint that something is done to benefit Russia or any other state causes [negative] reaction within Belarusian society.""  The Kremlin has also denied it supports Babaryko and dismissed accusations against Gazprom.  President Alexander Lukashenko speaks during a summit on December 20, 2019 in St. Petersburg, Russia.  ""The Kremlin does not have candidates in Belarusian elections,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said earlier this week.  Putin and Lukashenko exchanged a phone call this week but did not discuss the situation around the Belgazprombank, according to Peskov. Lukashenko is expected to visit Moscow next week to attend a rescheduled Victory Day parade on Red Square.  UK and US governments condemned the arrests and urged the Belarusian authorities to respect the right of its citizens for peaceful protest.  ""The United States urges the Belarusian government to uphold its international commitments to respect fundamental freedoms by allowing the Belarusian people to freely, peacefully assemble and releasing those detained, including journalists covering tonight's peaceful gathering,"" the US Embassy in Minsk Twitter account said in a tweet.",en,others,,

In a meeting with the families of the 14 missing Liberty 5 crew at the PCG headquarters in Manila, commandant Vice Admiral George Ursabia Jr said the PCG on Tuesday, July 7, filed a court pleading to prevent the Vienna WoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crew from going home to China, particularly those it tagged in a criminal case.  The PCG would also issue a hold departure order against the Vienna Wood to keep the bulk carrier under Philippine custody until the case is resolved, Ursabia added.  The victimsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ relatives and the Liberty 5 owner Irma Fishing and Trading said they planned to file a separate civil case against the Vienna Wood. Ursabia promised assistance, saying they may use the PCGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s criminal complaint to bolster their case.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rest assured po na ang Coast Guard, tutulong sa inyo. Alam ko po na masakit talaga ang ganitong sitwasyon. Ipagdasal po natin ito sa Panginoon. Wala pong ibang makakatulong sa atin kundi Diyos lang,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ursabia told the families.  (Rest assured that the Coast Guard will help you. I know this situation is really painful. Let us pray for this to the Lord. No one else can help us but God.)  Active search called off  Ursabia also told the families that the PCG concluded its active search for the missing mariners on Tuesday, July 7. Nine days of seaborne and aerial operations off Occidental Mindoro and northern Palawan yielded no sign of the victims.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sa ngayon, wala pa rin tayong nakita na katawan, but we cannot declare them dead. There is still a possibility na buhay pa sila. Lahat naman tayo naniniwala sa Diyos. It is too early para sabihin na patay na sila, kaya ang masasabi natin, missing pa rin sila.Ã¢â‚¬Â Ursabia told the grieving families.  (As of now, we still havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found bodies, but we cannot declare them dead. There is still a possibility that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still alive. We all believe in God. It is too early to say theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dead, so all we can say is theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still missing)  The PCG, Philippine Air Force, Philippine National Police Maritime Group, the Bureau of Fire Protection, and several local governments deployed vessels and planes to search the waters between Occidental Mindoro and northern Palawan for the 11 crew and 3 passengers who were aboard the Liberty 5 when it capsized from the collision.  With full search-and-retrieval operations ended, Ursabia said the local PCG unit will keep Ã¢â‚¬Å“actively monitoringÃ¢â‚¬Â the area for any sign of the missing persons. This includes the surrounding coastlines, in case the victims are washed ashore.  Full jurisdiction  The PCG on Monday, July 6, formally accused the Vienna WoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operator Nomikos Transworld Maritime and 7 of the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s officers of Ã¢â‚¬Å“reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide and damage to propertyÃ¢â‚¬Â before the Occidental Mindoro ProsecutorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Office.  The Vienna Wood crew did not actively attempt to save the distressed Liberty 5 crew and passengers when they collided around 14 nautical miles off Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro on the night of June 27, Ursabia earlier said.  The Vienna WoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ship master, Zhang Weiwei, allegedly said his crew prioritized maintaining a safe distance from some 7 smaller vessels that had come to the Liberty 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s aid after the impact.  The Vienna Wood is based in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China. The 7 officers named in the case were Chinese.  During his meeting with the victimsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ families, Ursabia denied rumors some of the missing mariners were kept hidden aboard the Vienna Wood. The PCG searched the entire cargo ship and found none of them, he said.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Neither is there pressure from China to meddle in the case. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear we have full jurisdiction because the incident happened in our waters,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ursabia added.  After the meeting, the PCG, PCG Auxiliary Executive Squadron, and Civil Relations Special Support Squadron gave financial assistance to the victimsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ families, the PCG said in a statement.

The bodies of men were dumped in groups of up to 20 under bridges, in fields and in vacant lots, the rights group said in a new report.  The killings took place between November 2019 and June this year and the majority of the dead were found by residents within 5km (three miles) of the government-controlled town of Djibo, in the country's Sahel region, it said.  ""So many of the dead were blindfolded, had their hands tied up... and were shot in the head,"" one of the town's community leaders told HRW.  In a three-page letter to HRW, the ministry of defence pledged to investigate the mass graves.  It said the killings occurred during an uptick in attacks by armed fighters and suggested they could have been carried out by these groups who were using stolen army uniforms and equipment.  ""It is difficult for the population to distinguish between armed terrorist groups and the defence and security forces,"" Minister of Defence Moumina Cheriff Sy said.  This is the latest in a string of growing accusations of extrajudicial killings on Burkina Faso's military, which is struggling to stem armed violence that has spread across the country, internally displacing almost a million people.  Last month, Amnesty International documented gross human rights violations committed by the security forces between March and April, including forced disappearances and killings.  In May, 12 people who had been arrested as suspected armed fighters were found dead in cells in eastern Burkina Faso after being held overnight, according to a government statement at the time.  A local rights group and civilians have said the government was responsible for the deaths.  ""The growing number of allegations of extrajudicial killings by the army is deeply worrying, and the lack of progress on investigations suggests a lack of political will,"" Corinne Dufka, HRW's West Africa director, told The Associated Press news agency.  ""Djibo reidents should feel protected by, not terrified of, their own army. The government's failure to make good on promises of accountability for past allegations of security force abuse, including in Djibo, appears to have emboldened the perpetrators,"" Dufka said.  ""The authorities need to put an end to unlawful killings through credible and independent investigations.""  Epicentre of violence  The report, based on 23 interviews, alleged that government security forces were responsible for the majority of the killings and that most of the victims were ethnic Fulani herders, who had been blindfolded, bound and shot.  The country's Fulani ethnic group, who are generally Muslim, have been increasingly targeted by the military and local defence forces for their alleged affiliation with the armed groups, rights groups have said.  Djibo, where many Fulanis live, has been at the epicentre of the violence and has been blockaded for months as armed fighters have put landmines in the roads leading to the town.  Several locals told the AP news agency that it is common to see bodies strewn along the road in the morning.  Burkina Faso has been battling armed groups with links to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) since 2017.  Hundreds of civilians have been killed and almost a million displaced by the conflict, which is also affecting neighbours Niger and Mali.",en,terrorattack,,

Ã¢â‚¬Å“I want to know why they did it,Ã¢â‚¬Â Brad Downey, an American artist who commissioned the sculpture, told Reuters. If the suspect or suspects are caught, Downey said, he would like to interview them for a film heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making that will be part of an upcoming exhibition of his work in the first lady's native country.  The life-size crude rendering of the first lady was carved out of a tree trunk by a local artist and unveiled last summer.  MELANIA TRUMP HONORED WITH ODD STATUE LIKENED TO A 'SCARECROW' IN HER SLOVENIAN HOMETOWN  Downey, who filed a police report regarding the vandalism, said he had envisioned the statue as a way to highlight the fact that the first lady is an immigrant in a U.S. administration vowing to reduce illegal immigration and some forms of legal immigration, Reuters reported.  The statue has been controversial since its inception with some saying it looked more like a Ã¢â‚¬Å“scarecrowÃ¢â‚¬Â than the first lady.  Earlier this year, a wooden statue of President Trump in Slovenia was burned to the ground, according to BBC News.  In the U.S., statues of historical figures have become targets of protesters since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.  Monuments to Confederate leaders were the protesters' initial targets. They then moved on to slaveholders Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and other controversial figures such as Christopher Columbus, whose legacy is complicated.  Protesters often vandalize statues with graffiti, pull them down with ropes or set them on fire.  Amid the vandalism of statues of figures deemed to be racist, others have been targeted as well. Protesters in Wisconsin this month ripped down the ""Forward"" statue, a depiction of a woman who symbolizes progress, and last weekend, vandals in Rochester, N.Y., pulled down and damaged a monument to abolitionist Frederick Douglass.  The vandalism of statues has gone worldwide. Even one of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill was defaced in London.

The move came days after China imposed a sweeping new national security law on the financial hub after months of civil unrest last year.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Voters were due to cast their ballots in Saturday's primary to select opposition candidates for election to the city's legislative council in September.  Police claimed that they were responding to a report that computers belonging to the Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) had been hacked, resulting in an unlawful leak of personal information.  But former lawmaker Au Nok-hin, who was helping to organise the weekend vote, said he believed police were attempting to interfere with the workings of the city's political opposition.  ""The incident is very likely related to the primaries and meant to create a deterrent effect,"" he said in a statement.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Chung Kim-wah, a scientist working with PORI, said that officers had a warrant demanding the seizure of all computers.  He told AFP that the timing of the raid was ""highly coincidental"" but said the seizure would not affect Saturday's vote.  The independent pollster has issued a number of political surveys gauging public opinion on the popularity of city officials and police.  Public trust in both has plummeted since the months of occasionally violent political protests that rocked Hong Kong last year, prompted by a now-shelved bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.  The latest poll from PORI released Friday found that 61 per cent of respondents believed that Hong Kong was no longer a ""free city"" since the introduction of the national security law last week.  Opponents say the legislation - which sets out new penalties for ""subversion"" and other offences - undermines the liberties guaranteed to the city in a 50-year agreement signed when Britain handed back control of the city to China in 1997.",en,others,,
3882811,bbci,Bbc News Eleanor Lawrie,Coronavirus: What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52135342,,6/7/2020 20:13,"Image copyright Getty Images  More than nine million workers who are unable to do their job because of the coronavirus outbreak have had their wages paid by the government.  The furlough scheme was designed to help people put on leave because of the outbreak, and prevent mass redundancies.  Firms have to start paying towards the scheme from August, and it will close entirely in October. So, if you've been put on furlough, what are your rights?  How is the furlough scheme changing?  The Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme puts workers on leave but allows them to stay on their company's payroll.  Originally, furloughed employees couldn't do any work for their employer, but they can now go back to work part-time.  For example, an employer could pay someone to work two days a week, while the furlough scheme would cover the other three days not worked.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said employers must start sharing the cost of the scheme from August  From 1 August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff.  In September, employers will have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October.  Those workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Ã‚Â£2,500 a month.  Can I be made redundant while on furlough?  Yes. Employees can be made redundant at any point during the scheme, or when it ends. If they are entitled to redundancy pay it would be calculated based on the amount they earned before furlough.  Firms can't use the money from furlough to subsidise redundancy packages. If you're made redundant while on furlough because your firm has gone bust, you can apply for payments from the Insolvency Service.  Can I work if I've been furloughed?  When the scheme began, furloughed staff weren't able to do any work for their employer. However, they can now be brought back to work on a part-time basis.  This coincides with the reopening of the hospitality sector in England, which was particularly badly hit by the lockdown. Some furloughed staff will be able to return to work at pubs, bars and restaurants when they open to the public in England on 4 July.  In the meantime, those on furlough can volunteer in the community or even for their company as long as they aren't creating revenue or providing a service.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Furloughed workers can volunteer in the community  Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage for the period spent doing the training.  If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to Ã‚Â£2,500 a month per employer.  You can continue working for any that still need you or start working for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts.  How popular has the scheme been?  The take-up has been significant, with 9.3 million workers furloughed since March.  Employers had made Ã‚Â£25.5bn of furlough claims by 28 June, and the scheme will cost the government an estimated Ã‚Â£80bn in total.  The scheme covers full-time, part-time, flexible, zero-hour and agency workers if they were on their employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020.  Workers must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and can be furloughed more than once.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Employers can use an online calculator to work out how much to claim  How can my business apply?  Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator.  Companies can claim 80% of their employees' wages - capped at Ã‚Â£2,500 per employee per month before tax, or Ã‚Â£576.92 a week.  Employers can top up this pay if they wish, and must let workers know they have been furloughed.  If employees' pay varies each month, companies will need to calculate the claim manually, or seek professional advice.  Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built into an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses.  HMRC will check the claim, and pay you through a UK bank within about six working days.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apprentices can be furloughed and continue their training  Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but most claims are from private sector businesses and charities.  Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE.  The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions.  They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than Ã‚Â£50,000 in a tax year. Those who receive it can continue to work.  The grant is offered as a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of Ã‚Â£7,500. Applications for a second grant will open in August.  Will I still get sick pay and a bonus?  Anyone on furlough retains the same employment rights. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough.  If you are on unpaid leave, shielding or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government.  Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage.",en,others,,
